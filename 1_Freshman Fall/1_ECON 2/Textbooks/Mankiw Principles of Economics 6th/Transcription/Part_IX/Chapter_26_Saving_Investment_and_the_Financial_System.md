Saving, Investment, and 
    the Financial System 
I
magine that you have just graduated from college (with a degree in econom-
ics, of course) and you decide to start your own business—an economic fore-
casting firm. Before you make any money selling your forecasts, you have to 
incur substantial costs to set up your business. You have to buy computers 
with which to make your forecasts, as well as desks, chairs, and filing cabinets to 
furnish your new office. Each of these items is a type of capital that your firm will 
use to produce and sell its services. 
How do you obtain the funds to invest in these capital goods? Perhaps you 
are able to pay for them out of your past savings. More likely, however, like most 
entrepreneurs, you do not have enough money of your own to finance the start 
of your business. As a result, you have to get the money you need from other 
sources. 
There are various ways to finance these capital investments. You could bor-
row the money, perhaps from a bank or from a friend or relative. In this case,

you would promise not only to return the money at a later date but also to pay 
interest for the use of the money. Alternatively, you could convince someone to 
provide the money you need for your business in exchange for a share of your 
future profits, whatever they might happen to be. In either case, your investment 
in computers and office equipment is being financed by someone else’s saving.
The financial system consists of the institutions that help to match one per-
son’s saving with another person’s investment. As we discussed in the previous 
chapter, saving and investment are key ingredients to long-run economic growth: 
When a country saves a large portion of its GDP, more resources are available for 
investment in capital, and higher capital raises a country’s productivity and liv-
ing standard. The previous chapter, however, did not explain how the economy 
coordinates saving and investment. At any time, some people want to save some 
of their income for the future, and others want to borrow to finance investments in 
new and growing businesses. What brings these two groups of people together? 
What ensures that the supply of funds from those who want to save balances the 
demand for funds from those who want to invest? 
This chapter examines how the financial system works. First, we discuss the 
large variety of institutions that make up the financial system in our economy. 
Second, we discuss the relationship between the financial system and some key 
macroeconomic variables—notably saving and investment. Third, we develop a 
model of the supply and demand for funds in financial markets. In the model, the 
interest rate is the price that adjusts to balance supply and demand. The model 
shows how various government policies affect the interest rate and, thereby, soci-
ety’s allocation of scarce resources.
Financial Institutions in the U.S. Economy
At the broadest level, the financial system moves the economy’s scarce resources 
from savers (people who spend less than they earn) to borrowers (people who 
spend more than they earn). Savers save for various reasons—to put a child 
through college in several years or to retire comfortably in several decades. 
Similarly, borrowers borrow for various reasons—to buy a house in which to live 
or to start a business with which to make a living. Savers supply their money to 
the financial system with the expectation that they will get it back with interest at 
a later date. Borrowers demand money from the financial system with the knowl-
edge that they will be required to pay it back with interest at a later date. 
The financial system is made up of various financial institutions that help coor-
dinate savers and borrowers. As a prelude to analyzing the economic forces that 
drive the financial system, let’s discuss the most important of these institutions. 
Financial institutions can be grouped into two categories: financial markets and 
financial intermediaries. We consider each category in turn.
Financial Markets
Financial markets are the institutions through which a person who wants to save 
can directly supply funds to a person who wants to borrow. The two most impor-
tant financial markets in our economy are the bond market and the stock market.
The Bond Market  When Intel, the giant maker of computer chips, wants to 
borrow to finance construction of a new factory, it can borrow directly from the 
public. It does this by selling bonds. A bond is a certificate of indebtedness that

specifies the obligations of the borrower to the holder of the bond. Put simply, a 
bond is an IOU. It identifies the time at which the loan will be repaid, called the 
date of maturity, and the rate of interest that will be paid periodically until the loan 
matures. The buyer of a bond gives his or her money to Intel in exchange for this 
promise of interest and eventual repayment of the amount borrowed (called the 
principal). The buyer can hold the bond until maturity or can sell the bond at an 
earlier date to someone else.
There are literally millions of different bonds in the U.S. economy. When large 
corporations, the federal government, or state and local governments need to bor-
row to finance the purchase of a new factory, a new jet fighter, or a new school, 
they usually do so by issuing bonds. If you look at The Wall Street Journal or the 
business section of your local newspaper, you will find a listing of the prices and 
interest rates on some of the most important bond issues. These bonds differ 
according to three significant characteristics. 
The first characteristic is a bond’s term—the length of time until the bond 
matures. Some bonds have short terms, such as a few months, while others have 
terms as long as thirty years. (The British government has even issued a bond 
that never matures, called a perpetuity. This bond pays interest forever, but the 
principal is never repaid.) The interest rate on a bond depends, in part, on its 
term. Long-term bonds are riskier than short-term bonds because holders of 
long-term bonds have to wait longer for repayment of principal. If a holder of 
a long-term bond needs his money earlier than the distant date of maturity, he 
has no choice but to sell the bond to someone else, perhaps at a reduced price. 
To compensate for this risk, long-term bonds usually pay higher interest rates 
than short-term bonds.
The second important characteristic of a bond is its credit risk—the probability 
that the borrower will fail to pay some of the interest or principal. Such a failure to 
pay is called a default. Borrowers can (and sometimes do) default on their loans by 
declaring bankruptcy. When bond buyers perceive that the probability of default 
is high, they demand a higher interest rate to compensate them for this risk. 
Because the U.S. government is considered a safe credit risk, government bonds 
tend to pay low interest rates. By contrast, financially shaky corporations raise 
money by issuing junk bonds, which pay very high interest rates. Buyers of bonds 
can judge credit risk by checking with various private agencies, such as Standard & 
Poor’s, which rate the credit risk of different bonds.
The third important characteristic of a bond is its tax treatment—the way the 
tax laws treat the interest earned on the bond. The interest on most bonds is tax-
able income; that is, the bond owner has to pay a portion of the interest in income 
taxes. By contrast, when state and local governments issue bonds, called municipal 
bonds, the bond owners are not required to pay federal income tax on the interest 
income. Because of this tax advantage, bonds issued by state and local govern-
ments typically pay a lower interest rate than bonds issued by corporations or the 
federal government.
The Stock Market  Another way for Intel to raise funds to build a new semi-
conductor factory is to sell stock in the company. Stock represents ownership in 
a firm and is, therefore, a claim to the profits that the firm makes. For example, if 
Intel sells a total of 1,000,000 shares of stock, then each share represents ownership 
of 1/1,000,000 of the business. 
The sale of stock to raise money is called equity finance, whereas the sale of 
bonds is called debt finance. Although corporations use both equity and debt

a claim to partial 
ownership in a firm

finance to raise money for new investments, stocks and bonds are very different. 
The owner of shares of Intel stock is a part owner of Intel, while the owner of an 
Intel bond is a creditor of the corporation. If Intel is very profitable, the stock-
holders enjoy the benefits of these profits, whereas the bondholders get only the 
interest on their bonds. And if Intel runs into financial difficulty, the bondholders 
are paid what they are due before stockholders receive anything at all. Compared 
to bonds, stocks offer the holder both higher risk and potentially higher return.
After a corporation issues stock by selling shares to the public, these shares 
trade among stockholders on organized stock exchanges. In these transactions, 
the corporation itself receives no money when its stock changes hands. The 
most important stock exchanges in the U.S. economy are the New York Stock 
Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, and the NASDAQ (National Association 
of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system). Most of the world’s countries 
have their own stock exchanges on which the shares of local companies trade. 
The prices at which shares trade on stock exchanges are determined by the 
supply of and demand for the stock in these companies. Because stock represents 
ownership in a corporation, the demand for a stock (and thus its price) reflects 
people’s perception of the corporation’s future profitability. When people become 
optimistic about a company’s future, they raise their demand for its stock and 
thereby bid up the price of a share of stock. Conversely, when people come to 
expect a company to have little profit or even losses, the price of a share falls.
Various stock indexes are available to monitor the overall level of stock 
prices. A stock index is computed as an average of a group of stock prices. The 
most famous stock index is the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has been 
computed regularly since 1896. It is now based on the prices of the stocks of 
thirty major U.S. companies, such as General Electric, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, 
Walt Disney Company, AT&T, and IBM. Another well-known stock index is the 
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which is based on the prices of the stocks of 500 
major companies. Because stock prices reflect expected profitability, these stock 
indexes are watched closely as possible indicators of future economic conditions. 
Financial Intermediaries
Financial intermediaries are financial institutions through which savers can indi-
rectly provide funds to borrowers. The term intermediary reflects the role of these 
institutions in standing between savers and borrowers. Here we consider two of 
the most important financial intermediaries: banks and mutual funds.
Banks  If the owner of a small grocery store wants to finance an expansion of 
his business, he probably takes a strategy quite different from that of Intel. Unlike 
Intel, a small grocer would find it difficult to raise funds in the bond and stock 
markets. Most buyers of stocks and bonds prefer to buy those issued by larger, 
more familiar companies. The small grocer, therefore, most likely finances his 
business expansion with a loan from a local bank.
Banks are the financial intermediaries with which people are most familiar. A 
primary job of banks is to take in deposits from people who want to save and use 
these deposits to make loans to people who want to borrow. Banks pay depositors 
interest on their deposits and charge borrowers slightly higher interest on their 
loans. The difference between these rates of interest covers the banks’ costs and 
returns some profit to the owners of the banks.
Besides being financial intermediaries, banks play a second important role in 
the economy: They facilitate purchases of goods and services by allowing people 
to write checks against their deposits and to access those deposits with debit cards.

In other words, banks help create a special asset that people can use as a medium 
of exchange. A medium of exchange is an item that people can easily use to engage 
in transactions. A bank’s role in providing a medium of exchange distinguishes it 
from many other financial institutions. Stocks and bonds, like bank deposits, are 
a possible store of value for the wealth that people have accumulated in past sav-
ing, but access to this wealth is not as easy, cheap, and immediate as just writing a 
check or using a debit card. For now, we ignore this second role of banks, but we 
will return to it when we discuss the monetary system later in the book.
Mutual Funds  A financial intermediary of increasing importance in the U.S. 
economy is the mutual fund. A mutual fund is an institution that sells shares to 
the public and uses the proceeds to buy a selection, or portfolio, of various types 
of stocks, bonds, or both stocks and bonds. The shareholder of the mutual fund 
accepts all the risk and return associated with the portfolio. If the value of the 
portfolio rises, the shareholder benefits; if the value of the portfolio falls, the 
shareholder suffers the loss. 
The primary advantage of mutual funds is that they allow people with small 
amounts of money to diversify their holdings. Buyers of stocks and bonds are

 Key Numbers for Stock Watchers
W
hen following the stock of any company, you should keep an 
eye on three key numbers. These numbers are reported on the 
financial pages of some newspapers, and you can easily obtain them 
from online news services:
• Price. The single most important piece of information about 
a stock is the price of a share. News services usually present 
several prices. The “last” or “closing” price is the price of the 
last transaction that occurred before the stock exchange closed 
in its most recent day of trading. A news service may also give 
the “high” and “low” prices over the past day of trading and, 
sometimes, over the past year as well. It may also report the 
change from the previous day’s closing price.
• Dividend. Corporations pay out some of their profits to their 
stockholders; this amount is called the dividend. (Profits not paid 
out are called retained earnings and are used by the corpora-
tion for additional investment.) News services often report the 
dividend paid over the previous year for each share of stock. 
They sometimes report the dividend yield, which is the dividend 
expressed as a percentage of the stock’s price. 
• Price-earnings ratio. A corporation’s earnings, or 
accounting profit, is the amount of revenue it receives for the 
sale of its products minus its costs of production as measured 
by its accountants. Earnings per share is the company’s total 
earnings divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding. 
The price-earnings ratio, often called the P/E, is the price of 
a corporation’s stock divided by the amount the corporation 
earned per share over the past year. Historically, the typical 
price-earnings ratio is about 15. A higher P/E indicates that a 
corporation’s stock is expensive relative to its recent earnings; 
this might indicate either that people expect earnings to rise in 
the future or that the stock is overvalued. Conversely, a lower 
P/E indicates that a corporation’s stock is cheap relative to its 
recent earnings; this might indicate either that people expect 
earnings to fall or that the stock is undervalued.
	
Why do news services report all these data? Many people who 
invest their savings in stock follow these numbers closely when 
deciding which stocks to buy and sell. By contrast, other stockhold-
ers follow a buy-and-hold strategy: They buy the stock of well-run 
companies, hold it for long periods of time, and do not respond to 
the daily fluctuations.

well advised to heed the adage: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Because the 
value of any single stock or bond is tied to the fortunes of one company, holding a 
single kind of stock or bond is very risky. By contrast, people who hold a diverse 
portfolio of stocks and bonds face less risk because they have only a small stake in 
each company. Mutual funds make this diversification easy. With only a few hun-
dred dollars, a person can buy shares in a mutual fund and, indirectly, become 
the part owner or creditor of hundreds of major companies. For this service, the 
company operating the mutual fund charges shareholders a fee, usually between 
0.5 and 2.0 percent of assets each year.
A second advantage claimed by mutual fund companies is that mutual funds 
give ordinary people access to the skills of professional money managers. The 
managers of most mutual funds pay close attention to the developments and pros-
pects of the companies in which they buy stock. These managers buy the stock of 
companies they view as having a profitable future and sell the stock of companies 
with less promising prospects. This professional management, it is argued, should 
increase the return that mutual fund depositors earn on their savings.
Financial economists, however, are often skeptical of this second argument. 
With thousands of money managers paying close attention to each company’s 
prospects, the price of a company’s stock is usually a good reflection of the com-
pany’s true value. As a result, it is hard to “beat the market” by buying good 
stocks and selling bad ones. In fact, mutual funds called index funds, which buy 
all the stocks in a given stock index, perform somewhat better on average than 
mutual funds that take advantage of active trading by professional money manag-
ers. The explanation for the superior performance of index funds is that they keep 
costs low by buying and selling very rarely and by not having to pay the salaries 
of the professional money managers.
Summing Up
The U.S. economy contains a large variety of financial institutions. In addition to 
the bond market, the stock market, banks, and mutual funds, there are also pen-
sion funds, credit unions, insurance companies, and even the local loan shark. 
These institutions differ in many ways. When analyzing the macroeconomic role 
of the financial system, however, it is more important to keep in mind the similar-
ity of these institutions than the differences. These financial institutions all serve 
the same goal: directing the resources of savers into the hands of borrowers.

 Financial Crises
I
n 2008 and 2009, the U.S. economy and many other major econo-
mies around the world experienced a financial crisis, which in turn 
led to a deep downturn in economic activity. We will examine these 
events in detail later in this book, but here we can outline the key 
elements of financial crises.
	
The first element of a financial crisis is a large decline in some 
asset prices. In 2008 and 2009, that asset was real estate. The price 
of housing, after experiencing a boom earlier in the decade, fell 
by about 30 percent over just a few years. Such a large decline in 
real estate prices had not been seen in the United States since the 
1930s.
	
The second element of a financial crisis is insolvencies at finan-
cial institutions. In 2008 and 2009, many banks and other financial 
firms had in effect placed bets on real estate prices by holding 
mortgages backed by that real estate. When house prices fell, 
large numbers of homeowners stopped repaying their loans. These 
defaults pushed several financial institutions toward bankruptcy.
	
The third element of a financial crisis is a decline in confidence 
in financial institutions. While some deposits in banks are insured 
by government policies, not all are. As insolvencies mounted, 
every financial institution became a possible candidate for the next 
bankruptcy. Individuals and firms with uninsured deposits in those 
institutions pulled out their money. Facing a rash of withdrawals, 
banks started selling off assets (sometimes at reduced “fire-sale” 
prices), and they cut back on new lending.
	
The fourth element of a financial crisis is a credit crunch. With 
many financial institutions facing difficulties, would-be borrowers 
had trouble getting loans, even if they had profitable investment 
projects. In essence, the financial system had trouble performing its 
normal function of directing the resources of savers into the hands 
of borrowers with the best investment opportunities.
	
The fifth element of a financial crisis is an economic downturn. 
With people unable to obtain financing for new investment projects, 
the overall demand for goods and services declined. As a result, for 
reasons we discuss more fully later in the book, national income fell 
and unemployment rose.
	
The sixth and final element of a financial crisis is a vicious circle. 
The economic downturn reduced the profitability of many companies 
and the value of many assets. Thus, we returned to step one, and 
the problems in the financial system and the economic downturn 
reinforced each other.
	
Financial crises, such as that of 2008 and 2009, can have severe 
consequences. Fortunately, they do end. Financial institutions even-
tually get back on their feet, perhaps with some help from govern-
ment policy, and they return to their normal function of financial 
intermediation.
Saving and Investment in the National Income Accounts
Events that occur within the financial system are central to understanding devel-
opments in the overall economy. As we have just seen, the institutions that make 
up this system—the bond market, the stock market, banks, and mutual funds—
have the role of coordinating the economy’s saving and investment. And as we 
saw in the previous chapter, saving and investment are important determinants of 
long-run growth in GDP and living standards. As a result, macroeconomists need 
to understand how financial markets work and how various events and policies 
affect them.
As a starting point for an analysis of financial markets, we discuss in this sec-
tion the key macroeconomic variables that measure activity in these markets. Our 
emphasis here is not on behavior but on accounting. Accounting refers to how

various numbers are defined and added up. A personal accountant might help an 
individual add up her income and expenses. A national income accountant does 
the same thing for the economy as a whole. The national income accounts include, 
in particular, GDP and the many related statistics.
The rules of national income accounting include several important identities. 
Recall that an identity is an equation that must be true because of the way the 
variables in the equation are defined. Identities are useful to keep in mind, for 
they clarify how different variables are related to one another. Here we consider 
some accounting identities that shed light on the macroeconomic role of financial 
markets.
Some Important Identities
Recall that gross domestic product (GDP) is both total income in an economy 
and the total expenditure on the economy’s output of goods and services. GDP 
(denoted as Y) is divided into four components of expenditure: consumption (C), 
investment (I), government purchases (G), and net exports (NX). We write
Y = C + I + G + NX.
This equation is an identity because every dollar of expenditure that shows up 
on the left side also shows up in one of the four components on the right side. 
Because of the way each of the variables is defined and measured, this equation 
must always hold.
In this chapter, we simplify our analysis by assuming that the economy we 
are examining is closed. A closed economy is one that does not interact with other 
economies. In particular, a closed economy does not engage in international trade 
in goods and services, nor does it engage in international borrowing and lending. 
Actual economies are open economies—that is, they interact with other economies 
around the world. Nonetheless, assuming a closed economy is a useful simplifica-
tion with which we can learn some lessons that apply to all economies. Moreover, 
this assumption applies perfectly to the world economy (for interplanetary trade 
is not yet common).
Because a closed economy does not engage in international trade, imports and 
exports are exactly zero. Therefore, net exports (NX) are also zero. In this case, we 
can write
Y = C + I + G.
This equation states that GDP is the sum of consumption, investment, and gov-
ernment purchases. Each unit of output sold in a closed economy is consumed, 
invested, or bought by the government.
To see what this identity can tell us about financial markets, subtract C and G 
from both sides of this equation. We obtain
Y – C – G = I.
The left side of this equation (Y – C – G) is the total income in the economy that 
remains after paying for consumption and government purchases: This amount is 
called national saving, or just saving, and is denoted S. Substituting S for Y – C – G, 
we can write the last equation as 
S = I.
This equation states that saving equals investment.

## Page 563

To understand the meaning of national saving, it is helpful to manipulate the 
definition a bit more. Let T denote the amount that the government collects from 
households in taxes minus the amount it pays back to households in the form 
of transfer payments (such as Social Security and welfare). We can then write 
national saving in either of two ways:
S = Y – C – G
or
S = (Y – T – C) + (T – G).
These equations are the same because the two Ts in the second equation cancel 
each other, but each reveals a different way of thinking about national saving. In 
particular, the second equation separates national saving into two pieces: private 
saving (Y – T – C) and public saving (T – G). 
Consider each of these two pieces. Private saving is the amount of income that 
households have left after paying their taxes and paying for their consumption. 
In particular, because households receive income of Y, pay taxes of T, and spend 
C on consumption, private saving is Y – T – C. Public saving is the amount of tax 
revenue that the government has left after paying for its spending. The govern-
ment receives T in tax revenue and spends G on goods and services. If T exceeds 
G, the government runs a budget surplus because it receives more money than it 
spends. This surplus of T – G represents public saving. If the government spends 
more than it receives in tax revenue, then G is larger than T. In this case, the 
government runs a budget deficit, and public saving T – G is a negative number.
Now consider how these accounting identities are related to financial markets. 
The equation S = I reveals an important fact: For the economy as a whole, saving must 
be equal to investment. Yet this fact raises some important questions: What mecha-
nisms lie behind this identity? What coordinates those people who are deciding 
how much to save and those people who are deciding how much to invest? The 
answer is the financial system. The bond market, the stock market, banks, mutual 
funds, and other financial markets and intermediaries stand between the two 
sides of the S = I equation. They take in the nation’s saving and direct it to the 
nation’s investment. 
The Meaning of Saving and Investment
The terms saving and investment can sometimes be confusing. Most people use 
these terms casually and sometimes interchangeably. By contrast, the macroecon-
omists who put together the national income accounts use these terms carefully 
and distinctly.
Consider an example. Suppose that Larry earns more than he spends and 
deposits his unspent income in a bank or uses it to buy some stock or a bond 
from a corporation. Because Larry’s income exceeds his consumption, he adds to 
the nation’s saving. Larry might think of himself as “investing” his money, but a 
macroeconomist would call Larry’s act saving rather than investment.
In the language of macroeconomics, investment refers to the purchase of new 
capital, such as equipment or buildings. When Moe borrows from the bank to 
build himself a new house, he adds to the nation’s investment. (Remember, the 
purchase of a new house is the one form of household spending that is invest-
ment rather than consumption.) Similarly, when the Curly Corporation sells some 
stock and uses the proceeds to build a new factory, it also adds to the nation’s 
investment.

Although the accounting identity S = I shows that saving and investment are 
equal for the economy as a whole, this does not have to be true for every indi-
vidual household or firm. Larry’s saving can be greater than his investment, and 
he can deposit the excess in a bank. Moe’s saving can be less than his investment, 
and he can borrow the shortfall from a bank. Banks and other financial institu-
tions make these individual differences between saving and investment possible 
by allowing one person’s saving to finance another person’s investment.

The Market for Loanable Funds
Having discussed some of the important financial institutions in our economy and 
the macroeconomic role of these institutions, we are ready to build a model of 
financial markets. Our purpose in building this model is to explain how financial 
markets coordinate the economy’s saving and investment. The model also gives 
us a tool with which we can analyze various government policies that influence 
saving and investment.
To keep things simple, we assume that the economy has only one financial 
market, called the market for loanable funds. All savers go to this market to 
deposit their saving, and all borrowers go to this market to take out their loans. 
Thus, the term loanable funds refers to all income that people have chosen to save 
and lend out, rather than use for their own consumption, and to the amount that 
investors have chosen to borrow to fund new investment projects. In the market 
for loanable funds, there is one interest rate, which is both the return to saving 
and the cost of borrowing.
The assumption of a single financial market, of course, is not literally true. As 
we have seen, the economy has many types of financial institutions. But as we 
discussed in Chapter 2, the art in building an economic model is simplifying the 
world in order to explain it. For our purposes here, we can ignore the diversity of 
financial institutions and assume that the economy has a single financial market.
Supply and Demand for Loanable Funds
The economy’s market for loanable funds, like other markets in the economy, is 
governed by supply and demand. To understand how the market for loanable 
funds operates, therefore, we first look at the sources of supply and demand in 
that market.
The supply of loanable funds comes from people who have some extra income 
they want to save and lend out. This lending can occur directly, such as when a 
household buys a bond from a firm, or it can occur indirectly, such as when a 
household makes a deposit in a bank, which in turn uses the funds to make loans. 
In both cases, saving is the source of the supply of loanable funds.
The demand for loanable funds comes from households and firms who wish to 
borrow to make investments. This demand includes families taking out mortgages 
to buy new homes. It also includes firms borrowing to buy new equipment or 
build factories. In both cases, investment is the source of the demand for loanable funds.
The interest rate is the price of a loan. It represents the amount that borrowers 
pay for loans and the amount that lenders receive on their saving. Because a high

funds

who want to save supply

interest rate makes borrowing more expensive, the quantity of loanable funds 
demanded falls as the interest rate rises. Similarly, because a high interest rate 
makes saving more attractive, the quantity of loanable funds supplied rises as the 
interest rate rises. In other words, the demand curve for loanable funds slopes 
downward, and the supply curve for loanable funds slopes upward.
Figure 1 shows the interest rate that balances the supply and demand for loana-
ble funds. In the equilibrium shown, the interest rate is 5 percent, and the quantity 
of loanable funds demanded and the quantity of loanable funds supplied both 
equal $1,200 billion. 
The adjustment of the interest rate to the equilibrium level occurs for the usual 
reasons. If the interest rate were lower than the equilibrium level, the quantity 
of loanable funds supplied would be less than the quantity of loanable funds 
demanded. The resulting shortage of loanable funds would encourage lenders 
to raise the interest rate they charge. A higher interest rate would encourage sav-
ing (thereby increasing the quantity of loanable funds supplied) and discourage 
borrowing for investment (thereby decreasing the quantity of loanable funds 
demanded). Conversely, if the interest rate were higher than the equilibrium 
level, the quantity of loanable funds supplied would exceed the quantity of loana-
ble funds demanded. As lenders competed for the scarce borrowers, interest rates 
would be driven down. In this way, the interest rate approaches the equilibrium 
level at which the supply and demand for loanable funds exactly balance. 
Recall that economists distinguish between the real interest rate and the 
nominal interest rate. The nominal interest rate is the interest rate as usually 
reported—the monetary return to saving and the monetary cost of borrowing. The 
real interest rate is the nominal interest rate corrected for inflation; it equals the 
nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Because inflation erodes the value 
of money over time, the real interest rate more accurately reflects the real return 
to saving and the real cost of borrowing. Therefore, the supply and demand for 
loanable funds depend on the real (rather than nominal) interest rate, and the 
equilibrium in Figure 1 should be interpreted as determining the real interest rate 
The Market for Loanable Funds
The interest rate in the economy 
adjusts to balance the supply and 
demand for loanable funds. The 
supply of loanable funds comes 
from national saving, including 
both private saving and public 
saving. The demand for loanable 
funds comes from firms and 
households that want to borrow 
for purposes of investment. Here 
the equilibrium interest rate is 
5 percent, and $1,200 billion of 
loanable funds are supplied and 
demanded.

in the economy. For the rest of this chapter, when you see the term interest rate, 
you should remember that we are talking about the real interest rate.
This model of the supply and demand for loanable funds shows that financial 
markets work much like other markets in the economy. In the market for milk, 
for instance, the price of milk adjusts so that the quantity of milk supplied bal-
ances the quantity of milk demanded. In this way, the invisible hand coordinates 
the behavior of dairy farmers and the behavior of milk drinkers. Once we realize 
that saving represents the supply of loanable funds and investment represents the 
demand, we can see how the invisible hand coordinates saving and investment. 
When the interest rate adjusts to balance supply and demand in the market for 
loanable funds, it coordinates the behavior of people who want to save (the sup-
pliers of loanable funds) and the behavior of people who want to invest (the 
demanders of loanable funds).
We can now use this analysis of the market for loanable funds to examine 
various government policies that affect the economy’s saving and investment. 
Because this model is just supply and demand in a particular market, we analyze 
any policy using the three steps discussed in Chapter 4. First, we decide whether 
the policy shifts the supply curve or the demand curve. Second, we determine the 
direction of the shift. Third, we use the supply-and-demand diagram to see how 
the equilibrium changes.
Policy 1: Saving Incentives
American families save a smaller fraction of their incomes than their counterparts 
in many other countries, such as Japan and Germany. Although the reasons for 
these international differences are unclear, many U.S. policymakers view the low 
level of U.S. saving as a major problem. One of the Ten Principles of Economics in 
Chapter 1 is that a country’s standard of living depends on its ability to produce 
goods and services. And as we discussed in the preceding chapter, saving is an 
important long-run determinant of a nation’s productivity. If the United States 
could somehow raise its saving rate to the level that prevails in other countries, 
the growth rate of GDP would increase, and over time, U.S. citizens would enjoy 
a higher standard of living.
Another of the Ten Principles of Economics is that people respond to incentives. 
Many economists have used this principle to suggest that the low saving rate in 
the United States is at least partly attributable to tax laws that discourage saving. 
The U.S. federal government, as well as many state governments, collects revenue 
by taxing income, including interest and dividend income. To see the effects of 
this policy, consider a 25-year-old who saves $1,000 and buys a 30-year bond 
that pays an interest rate of 9 percent. In the absence of taxes, the $1,000 grows to 
$13,268 when the individual reaches age 55. Yet if that interest is taxed at a rate 
of, say, 33 percent, then the after-tax interest rate is only 6 percent. In this case, the 
$1,000 grows to only $5,743 after 30 years. The tax on interest income substantially 
reduces the future payoff from current saving and, as a result, reduces the incen-
tive for people to save. 
In response to this problem, many economists and lawmakers have proposed 
reforming the tax code to encourage greater saving. For example, one proposal is 
to expand eligibility for special accounts, such as Individual Retirement Accounts, 
that allow people to shelter some of their saving from taxation. Let’s consider the 
effect of such a saving incentive on the market for loanable funds, as illustrated in 
Figure 2. We analyze this policy following our three steps.

First, which curve would this policy affect? Because the tax change would 
alter the incentive for households to save at any given interest rate, it would affect 
the quantity of loanable funds supplied at each interest rate. Thus, the supply of 
loanable funds would shift. The demand for loanable funds would remain the 
same because the tax change would not directly affect the amount that borrowers 
want to borrow at any given interest rate. 
Second, which way would the supply curve shift? Because saving would be 
taxed less heavily than under current law, households would increase their saving 
by consuming a smaller fraction of their income. Households would use this addi-
tional saving to increase their deposits in banks or to buy more bonds. The supply 
of loanable funds would increase, and the supply curve would shift to the right 
from S1 to S2, as shown in Figure 2.
Finally, we can compare the old and new equilibria. In the figure, the increased 
supply of loanable funds reduces the interest rate from 5 percent to 4 percent. The 
lower interest rate raises the quantity of loanable funds demanded from $1,200 
billion to $1,600 billion. That is, the shift in the supply curve moves the market 
equilibrium along the demand curve. With a lower cost of borrowing, households 
and firms are motivated to borrow more to finance greater investment. Thus, if a 
reform of the tax laws encouraged greater saving, the result would be lower interest rates 
and greater investment. 
This analysis of the effects of increased saving is widely accepted among 
economists, but there is less consensus about what kinds of tax changes should 
be enacted. Many economists endorse tax reform aimed at increasing saving to 
stimulate investment and growth. Yet others are skeptical that these tax changes 
would have much effect on national saving. These skeptics also doubt the equity 
of the proposed reforms. They argue that, in many cases, the benefits of the tax 
changes would accrue primarily to the wealthy, who are least in need of tax relief. 
Saving Incentives Increase the 
Supply of Loanable Funds
A change in the tax laws to 
encourage Americans to save 
more would shift the supply 
of loanable funds to the right 
from S1 to S2. As a result, the 
equilibrium interest rate would 
fall, and the lower interest rate 
would stimulate investment. 
Here the equilibrium interest rate 
falls from 5 percent to 4 percent, 
and the equilibrium quantity 
of loanable funds saved and 
invested rises from $1,200 billion 
to $1,600 billion.

Policy 2: Investment Incentives
Suppose that Congress passed a tax reform aimed at making investment more 
attractive. In essence, this is what Congress does when it institutes an investment 
tax credit, which it does from time to time. An investment tax credit gives a tax 
advantage to any firm building a new factory or buying a new piece of equipment. 
Let’s consider the effect of such a tax reform on the market for loanable funds, as 
illustrated in Figure 3.
First, would the law affect supply or demand? Because the tax credit would 
reward firms that borrow and invest in new capital, it would alter investment at 
any given interest rate and, thereby, change the demand for loanable funds. By 
contrast, because the tax credit would not affect the amount that households save 
at any given interest rate, it would not affect the supply of loanable funds.
Second, which way would the demand curve shift? Because firms would have 
an incentive to increase investment at any interest rate, the quantity of loanable 
funds demanded would be higher at any given interest rate. Thus, the demand 
curve for loanable funds would move to the right, as shown by the shift from D1 
to D2 in the figure.
Third, consider how the equilibrium would change. In Figure 3, the increased 
demand for loanable funds raises the interest rate from 5 percent to 6 percent, 
and the higher interest rate in turn increases the quantity of loanable funds sup-
plied from $1,200 billion to $1,400 billion, as households respond by increasing 
the amount they save. This change in household behavior is represented here as a 
movement along the supply curve. Thus, if a reform of the tax laws encouraged greater 
investment, the result would be higher interest rates and greater saving.
Policy 3: Government Budget Deficits and Surpluses
A perpetual topic of political debate is the status of the government budget. 
Recall that a budget deficit is an excess of government spending over tax revenue. 
Figure 3
Investment Incentives Increase 
the Demand for Loanable 
Funds
If the passage of an investment 
tax credit encouraged firms to 
invest more, the demand for 
loanable funds would increase. 
As a result, the equilibrium 
interest rate would rise, and 
the higher interest rate would 
stimulate saving. Here, when the 
demand curve shifts from D1 to 
D2, the equilibrium interest rate 
rises from 5 percent to 6 percent, 
and the equilibrium quantity 
of loanable funds saved and 
invested rises from $1,200 billion 
to $1,400 billion.

Governments finance budget deficits by borrowing in the bond market, and the 
accumulation of past government borrowing is called the government debt. A bud-
get surplus, an excess of tax revenue over government spending, can be used to 
repay some of the government debt. If government spending exactly equals tax 
revenue, the government is said to have a balanced budget.
Imagine that the government starts with a balanced budget and then, because 
of a tax cut or a spending increase, starts running a budget deficit. We can ana-
lyze the effects of the budget deficit by following our three steps in the market for 
loanable funds, as illustrated in Figure 4. 
First, which curve shifts when the government starts running a budget defi-
cit? Recall that national saving—the source of the supply of loanable funds—is 
composed of private saving and public saving. A change in the government 
budget balance represents a change in public saving and, thereby, in the supply 
of loanable funds. Because the budget deficit does not influence the amount that 
households and firms want to borrow to finance investment at any given interest 
rate, it does not alter the demand for loanable funds.
Second, which way does the supply curve shift? When the government runs a 
budget deficit, public saving is negative, and this reduces national saving. In other 
words, when the government borrows to finance its budget deficit, it reduces 
the supply of loanable funds available to finance investment by households and 
firms. Thus, a budget deficit shifts the supply curve for loanable funds to the left 
from S1 to S2, as shown in Figure 4.
The Effect of a 
Government Budget 
Deficit
Figure 4
When the government spends more than it receives in tax revenue, the resulting 
budget deficit lowers national saving. The supply of loanable funds decreases, and 
the equilibrium interest rate rises. Thus, when the government borrows to finance 
its budget deficit, it crowds out households and firms that otherwise would borrow 
to finance investment. Here, when the supply shifts from S1 to S2, the equilibrium 
interest rate rises from 5 percent to 6 percent, and the equilibrium quantity of 
loanable funds saved and invested falls from $1,200 billion to $800 billion.

Third, we can compare the old and new equilibria. In the figure, when the 
budget deficit reduces the supply of loanable funds, the interest rate rises from 
5 percent to 6 percent. This higher interest rate then alters the behavior of the 
households and firms that participate in the loan market. In particular, many 
demanders of loanable funds are discouraged by the higher interest rate. Fewer 
families buy new homes, and fewer firms choose to build new factories. The fall in 
investment because of government borrowing is called crowding out and is rep-
resented in the figure by the movement along the demand curve from a quantity 
of $1,200 billion in loanable funds to a quantity of $800 billion. That is, when the 
government borrows to finance its budget deficit, it crowds out private borrowers 
who are trying to finance investment.
Thus, the most basic lesson about budget deficits follows directly from their 
effects on the supply and demand for loanable funds: When the government reduces 
national saving by running a budget deficit, the interest rate rises, and investment falls. 
Because investment is important for long-run economic growth, government 
budget deficits reduce the economy’s growth rate.
Why, you might ask, does a budget deficit affect the supply of loanable funds, 
rather than the demand for them? After all, the government finances a budget 
deficit by selling bonds, thereby borrowing from the private sector. Why does 
increased borrowing from the government shift the supply curve, while increased 
borrowing by private investors shifts the demand curve? To answer this question, 
we need to examine more precisely the meaning of “loanable funds.” The model 
as presented here takes this term to mean the flow of resources available to fund pri-
vate investment; thus, a government budget deficit reduces the supply of loanable 
funds. If, instead, we had defined the term “loanable funds” to mean the flow of 
resources available from private saving, then the government budget deficit would 
increase demand rather than reduce supply. Changing the interpretation of the 
term would cause a semantic change in how we described the model, but the 
bottom line from the analysis would be the same: In either case, a budget deficit 
increases the interest rate, thereby crowding out private borrowers who are rely-
ing on financial markets to fund private investment projects.
Now that we understand the impact of budget deficits, we can turn the analy-
sis around and see that government budget surpluses have the opposite effects. 
When government collects more in tax revenue than it spends, it saves the differ-
ence by retiring some of the outstanding government debt. This budget surplus, 
or public saving, contributes to national saving. Thus, a budget surplus increases the 
supply of loanable funds, reduces the interest rate, and stimulates investment. Higher 
investment, in turn, means greater capital accumulation and more rapid economic 
growth.
The History of U.S. Government Debt
How indebted is the U.S. government? The answer to this question varies sub-
stantially over time. Figure 5 shows the debt of the U.S. federal government 
expressed as a percentage of U.S. GDP. It shows that the government debt has 
fluctuated from zero in 1836 to 107 percent of GDP in 1945.
	
The behavior of the debt-GDP ratio is one gauge of what’s happening with the 
government’s finances. Because GDP is a rough measure of the government’s tax 
base, a declining debt-GDP ratio indicates that the government indebtedness is 
crowding out
a decrease in investment 
that results from 
government borrowing

shrinking relative to its ability to raise tax revenue. This suggests that the govern-
ment is, in some sense, living within its means. By contrast, a rising debt-GDP 
ratio means that the government indebtedness is increasing relative to its ability to 
raise tax revenue. It is often interpreted as meaning that fiscal policy—government 
spending and taxes—cannot be sustained forever at current levels.
	
Throughout history, the primary cause of fluctuations in government debt is 
war. When wars occur, government spending on national defense rises substan-
tially to pay for soldiers and military equipment. Taxes sometimes rise as well but 
typically by much less than the increase in spending. The result is a budget deficit 
and increasing government debt. When the war is over, government spending 
declines, and the debt-GDP ratio starts declining as well.
	
There are two reasons to believe that debt financing of war is an appropriate 
policy. First, it allows the government to keep tax rates smooth over time. Without 
debt financing, tax rates would have to rise sharply during wars, and this would 
cause a substantial decline in economic efficiency. Second, debt financing of wars 
shifts part of the cost of wars to future generations, who will have to pay off the 
government debt. This is arguably a fair distribution of the burden, for future

generations get some of the benefit when one generation fights a war to defend 
the nation against foreign aggressors. 
	
One large increase in government debt that cannot be explained by war is the 
increase that occurred beginning around 1980. When President Ronald Reagan took 
office in 1981, he was committed to smaller government and lower taxes. Yet he 
found cutting government spending to be more difficult politically than cutting taxes. 
The result was the beginning of a period of large budget deficits that continued not 
only through Reagan’s time in office but also for many years thereafter. As a result, 
government debt rose from 26 percent of GDP in 1980 to 50 percent of GDP in 1993. 
	
As we discussed earlier, government budget deficits reduce national saving, 
investment, and long-run economic growth, and this is precisely why the rise in 
government debt during the 1980s troubled many economists and policymakers. 
When Bill Clinton moved into the Oval Office in 1993, deficit reduction was his 
first major goal. Similarly, when the Republicans took control of Congress in 1995, 
deficit reduction was high on their legislative agenda. Both of these efforts substan-
tially reduced the size of the government budget deficit, and it eventually turned 
into a surplus. As a result, by the late 1990s, the debt-GDP ratio was declining.
	
The debt-GDP ratio started rising again during the first few years of the George 
W. Bush presidency, as the budget surplus turned into a budget deficit. There 
were three reasons for this change. First, President Bush signed into law several 
major tax cuts, which he had promised during the 2000 presidential campaign. 
Second, in 2001, the economy experienced a recession (a reduction in economic 
activity), which automatically decreased tax revenue and increased government 
spending. Third, spending on homeland security following the September 11, 
2001 attacks and the subsequent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan led to increases in 
government spending.
	
Truly dramatic increase in the debt-GDP ratio started occurring in 2008, as 
the economy experienced a financial crisis and a deep recession (a topic we 
will be addressing more fully in coming chapters). The recession automatically 
increased the budget deficit, and several policy measures passed by the Bush and 
Obama administrations aimed at combating the recession reduced tax revenue 
and increased government spending even more. In 2009 and 2010, the federal 
government’s budget deficit was about 10 percent of GDP, the largest deficits 
since World War II. The borrowing to finance these deficits led to the substantial 
increase in the debt-GDP ratio shown in the figure. Putting the federal budget 
back on a sustainable path with a stable or declining debt-GDP ratio is one of the 
great policy challenges facing future generations of policymakers.  ■

Conclusion
“Neither a borrower nor a lender be,” Polonius advises his son in Shakespeare’s 
Hamlet. If everyone followed this advice, this chapter would have been unnecessary. 
Few economists would agree with Polonius. In our economy, people borrow 
and lend often, and usually for good reason. You may borrow one day to start 
your own business or to buy a home. And people may lend to you in the hope that 
the interest you pay will allow them to enjoy a more prosperous retirement. The 
financial system has the job of coordinating all this borrowing and lending activity.

Summary
• The U.S. financial system is made up of many 
types of financial institutions, such as the bond 
market, the stock market, banks, and mutual 
funds. All these institutions act to direct the 
resources of households that want to save some 
of their income into the hands of households and 
firms that want to borrow.
• National income accounting identities reveal 
some important relationships among macroeco-
nomic variables. In particular, for a closed econ-
omy, national saving must equal investment. 
Financial institutions are the mechanism through 
which the economy matches one person’s saving 
with another person’s investment.
• The interest rate is determined by the supply 
and demand for loanable funds. The supply 
of loanable funds comes from households that 
want to save some of their income and lend it 
out. The demand for loanable funds comes from 
households and firms that want to borrow for 
investment. To analyze how any policy or event 
affects the interest rate, one must consider how 
it affects the supply and demand for loanable 
funds.
• National saving equals private saving plus 
public saving. A government budget deficit 
represents negative public saving and, therefore, 
reduces national saving and the supply of 
loanable funds available to finance investment. 
When a government budget deficit crowds out 
investment, it reduces the growth of productivity 
and GDP.
Key Concepts
In many ways, financial markets are like other markets in the economy. The 
price of loanable funds—the interest rate—is governed by the forces of supply 
and demand, just as other prices in the economy are. And we can analyze shifts 
in supply or demand in financial markets as we do in other markets. One of the 
Ten Principles of Economics introduced in Chapter 1 is that markets are usually a 
good way to organize economic activity. This principle applies to financial mar-
kets as well. When financial markets bring the supply and demand for loanable 
funds into balance, they help allocate the economy’s scarce resources to their most 
efficient use.
In one way, however, financial markets are special. Financial markets, unlike 
most other markets, serve the important role of linking the present and the 
future. Those who supply loanable funds—savers—do so because they want to 
convert some of their current income into future purchasing power. Those who 
demand loanable funds—borrowers—do so because they want to invest today 
in order to have additional capital in the future to produce goods and services. 
Thus, well-functioning financial markets are important not only for current gen-
erations but also for future generations who will inherit many of the resulting 
benefits.

Questions for Review
	 1.	 What is the role of the financial system? Name 
and describe two markets that are part of the 
financial system in the U.S. economy. Name and 
describe two financial intermediaries.
	 2.	 Why is it important for people who own 
stocks and bonds to diversify their holdings? 
What type of financial institution makes 
diversification easier?
	 3.	 What is national saving? What is private 
saving? What is public saving? How are these 
three variables related?
	 4.	 What is investment? How is it related to 
national saving?
	 5.	 Describe a change in the tax code that might 
increase private saving. If this policy were 
implemented, how would it affect the market 
for loanable funds?
	 6.	 What is a government budget deficit? How does 
it affect interest rates, investment, and economic 
growth?
Problems and Applications
	 1.	 For each of the following pairs, which bond 
would you expect to pay a higher interest rate? 
Explain.
a.	 a bond of the U.S. government or a bond of 
an East European government
b.	a bond that repays the principal in year 2015 
or a bond that repays the principal in year 
2040
c.	 a bond from Coca-Cola or a bond from a 
software company you run in your garage
d.	a bond issued by the federal government or a 
bond issued by New York State
	 2.	 Many workers hold large amounts of stock 
issued by the firms at which they work. Why 
do you suppose companies encourage this 
behavior? Why might a person not want to hold 
stock in the company where he works? 
	 3.	 Explain the difference between saving and 
investment as defined by a macroeconomist. 
Which of the following situations represent 
investment? Saving? Explain.
a.	 Your family takes out a mortgage and buys a 
new house.
b.	You use your $200 paycheck to buy stock in 
AT&T.
c.	 Your roommate earns $100 and deposits it in 
her account at a bank.
d.	You borrow $1,000 from a bank to buy a car 
to use in your pizza delivery business.
	 4.	 Suppose GDP is $8 trillion, taxes are $1.5 
trillion, private saving is $0.5 trillion, and public 
saving is $0.2 trillion. Assuming this economy 
is closed, calculate consumption, government 
purchases, national saving, and investment. 
	 5.	 Economists in Funlandia, a closed economy, 
have collected the following information about 
the economy for a particular year: 
Y = 10,000 
C = 6,000 
T = 1,500 
G = 1,700 
The economists also estimate that the 
investment function is: 
I = 3,300 – 100 r, 
where r is the country’s real interest rate, 
expressed as a percentage. Calculate private 
saving, public saving, national saving, 
investment, and the equilibrium real interest 
rate. 
	 6.	 Suppose that Intel is considering building a new 
chip-making factory. 
a.	 Assuming that Intel needs to borrow money 
in the bond market, why would an increase 
in interest rates affect Intel’s decision about 
whether to build the factory?
b.	If Intel has enough of its own funds to 
finance the new factory without borrowing, 
would an increase in interest rates still affect 
Intel’s decision about whether to build the 
factory? Explain.
	 7.	 Three students have each saved $1,000. Each 
has an investment opportunity in which he or

she can invest up to $2,000. Here are the rates of 
return on the students’ investment projects:
	
Harry	
5  percent
	
Ron	
8  percent
	
Hermione	
20 percent
a.	 If borrowing and lending is prohibited, so 
each student uses only his or her saving to 
finance his or her own investment project, 
how much will each student have a year later 
when the project pays its return?
b.	Now suppose their school opens up a 
market for loanable funds in which students 
can borrow and lend among themselves at 
an interest rate r. What would determine 
whether a student would choose to be a 
borrower or lender in this market?
c.	 Among these three students, what would be 
the quantity of loanable funds supplied and 
quantity demanded at an interest rate of  
7 percent? At 10 percent?
d.	At what interest rate would the loanable 
funds market among these three students 
be in equilibrium? At this interest rate, 
which student(s) would borrow, and which 
student(s) would lend?
e.	 At the equilibrium interest rate, how much 
does each student have a year later after 
the investment projects pay their return 
and loans have been repaid? Compare your 
answers to those you gave in part (a). Who 
benefits from the existence of the loanable 
funds market—the borrowers or the lenders? 
Is anyone worse off?
	 8.	 Suppose the government borrows $20 billion 
more next year than this year.
a.	 Use a supply-and-demand diagram to 
analyze this policy. Does the interest rate rise 
or fall? 
b.	What happens to investment? To private 
saving? To public saving? To national  
saving? Compare the size of the changes 
to the $20 billion of extra government 
borrowing.
c.	 How does the elasticity of supply of loanable 
funds affect the size of these changes? 
d.	How does the elasticity of demand for 
loanable funds affect the size of these 
changes?
e.	 Suppose households believe that greater 
government borrowing today implies higher 
taxes to pay off the government debt in the 
future. What does this belief do to private 
saving and the supply of loanable funds 
today? Does it increase or decrease the effects 
you discussed in parts (a) and (b)?
	 9.	 In the summer of 2010, Congress passed a far-
reaching financial reform to prevent another 
financial crisis like the one experienced in 
2008–2009. Consider the following possibilities:
a.	 Suppose that, by requiring firms to comply 
with strict regulations, the bill increases the 
costs of investment. On a well-labeled graph, 
show the consequences of the bill on the 
market for loanable funds. Be sure to specify 
changes in the equilibrium interest rate and 
level of saving and investment. What are the 
effects of the bill on long-run economic growth?
b.	Suppose, on the other hand, that by 
effectively regulating the financial system, 
the bill increases savers’ confidence in the 
financial system. Show the consequences of 
the policy in this situation on a new graph, 
again noting changes in the equilibrium 
interest rate and level of saving and 
investment. Again evaluate the effects on 
long-run growth.
	10.	 This chapter explains that investment can be 
increased both by reducing taxes on private 
saving and by reducing the government budget 
deficit.
a.	 Why is it difficult to implement both of these 
policies at the same time?
b.	What would you need to know about private 
saving to judge which of these two policies 
would be a more effective way to raise 
investment?
