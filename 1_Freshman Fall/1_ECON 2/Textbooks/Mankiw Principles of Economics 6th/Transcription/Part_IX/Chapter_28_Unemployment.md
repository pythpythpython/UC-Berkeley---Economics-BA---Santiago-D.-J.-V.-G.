Unemployment
L
osing a job can be the most distressing economic event in a person’s life. 
Most people rely on their labor earnings to maintain their standard of liv-
ing, and many people also get a sense of personal accomplishment from 
working. A job loss means a lower living standard in the present, anxiety 
about the future, and reduced self-esteem. It is not surprising, therefore, that poli-
ticians campaigning for office often speak about how their proposed policies will 
help create jobs.
In previous chapters, we have seen some of the forces that determine the level 
and growth of a country’s standard of living. A country that saves and invests a 
high fraction of its income, for instance, enjoys more rapid growth in its capital 
stock and GDP than a similar country that saves and invests less. An even more 
obvious determinant of a country’s standard of living is the amount of unemploy-
ment it typically experiences. People who would like to work but cannot find 
a job are not contributing to the economy’s production of goods and services. 
Although some degree of unemployment is inevitable in a complex economy with

thousands of firms and millions of workers, the amount of unemployment varies 
substantially over time and across countries. When a country keeps its workers 
as fully employed as possible, it achieves a higher level of GDP than it would if it 
left many of its workers standing idle.
This chapter begins our study of unemployment. The problem of unemployment 
is usefully divided into two categories: the long-run problem and the short-run 
problem. The economy’s natural rate of unemployment refers to the amount of unem-
ployment that the economy normally experiences. Cyclical unemployment refers to 
the year-to-year fluctuations in unemployment around its natural rate, and it is 
closely associated with the short-run ups and downs of economic activity. Cyclical 
unemployment has its own explanation, which we defer until we study short-run 
economic fluctuations later in this book. In this chapter, we discuss the determi-
nants of an economy’s natural rate of unemployment. As we will see, the designa-
tion natural does not imply that this rate of unemployment is desirable. Nor does 
it imply that it is constant over time or impervious to economic policy. It merely 
means that this unemployment does not go away on its own even in the long run.
We begin the chapter by looking at some of the relevant facts that describe 
unemployment. In particular, we examine three questions: How does the gov-
ernment measure the economy’s rate of unemployment? What problems arise in 
interpreting the unemployment data? How long are the unemployed typically 
without work?
We then turn to the reasons economies always experience some unemploy-
ment and the ways in which policymakers can help the unemployed. We discuss 
four explanations for the economy’s natural rate of unemployment: job search, 
minimum-wage laws, unions, and efficiency wages. As we will see, long-run 
unemployment does not arise from a single problem that has a single solution. 
Instead, it reflects a variety of related problems. As a result, there is no easy way 
for policymakers to reduce the economy’s natural rate of unemployment and, at 
the same time, to alleviate the hardships experienced by the unemployed.
Identifying Unemployment
Let’s start by examining more precisely what the term unemployment means. 
How Is Unemployment Measured?
Measuring unemployment is the job of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which 
is part of the Department of Labor. Every month, the BLS produces data on unem-
ployment and on other aspects of the labor market, including types of employ-
ment, length of the average workweek, and the duration of unemployment. These 
data come from a regular survey of about 60,000 households, called the Current 
Population Survey.
Based on the answers to survey questions, the BLS places each adult (age 16 
and older) of each surveyed household into one of three categories: 
• 	 Employed: This category includes those who worked as paid employees, 
worked in their own business, or worked as unpaid workers in a family 
member’s business. Both full-time and part-time workers are counted.  
This category also includes those who were not working but who had jobs 
from which they were temporarily absent because of, for example, vacation, 
illness, or bad weather.

• 	 Unemployed: This category includes those who were not employed, were 
available for work, and had tried to find employment during the previous 
four weeks. It also includes those waiting to be recalled to a job from which 
they had been laid off.
• 	 Not in the labor force: This category includes those who fit neither of the first 
two categories, such as a full-time student, homemaker, or retiree.
Figure 1 shows the breakdown into these categories for 2009.
Once the BLS has placed all the individuals covered by the survey in a cat-
egory, it computes various statistics to summarize the state of the labor market. 
The BLS defines the labor force as the sum of the employed and the unemployed: 
Labor force = Number of employed + Number of unemployed.
The BLS defines the unemployment rate as the percentage of the labor force that 
is unemployed:
	
Number of unemployed
Unemployment rate = 	
 × 100.
	
Labor force
The BLS computes unemployment rates for the entire adult population and for 
more narrowly defined groups such as blacks, whites, men, women, and so on.
The BLS uses the same survey to produce data on labor-force participation. The 
labor‑force participation rate measures the percentage of the total adult popula-
tion of the United States that is in the labor force:

This statistic tells us the fraction of the population that has chosen to participate in 
the labor market. The labor-force participation rate, like the unemployment rate, 
is computed for both the entire adult population and more specific groups.
To see how these data are computed, consider the figures for 2009. In that year, 
139.9 million people were employed, and 14.3 million people were unemployed. 
The labor force was
Labor force = 139.9 + 14.3 = 154.2 million.
The unemployment rate was
Unemployment rate = (14.3 / 154.2) × 100 = 9.3 percent.
Because the adult population was 235.9 million, the labor‑force participation rate 
was
Labor‑force participation rate = (154.2 / 235.9) × 100 = 65.4 percent.
Hence, in 2009, almost two‑thirds of the U.S. adult population were participat-
ing in the labor market, and 9.3 percent of those labor-market participants were 
without work.
Table 1 shows the statistics on unemployment and labor-force participation for 
various groups within the U.S. population. Three comparisons are most appar-
ent. First, women ages 20 and older have lower rates of labor-force participation 
than men, but once in the labor force, women have somewhat lower rates of 
unemployment. Second, blacks ages 20 and older have similar rates of labor-force 
participation as whites, but they have much higher rates of unemployment. Third, 
teenagers have lower rates of labor-force participation and much higher rates of 
unemployment than older workers. More generally, these data show that labor-
market experiences vary widely among groups within the economy.
The BLS data on the labor market also allow economists and policymakers to 
monitor changes in the economy over time. Figure 2 shows the unemployment rate 
in the United States since 1960. The figure shows that the economy always has some 
unemployment and that the amount changes from year to year. The normal rate 
of unemployment around which the unemployment rate fluctuates is called the 
natural rate of unemployment, and the deviation of unemployment from its natural 
natural rate of 
unemployment
the normal rate of 
unemployment around 
which the unemployment 
rate fluctuates

rate is called cyclical unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment shown in 
the figure is a series estimated by economists at the Congressional Budget Office. 
For 2009, they estimated a natural rate of 5.0 percent, far below the actual unem-
ployment rate of 9.3 percent. Later in this book, we discuss short-run economic 
fluctuations, including the year-to-year fluctuations in unemployment around its 
natural rate. In the rest of this chapter, however, we ignore the short-run fluctua-
tions and examine why there is always some unemployment in market economies.
Labor-Force Participation of Men and  
Women in the U.S. Economy
Women’s role in American society has changed dramatically over the past 
century. Social commentators have pointed to many causes for this change. In 
part, it is attributable to new technologies, such as the washing machine, clothes 
dryer, refrigerator, freezer, and dishwasher, which have reduced the amount of 
time required to complete routine household tasks. In part, it is attributable to 
improved birth control, which has reduced the number of children born to the 
typical family. This change in women’s role is also partly attributable to chang-
ing political and social attitudes, which in turn may have been facilitated by the 
advances in technology and birth control. Together these developments have had 
a profound impact on society in general and on the economy in particular.
	
Nowhere is that impact more obvious than in data on labor-force participa-
tion. Figure 3 shows the labor-force participation rates of men and women in the

United States since 1950. Just after World War II, men and women had very differ-
ent roles in society. Only 33 percent of women were working or looking for work, 
in contrast to 87 percent of men. Over the past several decades, the difference 
between the participation rates of men and women has gradually diminished, as 
growing numbers of women have entered the labor force and some men have left 
it. Data for 2009 show that 59 percent of women were in the labor force, in contrast 
to 72 percent of men. As measured by labor-force participation, men and women 
are now playing a more equal role in the economy.
	
The increase in women’s labor-force participation is easy to understand, but 
the fall in men’s may seem puzzling. There are several reasons for this decline. 
First, young men now stay in school longer than their fathers and grandfathers 
did. Second, older men now retire earlier and live longer. Third, with more 
women employed, more fathers now stay at home to raise their children. Full-
time students, retirees, and stay-at-home dads are all counted as being out of the 
labor force.  ■
Does the Unemployment Rate Measure  
What We Want It To?
Measuring the amount of unemployment in the economy might seem a straightfor-
ward task, but it is not. While it is easy to distinguish between a person with a full-
time job and a person who is not working at all, it is much harder to distinguish 
between a person who is unemployed and a person who is not in the labor force.

Movements into and out of the labor force are, in fact, common. More than 
one‑third of the unemployed are recent entrants into the labor force. These 
entrants include young workers looking for their first jobs. They also include, in 
greater numbers, older workers who had previously left the labor force but have 
now returned to look for work. Moreover, not all unemployment ends with the 
job seeker finding a job. Almost half of all spells of unemployment end when the 
unemployed person leaves the labor force.
Because people move into and out of the labor force so often, statistics on 
unemployment are difficult to interpret. On the one hand, some of those who 
report being unemployed may not, in fact, be trying hard to find a job. They may 
be calling themselves unemployed because they want to qualify for a government 
program that financially assists the unemployed or because they are actually 
working but paid “under the table” to avoid taxes on their earnings. It may be 
more realistic to view these individuals as out of the labor force or, in some cases, 
employed. On the other hand, some of those who report being out of the labor 
force may want to work. These individuals may have tried to find a job and may 
have given up after an unsuccessful search. Such individuals, called discouraged 
workers, do not show up in unemployment statistics, even though they are truly 
workers without jobs. 
Because of these and other problems, the BLS calculates several other 
measures of labor underutilization, in addition to the official unemployment 
rate. These alternative measures are presented in Table 2. In the end, it is best 
to view the official unemployment rate as a useful but imperfect measure of 
joblessness.

How Long Are the Unemployed without Work?
In judging how serious the problem of unemployment is, one question to con-
sider is whether unemployment is typically a short-term or long-term condition. 
If unemployment is short term, one might conclude that it is not a big problem. 
Workers may require a few weeks between jobs to find the openings that best suit 
their tastes and skills. Yet if unemployment is long term, one might conclude that 
it is a serious problem. Workers unemployed for many months are more likely to 
suffer economic and psychological hardship. 
Because the duration of unemployment can affect our view about how big a 
problem unemployment is, economists have devoted much energy to studying 
data on the duration of unemployment spells. In this work, they have uncov-
ered a result that is important, subtle, and seemingly contradictory: Most spells 
of unemployment are short, and most unemployment observed at any given time is 
long-term.
To see how this statement can be true, consider an example. Suppose that you 
visited the government’s unemployment office every week for a year to survey 
the unemployed. Each week you find that there are four unemployed workers. 
Three of these workers are the same individuals for the whole year, while the 
fourth person changes every week. Based on this experience, would you say that 
unemployment is typically short-term or long-term?
Some simple calculations help answer this question. In this example, you 
meet a total of 55 unemployed people over the course of a year; 52 of them are 
unemployed for one week, and 3 are unemployed for the full year. This means 
that 52/55, or 95 percent, of unemployment spells end in one week. Yet whenever 
you walk into the unemployment office, three of the four people you meet will 
be unemployed for the entire year. So, even though 95 percent of unemployment 
spells end in one week, 75 percent of the unemployment observed at any moment 
is attributable to those individuals who are unemployed for a full year. In this 
example, as in the world, most spells of unemployment are short, and most unem-
ployment observed at any given time is long-term.
This subtle conclusion implies that economists and policymakers must be care-
ful when interpreting data on unemployment and when designing policies to help 
the unemployed. Most people who become unemployed will soon find jobs. Yet 
most of the economy’s unemployment problem is attributable to the relatively 
few workers who are jobless for long periods of time.
Why Are There Always Some People Unemployed?
We have discussed how the government measures the amount of unemployment, 
the problems that arise in interpreting unemployment statistics, and the findings 
of labor economists on the duration of unemployment. You should now have a 
good idea about what unemployment is.
This discussion, however, has not explained why economies experience 
unemployment. In most markets in the economy, prices adjust to bring quantity 
supplied and quantity demanded into balance. In an ideal labor market, wages 
would adjust to balance the quantity of labor supplied and the quantity of labor 
demanded. This adjustment of wages would ensure that all workers are always 
fully employed.
Of course, reality does not resemble this ideal. There are always some workers 
without jobs, even when the overall economy is doing well. In other words, the

 The Rise of Long-Term Unemployment
During the economic downturn of 2008 and 2009, the number of long-
term unemployed reached historic highs.

Chronic  
Joblessness  
Bites Deep 
By Sara Murray
R
ichard Moran, sitting in his garage in 
Ortonville, Mich., Tuesday, has been 
unemployed for two-and-a-half years after 
losing his job with Chrysler.
	
The job market is improving, but one 
statistic presents a stark reminder of the 
challenges that remain: Nearly half of the 
unemployed—45.9%—have been out of 
work longer than six months, more than at 
any time since the Labor Department began 
keeping track in 1948.
	
Even in the worst months of the early 
1980s, when the jobless rate topped 10% 
for months on end, only about one in four 
of the unemployed was out of work for more 
than six months.
	
Overall, seven million Americans have 
been looking for work for 27 weeks or more, 
and most of them—4.7 million—have been 
out of work for a year or more. 
	
Long-term unemployment has reached 
nearly every segment of the population, but 
some have been particularly hard-hit. The 
typical long-term unemployed worker is a 
white man with a high-school education or 
less. Older unemployed workers also tend to 
be out of work longer. Those between ages 
65 and 69 who still wish to work have typi-
cally been jobless for 49.8 weeks. 
	
The effects of long-term unemployment 
are likely to linger when the overall job-
less rate falls toward normal, threatening 
to create a pool of nearly permanently 
unemployed workers, a condition once more 
common in Europe than in the U.S. 
	
“The consequences are worse for those 
who can’t find a job quickly,” said Till 
Marco von Wachter, a Columbia University 
economist. They extend from atrophying 
skills to a higher likelihood of unhappi-
ness and anxiety. Workers out of work for 
a long time tend to find it more difficult 
to find a job, and “the longer people are 
unemployed the more likely they are to 
eventually give up searching and thereby 
drop out of the labor force,” Mr. von 
Wachter said.

unemployment rate never falls to zero; instead, it fluctuates around the natural 
rate of unemployment. To understand this natural rate, the remaining sections of 
this chapter examine the reasons actual labor markets depart from the ideal of full 
employment.
To preview our conclusions, we will find that there are four ways to explain 
unemployment in the long run. The first explanation is that it takes time for 
workers to search for the jobs that are best suited for them. The unemployment 
that results from the process of matching workers and jobs is sometimes called 
frictional unemployment, and it is often thought to explain relatively short spells 
of unemployment.
The next three explanations for unemployment suggest that the number 
of jobs available in some labor markets may be insufficient to give a job to 
everyone who wants one. This occurs when the quantity of labor supplied 
exceeds the quantity demanded. Unemployment of this sort is sometimes called 
frictional 
unemployment

structural unemployment, and it is often thought to explain longer spells of 
unemployment. As we will see, this kind of unemployment results when wages 
are, for some reason, set above the level that brings supply and demand into 
equilibrium. We will examine three possible reasons for an above-equilibrium 
wage: minimum-wage laws, unions, and efficiency wages. 
Quick Quiz  How is the unemployment rate measured? • How might the unemploy-
ment rate overstate the amount of joblessness? How might it understate the amount 
of joblessness?
Job Search
One reason economies always experience some unemployment is job search. Job 
search is the process of matching workers with appropriate jobs. If all workers 
and all jobs were the same, so that all workers were equally well suited for all 
jobs, job search would not be a problem. Laid‑off workers would quickly find new 
jobs that were well suited for them. But in fact, workers differ in their tastes and 
skills, jobs differ in their attributes, and information about job candidates and job 
vacancies is disseminated slowly among the many firms and households in the 
economy.

FYI
 The Jobs Number
W
hen the Bureau of Labor Statistics announces the unemploy-
ment rate at the beginning of every month, it also announces 
the number of jobs the economy has gained or lost. As an indicator 
of short-run economic trends, the jobs number gets as much atten-
tion as the unemployment rate.
	
Where does the jobs number come from? You might guess that 
it comes from the same survey of 60,000 households that yields the 
unemployment rate. And indeed the household survey does produce 
data on total employment. The jobs number that gets the most 
attention, however, comes from a separate survey of 160,000 busi-
ness establishments, which have over 40 million workers on their 
payrolls. The results from the establishment survey are announced 
at the same time as the results from the household survey.
	
Both surveys yield information about total employment, but 
the results are not always the same. One reason is that the 
establishment survey has a larger sample, which makes it more 
reliable. Another reason is that the surveys are not measuring 
exactly the same thing. For example, a person who has two 
part-time jobs in different companies would be counted as one 
employed person in the household survey but as two jobs in the 
establishment survey. As another example, a person running his 
own small business would be counted as employed in the house-
hold survey but would not show up at all in the establishment 
survey, because the establishment survey counts only employees 
on a business payroll.
	
The establishment survey is closely watched for its data on jobs, 
but it says nothing about unemployment. To measure the number of 
unemployed, we need to know how many people without jobs are 
trying to find them. The household survey is the only source of that 
information.

Why Some Frictional Unemployment Is Inevitable
Frictional unemployment is often the result of changes in the demand for labor 
among different firms. When consumers decide that they prefer Dell to Apple 
computers, Dell increases employment, and Apple lays off workers. The former 
Apple workers must now search for new jobs, and Dell must decide which new 
workers to hire for the various jobs that have opened up. The result of this transi-
tion is a period of unemployment.
Similarly, because different regions of the country produce different goods, 
employment can rise in one region while falling in another. Consider, for instance, 
what happens when the world price of oil falls. Oil‑producing firms in Alaska 
respond to the lower price by cutting back on production and employment. At 
the same time, cheaper gasoline stimulates car sales, so auto‑producing firms in 
Michigan raise production and employment. Just the opposite happens when the 
world price of oil rises. Changes in the composition of demand among industries 
or regions are called sectoral shifts. Because it takes time for workers to search for 
jobs in the new sectors, sectoral shifts temporarily cause unemployment.
Frictional unemployment is inevitable simply because the economy is always 
changing. A century ago, the four industries with the largest employment in the 
United States were cotton goods, woolen goods, men’s clothing, and lumber. 
Today, the four largest industries are autos, aircraft, communications, and electri-
cal components. As this transition took place, jobs were created in some firms and 
destroyed in others. The result of this process has been higher productivity and 
higher living standards. But along the way, workers in declining industries found 
themselves out of work and searching for new jobs. 
Data show that at least 10 percent of U.S. manufacturing jobs are destroyed every 
year. In addition, more than 3 percent of workers leave their jobs in a typical month, 
sometimes because they realize that the jobs are not a good match for their tastes 
and skills. Many of these workers, especially younger ones, find new jobs at higher 
wages. This churning of the labor force is normal in a well-functioning and dynamic 
market economy, but the result is some amount of frictional unemployment.
Public Policy and Job Search
Even if some frictional unemployment is inevitable, the precise amount is not. The 
faster information spreads about job openings and worker availability, the more 
rapidly the economy can match workers and firms. The Internet, for instance, may 
help facilitate job search and reduce frictional unemployment. In addition, public 
policy may play a role. If policy can reduce the time it takes unemployed workers 
to find new jobs, it can reduce the economy’s natural rate of unemployment.
Government programs try to facilitate job search in various ways. One way 
is through government-run employment agencies, which give out information 
about job vacancies. Another way is through public training programs, which 
aim to ease workers’ transition from declining to growing industries and to help 
disadvantaged groups escape poverty. Advocates of these programs believe that 
they make the economy operate more efficiently by keeping the labor force more 
fully employed and that they reduce the inequities inherent in a constantly chang-
ing market economy.
Critics of these programs question whether the government should get 
involved with the process of job search. They argue that it is better to let the pri-
vate market match workers and jobs. In fact, most job search in our economy takes 
place without intervention by the government. Newspaper ads, Internet job sites,

college placement offices, headhunters, and word of mouth all help spread infor-
mation about job openings and job candidates. Similarly, much worker education 
is done privately, either through schools or through on-the-job training. These 
critics contend that the government is no better—and most likely worse—at dis-
seminating the right information to the right workers and deciding what kinds of 
worker training would be most valuable. They claim that these decisions are best 
made privately by workers and employers. 
Unemployment Insurance

Long Recession 
Ignites Debate on 
Jobless Benefits 
By Sara Murray 
M
anagement Recruiters of Sacramento, 
Calif., says it recently had a tough time 
filling six engineering positions at an Oregon 
manufacturer paying $60,000 a year— 
and suspects long-term jobless benefits 
were part of the hitch.
	
“We called several engineers that were 
unemployed,” says Karl Dinse, a managing 
partner at the recruiting firm. “They said, 
nah, you know, if it were paying $80,000 I’d 
think about it.” Some candidates suggested 
he call them back when their benefits were 
scheduled to run out, he says.
	
Rick Jewell has a different take on 
extended jobless benefits: He didn’t want 
to be on the dole, but had no alternative. 
He has been out of work since he lost his 
$12-an-hour job driving a forklift for a 
cosmetics company in Greenwood, Ind., in 
December 2008. He collected $315 a week 
in benefits until early June—when Congress 
declined to renew the law that gave workers 
in Indiana and some other states up to 99 
weeks of assistance. 
	
“I am tired of sitting at home. I am 
tired  of not being the breadwinner,” says 
Mr. Jewell, who says he looks for work every 
day. He and his wife now rely on her $480 a 
week job as a distribution supervisor at the 
same cosmetics company. 
	
In the long recession and the lackluster 
recovery, the government expanded unem-
ployment payments more than at any time 
since the benefits were rolled out in the 
1930s. And workers have gone jobless for 
longer than any time since official tallies 
began in 1967.
	
Politicians and economists are now in 
a fierce debate that could have big conse-
quences for the jobless: Did more-generous 
unemployment benefits prompt jobless 
workers to be pickier in their searches? Or 
was the program a prudent response to the 
worst recession in generations? . . . 
	
Economists have argued for years about 
the extent to which government benefits 
prolong unemployment—and possibly aug-
ment the overall jobless rate. Most believe 
that expanding benefits does discourage 
some unemployed people from looking for 
work or taking available jobs. But they 
disagree on how acute that effect is, par-
ticularly at a time when jobs are scarce. 
 How Much Do the Unemployed 
Respond to Incentives?
During the economic downturn of 2008 and 2009, economists and 
policymakers wrestled with the question of how much the unemployment-
insurance system was affecting the behavior of unemployed workers.

“Given the current economic situation I 
doubt that effect is very large,” says Harvard 
University economist Raj Chetty. “I think 
people will take whatever job they can get.”
	
Economists on the right see a danger 
to prolonging benefits. “I don’t think any-
body’s getting rich off of unemployment, 
and I’m not saying people are lazy,” says 
Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute, a 
libertarian think tank in Washington, D.C. 
“The fact is, when you have a check coming 
in, even if it’s a fairly low check, you’re less 
motivated to either look for work or accept 
less optimal jobs.” 
	
The recent recession was unusual in 
almost every respect. Compared to other 
post-World War II recessions, it was deeper, 
longer and put more people out of work. 
A year after the economy began growing, 
unemployment is still a very high 9.5%. 
Nearly half the jobless—6.8 million total—
have been out of work for more than six 
months, and 4.3 million of those have been 
without work for more than a year. The typi-
cal unemployed person has been out of the 
job market for a median of 25.5 weeks. 
	
The government response was also 
unusual, and not just in the big bank bail-
out. In normal times, the unemployed are 
offered up to 26 weeks of benefits, largely 
financed by a tax on employers. In reces-
sions, state and federal governments often 
jointly finance up to an additional 20 weeks 
in hard-hit states. In this recession, Congress 
added up to another 53 weeks of federally 
funded benefits; in the deep crisis of the 
1980s, the maximum total never exceeded 
55 weeks. 
	
The unemployment compensation sys-
tem, created in 1935, was designed to tide 
workers over during periods of temporary 
unemployment. Benefits are based on a 
worker’s prior wages; the average is $310 
a week. Only workers who have lost a job 
through no fault of their own are eligible. 
Those who quit or who are new to the 
work force don’t qualify. They must reapply 
weekly or biweekly, depending on the state, 
and indicate that they are looking for work. 
	
In the 1980s, only half of all unemployed 
received benefits. In the first quarter of 
2010, 69% of the unemployed did. That’s 
partly because the benefits lasted so much 
longer, economists say. It’s also because 
Washington gave states incentives to extend 
benefits to workers looking for part-time jobs 
and those who enrolled in training programs.
	
A variety of studies suggest that add-
ing another 53 weeks of benefits increases 
the time the average worker is jobless by 
between 4.2 and 10.6 weeks. The higher 
estimates are based on studies conducted 
decades ago when layoffs were often tem-
porary; in this recession, many unemployed 
workers will never return to their old posi-
tions. . . . In a recession such as this one—
with five unemployed workers for every job 
opening—it’s not clear whether the old 
academic findings apply.
	
In his scholarly past, Lawrence Summers, 
now Mr. Obama’s economic guru, wrote in 
1993 that “government assistance pro-
grams contribute to long-term unemploy-
ment . . . by providing an incentive, and 
the means, not to work.” When an April 
Wall Street Journal editorial described his 
position, Mr. Summers fired back in a letter 
to the editor: “In the wake of the worst eco-
nomic crisis in eight decades . . . there can 
be no doubt that the overwhelming cause of 
unemployment is economic distress, not the 
existence of unemployment insurance.”

who quit their jobs, were fired for cause, or just entered the labor force are not 
eligible. Benefits are paid only to the unemployed who were laid off because 
their previous employers no longer needed their skills. The terms of the program 
vary over time and across states, but a typical worker covered by unemployment 
insurance in the United States receives 50 percent of his or her former wages for 
twenty-six weeks. 
While unemployment insurance reduces the hardship of unemployment, it 
also increases the amount of unemployment. The explanation is based on one of 
the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1: People respond to incentives. Because 
unemployment benefits stop when a worker takes a new job, the unemployed 
devote less effort to job search and are more likely to turn down unattractive 
job offers. In addition, because unemployment insurance makes unemployment

less onerous, workers are less likely to seek guarantees of job security when they 
negotiate with employers over the terms of employment.
Many studies by labor economists have examined the incentive effects of 
unemployment insurance. One study examined an experiment run by the state 
of Illinois in 1985. When unemployed workers applied to collect unemployment 
insurance benefits, the state randomly selected some of them and offered each 
a $500 bonus if they found new jobs within eleven weeks. This group was then 
compared to a control group not offered the incentive. The average spell of unem-
ployment for the group offered the bonus was 7 percent shorter than the average 
spell for the control group. This experiment shows that the design of the unem-
ployment insurance system influences the effort that the unemployed devote to 
job search.
Several other studies examined search effort by following a group of workers 
over time. Unemployment insurance benefits, rather than lasting forever, usually 
run out after six months or one year. These studies found that when the unem-
ployed become ineligible for benefits, the probability of their finding a new job 
rises markedly. Thus, receiving unemployment insurance benefits does reduce 
the search effort of the unemployed.
Even though unemployment insurance reduces search effort and raises unem-
ployment, we should not necessarily conclude that the policy is bad. The program 
does achieve its primary goal of reducing the income uncertainty that workers 
face. In addition, when workers turn down unattractive job offers, they have the 
opportunity to look for jobs that better suit their tastes and skills. Some econo-
mists argue that unemployment insurance improves the ability of the economy to 
match each worker with the most appropriate job.
The study of unemployment insurance shows that the unemployment rate is an 
imperfect measure of a nation’s overall level of economic well-being. Most econo-
mists agree that eliminating unemployment insurance would reduce the amount 
of unemployment in the economy. Yet economists disagree on whether economic 
well-being would be enhanced or diminished by this change in policy.

Minimum-Wage Laws
Having seen how frictional unemployment results from the process of matching 
workers and jobs, let’s now examine how structural unemployment results when 
the number of jobs is insufficient for the number of workers. 
To understand structural unemployment, we begin by reviewing how minimum-
wage laws can cause unemployment. Although minimum wages are not the pre-
dominant reason for unemployment in our economy, they have an important effect 
on certain groups with particularly high unemployment rates. Moreover, the analysis 
of minimum wages is a natural place to start because, as we will see, it can be used 
to understand some of the other reasons for structural unemployment.
Figure 4 reviews the basic economics of a minimum wage. When a minimum-wage 
law forces the wage to remain above the level that balances supply and demand, it 
raises the quantity of labor supplied and reduces the quantity of labor demanded

compared to the equilibrium level. There is a surplus of labor. Because there are more 
workers willing to work than there are jobs, some workers are unemployed.
While minimum-wage laws are one reason unemployment exists in the U.S. 
economy, they do not affect everyone. The vast majority of workers have wages 
well above the legal minimum, so the law does not prevent most wages from 
adjusting to balance supply and demand. Minimum-wage laws matter most for 
the least skilled and least experienced members of the labor force, such as teen­
agers. Their equilibrium wages tend to be low and, therefore, are more likely to 
fall below the legal minimum. It is only among these workers that minimum-
wage laws explain the existence of unemployment.
Figure 4 is drawn to show the effects of a minimum-wage law, but it also 
illustrates a more general lesson: If the wage is kept above the equilibrium level for any 
reason, the result is unemployment. Minimum-wage laws are just one reason wages 
may be “too high.” In the remaining two sections of this chapter, we consider 
two other reasons wages may be kept above the equilibrium level: unions and 
efficiency wages. The basic economics of unemployment in these cases is the same 
as that shown in Figure 4, but these explanations of unemployment can apply to 
many more of the economy’s workers.
At this point, however, we should stop and notice that the structural unem-
ployment that arises from an above-equilibrium wage is, in an important sense, 
different from the frictional unemployment that arises from the process of job 
search. The need for job search is not due to the failure of wages to balance labor 
supply and labor demand. When job search is the explanation for unemployment, 
workers are searching for the jobs that best suit their tastes and skills. By contrast, 
when the wage is above the equilibrium level, the quantity of labor supplied 
exceeds the quantity of labor demanded, and workers are unemployed because 
they are waiting for jobs to open up. 
Unemployment from a Wage 
above the Equilibrium Level
In this labor market, the 
wage at which supply and 
demand balance is WE. At this 
equilibrium wage, the quantity 
of labor supplied and the 
quantity of labor demanded 
both equal LE. By contrast, if 
the wage is forced to remain 
above the equilibrium level, 
perhaps because of a minimum-
wage law, the quantity of labor 
supplied rises to LS, and the 
quantity of labor demanded 
falls to LD. The resulting surplus 
of labor, LS – LD, represents 
unemployment.

Unions and Collective Bargaining
A union is a worker association that bargains with employers over wages, ben-
efits, and working conditions. Only 12 percent of U.S. workers now belong to 
unions, but unions played a much larger role in the U.S. labor market in the past. 
In the 1940s and 1950s, when union membership was at its peak, about a third of 
the U.S. labor force was unionized.
Moreover, for a variety of historical reasons, unions continue to play a large 
role in many European countries. In Belgium, Norway, and Sweden, for instance, 
more than half of workers belong to unions. In France and Germany, a majority 
of workers have wages set by collective bargaining by law, even though only 
some of these workers are themselves union members. In these cases, wages are 
not determined by the equilibrium of supply and demand in competitive labor 
markets.

 Who Earns the Minimum Wage?
I
n 2010, the Department of Labor released a study of which work-
ers reported earnings at or below the minimum wage in 2009, 
when, in July, the minimum wage was raised from $6.55 to $7.25 
per hour. (A reported wage below the minimum is possible because 
some workers are exempt from the statute, because enforcement is 
imperfect, and because some workers round down when reporting 
their wages on surveys.) Here is a summary of the findings:
• Of those workers paid an hourly rate, about 4 percent of men 
and 6 percent of women reported wages at or below the prevail-
ing federal minimum.
• Minimum-wage workers tend to be young. About half of all 
hourly paid workers earning the minimum wage or less were 
under age 25, and about one-fourth were age 16–19. Among 
employed teenagers, 19 percent earned the minimum wage or 
less, compared with 3 percent of workers age 25 and older.
• Minimum-wage workers tend to be less educated. Among hourly 
paid workers age 16 and older, about 10 percent of those without 
a high school diploma earned the minimum wage or less, com-
pared with about 4 percent of those who earned a high school 
diploma (but did not attend college) and about 3 percent for 
those who had obtained a college degree.
• Minimum-wage workers are more likely to be working part time. 
Among part-time workers (those who usually work less than 35 
hours per week), 11 percent were paid the minimum wage or 
less, compared to 2 percent of full-time workers.
• The industry with the highest proportion of workers with reported 
hourly wages at or below the minimum wage was leisure and 
hospitality (21 percent). About one-half of all workers paid at 
or below the minimum wage were employed in this industry, 
primarily in food services and drinking establishments. For many 
of these workers, tips supplement the hourly wages received.
• The proportion of hourly paid workers earning the prevailing fed-
eral minimum wage or less has trended downward since 1979, 
when data collection first began on a regular basis.

The Economics of Unions
A union is a type of cartel. Like any cartel, a union is a group of sellers acting 
together in the hope of exerting their joint market power. Most workers in the 
U.S. economy discuss their wages, benefits, and working conditions with their 
employers as individuals. By contrast, workers in a union do so as a group. The 
process by which unions and firms agree on the terms of employment is called 
collective bargaining. 
When a union bargains with a firm, it asks for higher wages, better benefits, 
and better working conditions than the firm would offer in the absence of a union. 
If the union and the firm do not reach agreement, the union can organize a with-
drawal of labor from the firm, called a strike. Because a strike reduces production, 
sales, and profit, a firm facing a strike threat is likely to agree to pay higher wages 
than it otherwise would. Economists who study the effects of unions typically find 
that union workers earn about 10 to 20 percent more than similar workers who do 
not belong to unions.
When a union raises the wage above the equilibrium level, it raises the quan-
tity of labor supplied and reduces the quantity of labor demanded, resulting in 
unemployment. Workers who remain employed at the higher wage are better off, 
but those who were previously employed and are now unemployed are worse 
off. Indeed, unions are often thought to cause conflict between different groups of 
workers—between the insiders who benefit from high union wages and the outsid-
ers who do not get the union jobs.
The outsiders can respond to their status in one of two ways. Some of them 
remain unemployed and wait for the chance to become insiders and earn the 
high union wage. Others take jobs in firms that are not unionized. Thus, when 
unions raise wages in one part of the economy, the supply of labor increases in 
other parts of the economy. This increase in labor supply, in turn, reduces wages 
in industries that are not unionized. In other words, workers in unions reap the 
benefit of collective bargaining, while workers not in unions bear some of the cost. 
The role of unions in the economy depends in part on the laws that govern 
union organization and collective bargaining. Normally, explicit agreements 
among members of a cartel are illegal. When firms selling similar products agree 
to set high prices, the agreement is considered a “conspiracy in restraint of trade,” 
and the government prosecutes the firms in civil and criminal court for violating 
the antitrust laws. By contrast, unions are exempt from these laws. The policy-
makers who wrote the antitrust laws believed that workers needed greater market 
power as they bargained with employers. Indeed, various laws are designed to 
encourage the formation of unions. In particular, the Wagner Act of 1935 prevents 
employers from interfering when workers try to organize unions and requires 
employers to bargain with unions in good faith. The National Labor Relations 
Board (NLRB) is the government agency that enforces workers’ right to unionize.
Legislation affecting the market power of unions is a perennial topic of political 
debate. State lawmakers sometimes debate right-to-work laws, which give workers 
in a unionized firm the right to choose whether to join the union. In the absence 
of such laws, unions can insist during collective bargaining that firms make union 
membership a requirement for employment. At times, lawmakers in Washington 
have debated a proposed law that would prevent firms from hiring permanent 
replacements for workers who are on strike. This law would make strikes more 
costly for firms, thereby increasing the market power of unions. These and similar 
policy decisions will help determine the future of the union movement.

Are Unions Good or Bad for the Economy?
Economists disagree about whether unions are good or bad for the economy as a 
whole. Let’s consider both sides of the debate.
Critics argue that unions are merely a type of cartel. When unions raise wages 
above the level that would prevail in competitive markets, they reduce the quan-
tity of labor demanded, cause some workers to be unemployed, and reduce the 
wages in the rest of the economy. The resulting allocation of labor is, critics argue, 
both inefficient and inequitable. It is inefficient because high union wages reduce 
employment in unionized firms below the efficient, competitive level. It is inequi-
table because some workers benefit at the expense of other workers.
Advocates contend that unions are a necessary antidote to the market power 
of the firms that hire workers. The extreme case of this market power is the 
“company town,” where a single firm does most of the hiring in a geographical 
region. In a company town, if workers do not accept the wages and working con-
ditions that the firm offers, they have little choice but to move or stop working. 
In the absence of a union, therefore, the firm could use its market power to pay 
lower wages and offer worse working conditions than would prevail if it had to 
compete with other firms for the same workers. In this case, a union may balance 
the firm’s market power and protect the workers from being at the mercy of the 
firm’s owners.
Advocates of unions also claim that unions are important for helping firms 
respond efficiently to workers’ concerns. Whenever a worker takes a job, the 
worker and the firm must agree on many attributes of the job in addition to the 
wage: hours of work, overtime, vacations, sick leave, health benefits, promotion 
schedules, job security, and so on. By representing workers’ views on these issues, 
unions allow firms to provide the right mix of job attributes. Even if unions have 
the adverse effect of pushing wages above the equilibrium level and causing 
unemployment, they have the benefit of helping firms keep a happy and produc-
tive workforce. 
In the end, there is no consensus among economists about whether unions are 
good or bad for the economy. Like many institutions, their influence is probably 
beneficial in some circumstances and adverse in others. 
Quick Quiz  How does a union in the auto industry affect wages and employment 
at General Motors and Ford? How does it affect wages and employment in other 
industries?
The Theory of Efficiency Wages
A fourth reason economies always experience some unemployment—in addition 
to job search, minimum-wage laws, and unions—is suggested by the theory of 
efficiency wages. According to this theory, firms operate more efficiently if wages 
are above the equilibrium level. Therefore, it may be profitable for firms to keep 
wages high even in the presence of a surplus of labor.
In some ways, the unemployment that arises from efficiency wages is similar 
to the unemployment that arises from minimum-wage laws and unions. In all 
three cases, unemployment is the result of wages above the level that balances 
the quantity of labor supplied and the quantity of labor demanded. Yet there is 
also an important difference. Minimum-wage laws and unions prevent firms from 
lowering wages in the presence of a surplus of workers. Efficiency-wage theory

states that such a constraint on firms is unnecessary in many cases because firms 
may be better off keeping wages above the equilibrium level.
Why should firms want to keep wages high? This decision may seem odd 
at first, for wages are a large part of firms’ costs. Normally, we expect profit-
maximizing firms to want to keep costs—and therefore wages—as low as possi-
ble. The novel insight of efficiency-wage theory is that paying high wages might 
be profitable because they might raise the efficiency of a firm’s workers.
There are several types of efficiency-wage theory. Each type suggests a differ-
ent explanation for why firms may want to pay high wages. Let’s now consider 
four of these types.
Worker Health
The first and simplest type of efficiency-wage theory emphasizes the link between 
wages and worker health. Better paid workers eat a more nutritious diet, and 
workers who eat a better diet are healthier and more productive. A firm may find 
it more profitable to pay high wages and have healthy, productive workers than 
to pay lower wages and have less healthy, less productive workers.
This type of efficiency-wage theory can be relevant for explaining unemploy-
ment in less developed countries where inadequate nutrition can be a problem. In 
these countries, firms may fear that cutting wages would, in fact, adversely influ-
ence their workers’ health and productivity. In other words, nutrition concerns 
may explain why firms may maintain above-equilibrium wages despite a surplus 
of labor. Worker health concerns are far less relevant for firms in rich countries 
such as the United States, where the equilibrium wages for most workers are well 
above the level needed for an adequate diet.
Worker Turnover
A second type of efficiency-wage theory emphasizes the link between wages and 
worker turnover. Workers quit jobs for many reasons: to take jobs in other firms, 
to move to other parts of the country, to leave the labor force, and so on. The 
frequency with which they quit depends on the entire set of incentives they face, 
including the benefits of leaving and the benefits of staying. The more a firm pays 
its workers, the less often its workers will choose to leave. Thus, a firm can reduce 
turnover among its workers by paying them a high wage.
Why do firms care about turnover? The reason is that it is costly for firms to 
hire and train new workers. Moreover, even after they are trained, newly hired 
workers are not as productive as experienced workers. Firms with higher turn­
over, therefore, will tend to have higher production costs. Firms may find it profit-
able to pay wages above the equilibrium level to reduce worker turnover. 
Worker Quality
A third type of efficiency-wage theory emphasizes the link between wages and 
worker quality. All firms want workers who are talented, and they try to pick the best 
applicants to fill job openings. But because firms cannot perfectly gauge the quality 
of applicants, hiring has a degree of randomness to it. When a firm pays a high wage, 
it attracts a better pool of workers to apply for its jobs and thereby increases the 
quality of its workforce. If the firm responded to a surplus of labor by reducing the 
wage, the most competent applicants—who are more likely to have better alternative 
opportunities than less competent applicants—may choose not to apply. If this influ-
ence of the wage on worker quality is strong enough, it may be profitable for the firm 
to pay a wage above the level that balances supply and demand.

Worker Effort
A fourth and final type of efficiency-wage theory emphasizes the link between 
wages and worker effort. In many jobs, workers have some discretion over how 
hard to work. As a result, firms monitor the efforts of their workers, and work-
ers caught shirking their responsibilities are fired. But not all shirkers are caught 
immediately because monitoring workers is costly and imperfect. A firm in such 
a circumstance is always looking for ways to deter shirking.
One solution is paying wages above the equilibrium level. High wages make 
workers more eager to keep their jobs and, thereby, give workers an incentive to 
put forward their best effort. If the wage were at the level that balanced supply 
and demand, workers would have less reason to work hard because if they were 
fired, they could quickly find new jobs at the same wage. Therefore, firms raise 
wages above the equilibrium level, providing an incentive for workers not to 
shirk their responsibilities. 
Henry Ford and the Very Generous $5-a-Day Wage
Henry Ford was an industrial visionary. As founder of the Ford Motor Company, 
he was responsible for introducing modern techniques of production. Rather than 
building cars with small teams of skilled craftsmen, Ford built cars on assembly 
lines in which unskilled workers were taught to perform the same simple tasks 
over and over again. The output of this assembly process was the Model T Ford, 
one of the most famous early automobiles.
	
In 1914, Ford introduced another innovation: the $5 workday. This might not 
seem like much today, but back then $5 was about twice the going wage. It was 
also far above the wage that balanced supply and demand. When the new $5-a-
day wage was announced, long lines of job seekers formed outside the Ford facto-
ries. The number of workers willing to work at this wage far exceeded the number 
of workers Ford needed.
	
Ford’s high-wage policy had many of the effects predicted by efficiency-wage 
theory. Turnover fell, absenteeism fell, and productivity rose. Workers were 
so much more efficient that Ford’s production costs were lower despite higher 
wages. Thus, paying a wage above the equilibrium level was profitable for the 
firm. An historian of the early Ford Motor Company wrote, “Ford and his associ-
ates freely declared on many occasions that the high-wage policy turned out to 
be good business. By this they meant that it had improved the discipline of the 
workers, given them a more loyal interest in the institution, and raised their

personal efficiency.” Henry Ford himself called the $5-a-day wage “one of the 
finest cost-cutting moves we ever made.”
	
Why did it take Henry Ford to introduce this efficiency wage? Why were other 
firms not already taking advantage of this seemingly profitable business strategy? 
According to some analysts, Ford’s decision was closely linked to his use of the 
assembly line. Workers organized in an assembly line are highly interdependent. 
If one worker is absent or works slowly, other workers are less able to complete 
their own tasks. Thus, while assembly lines made production more efficient, they 
also raised the importance of low worker turnover, high worker effort, and high 
worker quality. As a result, paying efficiency wages may have been a better strat-
egy for the Ford Motor Company than for other businesses at the time.  ■

Conclusion
In this chapter, we discussed the measurement of unemployment and the reasons 
economies always experience some degree of unemployment. We have seen how job 
search, minimum-wage laws, unions, and efficiency wages can all help explain why 
some workers do not have jobs. Which of these four explanations for the natural rate 
of unemployment are the most important for the U.S. economy and other economies 
around the world? Unfortunately, there is no easy way to tell. Economists differ in 
which of these explanations of unemployment they consider most important.
The analysis of this chapter yields an important lesson: Although the economy 
will always have some unemployment, its natural rate does change over time. Many 
events and policies can alter the amount of unemployment the economy typically 
experiences. As the information revolution changes the process of job search, as 
Congress adjusts the minimum wage, as workers form or quit unions, and as firms 
change their reliance on efficiency wages, the natural rate of unemployment evolves. 
Unemployment is not a simple problem with a simple solution. But how we choose 
to organize our society can profoundly influence how prevalent a problem it is.
Summary
• 
The unemployment rate is the percentage of 
those who would like to work who do not have 
jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates 
this statistic monthly based on a survey of 
thousands of households.
• 
The unemployment rate is an imperfect measure 
of joblessness. Some people who call themselves 
unemployed may actually not want to work, and 
some people who would like to work have left 
the labor force after an unsuccessful search and 
therefore are not counted as unemployed.
• 
In the U.S. economy, most people who become 
unemployed find work within a short period of 
time. Nonetheless, most unemployment observed 
at any given time is attributable to the few people 
who are unemployed for long periods of time.
• 
One reason for unemployment is the time it takes 
workers to search for jobs that best suit their 
tastes and skills. This frictional unemployment is 
increased as a result of unemployment insurance, 
a government policy designed to protect workers’ 
incomes.

Key Concepts
Questions for Review
	 1.	 What are the three categories into which the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics divides everyone? 
How does the BLS compute the labor force, 
the unemployment rate, and the labor-force 
participation rate?
	 2.	 Is unemployment typically short term or long 
term? Explain.
	 3.	 Why is frictional unemployment inevitable? 
How might the government reduce the amount 
of frictional unemployment?
	 4.	 Are minimum-wage laws a better explanation 
for structural unemployment among teenagers 
or among college graduates? Why?
	 5.	 How do unions affect the natural rate of 
unemployment?
	 6.	 What claims do advocates of unions make to 
argue that unions are good for the economy?
	 7.	 Explain four ways in which a firm might 
increase its profits by raising the wages  
it pays.
Problems and Applications 
	 1.	 The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced 
that in April 2010, of all adult Americans, 
139,455,000 were employed, 15,260,000 were 
unemployed, and 82,614,000 were not in the 
labor force. Use this information to calculate:
a.	 the adult population 
b.	the labor force
c.	 the labor-force participation rate
d.	the unemployment rate
	 2.	 Go to the website of the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (http://www.bls.gov). What is the 
national unemployment rate right now? Find 
the unemployment rate for the demographic 
group that best fits a description of you  
(for example, based on age, sex, and race).  
Is it higher or lower than the national average? 
Why do you think this is so?
• 
A second reason our economy always has some 
unemployment is minimum-wage laws. By 
raising the wage of unskilled and inexperienced 
workers above the equilibrium level, minimum-
wage laws raise the quantity of labor supplied 
and reduce the quantity demanded. The resulting 
surplus of labor represents unemployment.
• 
A third reason for unemployment is the market 
power of unions. When unions push the wages 
in unionized industries above the equilibrium 
level, they create a surplus of labor. 
• 
A fourth reason for unemployment is suggested 
by the theory of efficiency wages. According 
to this theory, firms find it profitable to pay 
wages above the equilibrium level. High wages 
can improve worker health, lower worker 
turnover, raise worker quality, and increase 
worker effort.

	 3.	 Between 2004 and 2007, total U.S. employment 
increased by 6.8 million workers, but the 
number of unemployed workers declined 
by only 1.1 million. How are these numbers 
consistent with each other? Why might one 
expect a reduction in the number of people 
counted as unemployed to be smaller than the 
increase in the number of people employed?
	 4.	 Economists use labor-market data to evaluate 
how well an economy is using its most valuable 
resource—its people. Two closely watched 
statistics are the unemployment rate and the 
employment-population ratio. Explain what 
happens to each of these in the following 
scenarios. In your opinion, which statistic is 
the more meaningful gauge of how well the 
economy is doing?
a.	 An auto company goes bankrupt and lays off 
its workers, who immediately start looking 
for new jobs.
b.	After an unsuccessful search, some of the 
laid-off workers quit looking for new jobs.
c.	 Numerous students graduate from college 
but cannot find work.
d.	Numerous students graduate from college 
and immediately begin new jobs.
e.	 A stock market boom induces newly  
enriched 60-year-old workers to take early 
retirement.
f.	 Advances in healthcare prolong the life of 
many retirees.
	 5.	 Are the following workers more likely 
to experience short-term or long-term 
unemployment? Explain.
a.	 A construction worker laid off because of bad 
weather
b.	A manufacturing worker who loses her job at 
a plant in an isolated area
c.	 A stagecoach-industry worker laid off 
because of competition from railroads
d.	A short-order cook who loses his job when a 
new restaurant opens across the street
e.	 An expert welder with little formal education 
who loses her job when the company installs 
automatic welding machinery
	 6.	 Using a diagram of the labor market, show 
the effect of an increase in the minimum 
wage on the wage paid to workers, the 
number of workers supplied, the number 
of workers demanded, and the amount of 
unemployment.
	 7.	 Consider an economy with two labor markets—
one for manufacturing workers and one for 
service workers. Suppose initially that neither is 
unionized. 
a.	 If manufacturing workers formed a union, 
what impact on the wages and employment 
in manufacturing would you predict? 
b.	How would these changes in the 
manufacturing labor market affect the  
supply of labor in the market for service 
workers? What would happen to the 
equilibrium wage and employment in this 
labor market?
	 8.	 Structural unemployment is sometimes said 
to result from a mismatch between the job 
skills that employers want and the job skills 
that workers have. To explore this idea, 
consider an economy with two industries: auto 
manufacturing and aircraft manufacturing.
a.	 If workers in these two industries require 
similar amounts of training, and if workers 
at the beginning of their careers could choose 
which industry to train for, what would you 
expect to happen to the wages in these two 
industries? How long would this process 
take? Explain.
b.	Suppose that one day the economy opens 
itself to international trade and, as a result, 
starts importing autos and exporting aircraft. 
What would happen to demand for labor in 
these two industries?
c.	 Suppose that workers in one industry 
cannot be quickly retrained for the other. 
How would these shifts in demand affect 
equilibrium wages both in the short run and 
in the long run?
d.	If for some reason wages fail to adjust  
to the new equilibrium levels, what would 
occur? 
	 9.	 Suppose that Congress passes a law requiring 
employers to provide employees some benefit 
(such as healthcare) that raises the cost of an 
employee by $4 per hour. 
a.	 What effect does this employer mandate have 
on the demand for labor? (In answering this 
and the following questions, be quantitative 
when you can.)
b.	If employees place a value on this benefit 
exactly equal to its cost, what effect does this 
employer mandate have on the supply of 
labor?

c.	 If the wage is free to balance supply and 
demand, how does this law affect the wage 
and the level of employment? Are employers 
better or worse off? Are employees better or 
worse off?
d.	Suppose that, before the mandate, the 
wage in this market was $3 above the 
minimum wage. In this case, how does 
the employer mandate affect the wage, 
the level of employment, and the level of 
unemployment? 
e.	 Now suppose that workers do not value 
the mandated benefit at all. How does this 
alternative assumption change your answers 
to parts (b) and (c)?
