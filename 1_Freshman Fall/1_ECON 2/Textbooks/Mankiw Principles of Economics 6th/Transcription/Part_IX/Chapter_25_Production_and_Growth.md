Production and Growth
W
hen you travel around the world, you see tremendous variation in 
the standard of living. The average income in a rich country, such 
as the United States, Japan, or Germany, is more than ten times 
the average income in a poor country, such as India, Indonesia, or 
Nigeria. These large differences in income are reflected in large differences in 
the quality of life. People in richer countries have better nutrition, safer housing, 
better healthcare, and longer life expectancy as well as more automobiles, more 
telephones, and more televisions.
Even within a country, there are large changes in the standard of living over 
time. In the United States over the past century, average income as measured by real 
GDP per person has grown by about 2 percent per year. Although 2 percent might 
seem small, this rate of growth implies that average income doubles every 35 years. 
Because of this growth, average income today is about eight times the average income 
a century ago. As a result, the typical American enjoys much greater economic pros-
perity than did his or her parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents.

Growth rates vary substantially from country to country. In recent history, some 
East Asian countries, such as Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan, have experienced 
economic growth of about 7 percent per year; at this rate, average income doubles 
every 10 years. Over the past two decades, China has enjoyed an even higher rate of 
growth—about 12 percent per year, according to some estimates. A country experi-
encing such rapid growth can, in one generation, go from being among the poorest 
in the world to being among the richest. By contrast, in some African countries, such 
as Chad, Gabon, and Senegal, average income has been stagnant for many years.
What explains these diverse experiences? How can rich countries maintain their 
high standard of living? What policies should poor countries pursue to promote more 
rapid growth and join the developed world? These are among the most important 
questions in macroeconomics. As the Nobel-Prize-winning economist Robert Lucas 
put it, “The consequences for human welfare in questions like these are simply stag-
gering: Once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about anything else.”
In the previous two chapters, we discussed how economists measure macro­
economic quantities and prices. We can now begin to study the forces that deter-
mine these variables. As we have seen, an economy’s gross domestic product 
(GDP) measures both the total income earned in the economy and the total expen-
diture on the economy’s output of goods and services. The level of real GDP is a 
good gauge of economic prosperity, and the growth of real GDP is a good gauge 
of economic progress. In this chapter we focus on the long-run determinants of 
the level and growth of real GDP. Later in this book, we study the short-run fluc-
tuations of real GDP around its long-run trend.
We proceed here in three steps. First, we examine international data on real 
GDP per person. These data will give you some sense of how much the level and 
growth of living standards vary around the world. Second, we examine the role 
of productivity—the amount of goods and services produced for each hour of a 
worker’s time. In particular, we see that a nation’s standard of living is determined 
by the productivity of its workers, and we consider the factors that determine a 
nation’s productivity. Third, we consider the link between productivity and the 
economic policies that a nation pursues.
Economic Growth around the World
As a starting point for our study of long-run growth, let’s look at the experiences 
of some of the world’s economies. Table 1 shows data on real GDP per person for 
thirteen countries. For each country, the data cover more than a century of history. 
The first and second columns of the table present the countries and time periods. 
(The time periods differ somewhat from country to country because of differences 
in data availability.) The third and fourth columns show estimates of real GDP per 
person about a century ago and for a recent year.
The data on real GDP per person show that living standards vary widely from 
country to country. Income per person in the United States, for instance, is about 
eight times that in China and about sixteen times that in India. The poorest coun-
tries have average levels of income not seen in the developed world for many 
decades. The typical citizen of India in 2008 had less real income than the typical 
resident of England in 1870. The typical person in Bangladesh in 2008 had about 
two-thirds the real income of a typical American a century ago.
The last column of the table shows each country’s growth rate. The growth rate 
measures how rapidly real GDP per person grew in the typical year. In the United 
States, for example, where real GDP per person was $4,007 in 1870 and $46,970 in

2008, the growth rate was 1.80 percent per year. This means that if real GDP per 
person, beginning at $4,007, were to increase by 1.80 percent for each of 138 years, 
it would end up at $46,970. Of course, real GDP per person did not actually rise 
exactly 1.80 percent every year: Some years it rose by more, other years it rose by 
less, and in still other years it fell. The growth rate of 1.80 percent per year ignores 
short-run fluctuations around the long-run trend and represents an average rate 
of growth for real GDP per person over many years. 
The countries in Table 1 are ordered by their growth rate from the most to 
the least rapid. Japan tops the list, with a growth rate of 2.71 percent per year. 
A hundred years ago, Japan was not a rich country. Japan’s average income was 
only somewhat higher than Mexico’s, and it was well behind Argentina’s. The 
standard of living in Japan in 1890 was less than half of that in India today. But 
because of its spectacular growth, Japan is now an economic superpower, with 
average income more than twice that of Mexico and Argentina and similar to 
Germany, Canada, and the United Kingdom. At the bottom of the list of countries 
are Pakistan and Bangladesh, which have experienced growth of less than 1.3 
percent per year over the past century. As a result, the typical resident of these 
countries continues to live in abject poverty.
Because of differences in growth rates, the ranking of countries by income 
changes substantially over time. As we have seen, Japan is a country that has 
risen relative to others. One country that has fallen behind is the United Kingdom. 
In 1870, the United Kingdom was the richest country in the world, with average 
income about 20 percent higher than that of the United States and more than twice 
Canada’s. Today, average income in the United Kingdom is 20 percent below that 
of the United States and similar to Canada’s. 
These data show that the world’s richest countries have no guarantee they will stay 
the richest and that the world’s poorest countries are not doomed forever to remain 
in poverty. But what explains these changes over time? Why do some countries zoom 
ahead while others lag behind? These are precisely the questions that we take up next.

 A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Statistics
G
eorge Bernard Shaw once said, “The sign of a truly educated 
man is to be deeply moved by statistics.” Most of us, however, 
have trouble being deeply moved by data on GDP—until we see 
what these statistics represent. 
	
The three photos on these pages show a typical family from each 
of three countries—the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Mali. Each 
family was photographed outside their home, together with all their 
material possessions. 
	
These nations have very different standards of living, as judged 
by these photos, GDP, or other statistics. 
•  The United Kingdom is an advanced economy. In 2008, its GDP 
per person was $36,130. A negligible share of the population 
lives in extreme poverty, defined here as less than $2 a day. 
Educational attainment is high: Among children of high school 
age, 91 percent are in school. Residents of the United Kingdom 
can expect to enjoy a long life: The probability of a person 
surviving to age 65 is 85 percent for men and 91 percent for 
women.
•  Mexico is a middle-income country. In 2008, its GDP per 
­person was $14,270. About 5 percent of the population lives 
on less than $2 a day. Among children of high school age, 
71 percent are in school. The probability of a person surviving to 
age 65 is 78 percent for men and 86 percent for women.
•  Mali is a poor country. In 2008, its GDP per person was only 
$1,090. Extreme poverty is the norm: More than three-quarters 
of the population lives on less than $2 per day. Educational 
attainment in Mali is low: Among children of high school age, 
only 29 percent are in school. And life is often cut short: The 
probability of a person surviving to age 65 is only 38 percent for 
men and 42 percent for women.
Economists who study economic growth try to understand what 
causes such large differences in the standard of living.

Quick Quiz  What is the approximate growth rate of real GDP per person in the 
United States? Name a country that has had faster growth and a country that has had 
slower growth.
Productivity: Its Role and Determinants 
Explaining the large variation in living standards around the world is, in one 
sense, very easy. As we will see, the explanation can be summarized in a single 
word—productivity. But in another sense, the international variation is deeply 
puzzling. To explain why incomes are so much higher in some countries than in 
others, we must look at the many factors that determine a nation’s productivity.
Why Productivity Is So Important
Let’s begin our study of productivity and economic growth by developing a 
simple model based loosely on Daniel Defoe’s famous novel Robinson Crusoe 
about a sailor stranded on a desert island. Because Crusoe lives alone, he catches 
his own fish, grows his own vegetables, and makes his own clothes. We can think 
of Crusoe’s activities—his production and consumption of fish, vegetables, and 
clothing—as a simple economy. By examining Crusoe’s economy, we can learn 
some lessons that also apply to more complex and realistic economies.
FYI
 Are You Richer Than the Richest 
American?
A
merican Heritage magazine once published a list of the richest 
 Americans of all time. The number 1 spot went to John D. 
Rockefeller, the oil entrepreneur who lived from 1839 to 1937. 
According to the magazine’s calculations, his wealth would today be 
the equivalent of about $200 billion, almost four times that of Bill 
Gates, the software entrepreneur who is today’s richest American.
	
Despite his great wealth, Rockefeller did not enjoy many of the 
conveniences that we now take for granted. He 
couldn’t watch television, play video games, surf 
the Internet, or send e-mail. During the heat of 
summer, he couldn’t cool his home with air condi-
tioning. For much of his life, he couldn’t travel by 
car or plane, and he couldn’t use a telephone to 
call friends or family. If he became ill, he couldn’t 
take advantage of many medicines, such as anti-
biotics, that doctors today routinely use to prolong 
and enhance life.
	
Now consider: How much money would someone have to pay 
you to give up for the rest of your life all the modern conveniences 
that Rockefeller lived without? Would you do it for $200 billion? 
Perhaps not. And if you wouldn’t, is it fair to say that you are better 
off than John D. Rockefeller, allegedly the richest American ever?
	
The preceding chapter discussed how standard price indexes, 
which are used to compare sums of money from different points 
in time, fail to fully reflect the introduction of new 
goods in the economy. As a result, the rate of infla-
tion is overestimated. The flip side of this observa-
tion is that the rate of real economic growth is 
underestimated. Pondering Rockefeller’s life shows 
how significant this problem might be. Because of 
tremendous technological advances, the average 
American today is arguably “richer” than the richest 
American a century ago, even if that fact is lost in 
standard economic statistics.

What determines Crusoe’s standard of living? In a word, productivity, the 
quantity of goods and services produced from each unit of labor input. If Crusoe 
is good at catching fish, growing vegetables, and making clothes, he lives well. If 
he is bad at doing these things, he lives poorly. Because Crusoe gets to consume 
only what he produces, his living standard is tied to his productivity.
In the case of Crusoe’s economy, it is easy to see that productivity is the key deter-
minant of living standards and that growth in productivity is the key determinant 
of growth in living standards. The more fish Crusoe can catch per hour, the more 
he eats at dinner. If Crusoe finds a better place to catch fish, his productivity rises. 
This increase in productivity makes Crusoe better off: He can eat the extra fish, or he 
can spend less time fishing and devote more time to making other goods he enjoys.
Productivity’s key role in determining living standards is as true for nations as 
it is for stranded sailors. Recall that an economy’s gross domestic product (GDP) 
measures two things at once: the total income earned by everyone in the economy 
and the total expenditure on the economy’s output of goods and services. GDP can 
measure these two things simultaneously because, for the economy as a whole, 
they must be equal. Put simply, an economy’s income is the economy’s output. 
Like Crusoe, a nation can enjoy a high standard of living only if it can produce 
a large quantity of goods and services. Americans live better than Nigerians 
because American workers are more productive than Nigerian workers. The 
Japanese have enjoyed more rapid growth in living standards than Argentineans 
because Japanese workers have experienced more rapid growth in productivity. 
Indeed, one of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that a country’s stan-
dard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services.
Hence, to understand the large differences in living standards we observe 
across countries or over time, we must focus on the production of goods and 
services. But seeing the link between living standards and productivity is only 
the first step. It leads naturally to the next question: Why are some economies so 
much better at producing goods and services than others?
How Productivity Is Determined
Although productivity is uniquely important in determining Robinson Crusoe’s 
standard of living, many factors determine Crusoe’s productivity. Crusoe will 
be better at catching fish, for instance, if he has more fishing poles, if he has 
been trained in the best fishing techniques, if his island has a plentiful fish sup-
ply, or if he invents a better fishing lure. Each of these determinants of Crusoe’s 
productivity—which we can call physical capital, human capital, natural resources, 
and technological knowledge—has a counterpart in more complex and realistic 
economies. Let’s consider each factor in turn. 
Physical Capital per Worker  Workers are more productive if they have 
tools with which to work. The stock of equipment and structures used to produce 
goods and services is called physical capital, or just capital. For example, when 
woodworkers make furniture, they use saws, lathes, and drill presses. More tools 
allow the woodworkers to produce their output more quickly and more accurately: 
A worker with only basic hand tools can make less furniture each week than a 
worker with sophisticated and specialized woodworking equipment. 
As you may recall, the inputs used to produce goods and services—labor, capi-
tal, and so on—are called the factors of production. An important feature of capital 
is that it is a produced factor of production. That is, capital is an input into the pro-
duction process that in the past was an output from the production process. The 
productivity
the quantity of goods and 
services produced from 
each unit of labor input
physical capital
the stock of equipment 
and structures that are 
used to produce goods 
and services

woodworker uses a lathe to make the leg of a table. Earlier, the lathe itself was the 
output of a firm that manufactures lathes. The lathe manufacturer in turn used 
other equipment to make its product. Thus, capital is a factor of production used 
to produce all kinds of goods and services, including more capital.
Human Capital per Worker  A second determinant of productivity is human 
capital. Human capital is the economist’s term for the knowledge and skills that 
workers acquire through education, training, and experience. Human capital 
includes the skills accumulated in early childhood programs, grade school, high 
school, college, and on-the-job training for adults in the labor force. 
Education, training, and experience are less tangible than lathes, bulldozers, and 
buildings, but human capital is like physical capital in many ways. Like physical 
capital, human capital raises a nation’s ability to produce goods and services. Also 
like physical capital, human capital is a produced factor of production. Producing 
human capital requires inputs in the form of teachers, libraries, and student time. 
Indeed, students can be viewed as “workers” who have the important job of pro-
ducing the human capital that will be used in future production.
Natural Resources per Worker  A third determinant of productivity is 
natural resources. Natural resources are inputs into production that are provided 
by nature, such as land, rivers, and mineral deposits. Natural resources take 
two forms: renewable and nonrenewable. A forest is an example of a renewable 
resource. When one tree is cut down, a seedling can be planted in its place to be 
harvested in the future. Oil is an example of a nonrenewable resource. Because oil 
is produced by nature over many millions of years, there is only a limited supply. 
Once the supply of oil is depleted, it is impossible to create more.
Differences in natural resources are responsible for some of the differences in 
standards of living around the world. The historical success of the United States was 
driven in part by the large supply of land well suited for agriculture. Today, some 
countries in the Middle East, such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, are rich simply 
because they happen to be on top of some of the largest pools of oil in the world. 
Although natural resources can be important, they are not necessary for an 
economy to be highly productive in producing goods and services. Japan, for 
instance, is one of the richest countries in the world, despite having few natural 
resources. International trade makes Japan’s success possible. Japan imports 
many of the natural resources it needs, such as oil, and exports its manufactured 
goods to economies rich in natural resources.
Technological Knowledge  A fourth determinant of productivity is 
technological knowledge—the understanding of the best ways to produce goods 
and services. A hundred years ago, most Americans worked on farms because 
farm technology required a high input of labor to feed the entire population. 
Today, thanks to advances in farming technology, a small fraction of the popu-
lation can produce enough food to feed the entire country. This technological 
change made labor available to produce other goods and services.
Technological knowledge takes many forms. Some technology is common 
knowledge—after one person uses it, everyone becomes aware of it. For example, 
once Henry Ford successfully introduced production in assembly lines, other 
carmakers quickly followed suit. Other technology is proprietary—it is known 
only by the company that discovers it. Only the Coca-Cola Company, for instance, 
knows the secret recipe for making its famous soft drink. Still other technology 
is proprietary for a short time. When a pharmaceutical company discovers a new 
human capital
the knowledge and skills 
that workers acquire 
through education, 
training, and experience
natural resources
the inputs into the 
production of goods and 
services that are provided 
by nature, such as land, 
rivers, and mineral 
deposits
technological 
knowledge
society’s understanding of 
the best ways to produce 
goods and services

drug, the patent system gives that company a temporary right to be its exclusive 
manufacturer. When the patent expires, however, other companies are allowed to 
make the drug. All these forms of technological knowledge are important for the 
economy’s production of goods and services.
It is worthwhile to distinguish between technological knowledge and human 
capital. Although they are closely related, there is an important difference. 
Technological knowledge refers to society’s understanding about how the world 
works. Human capital refers to the resources expended transmitting this under-
standing to the labor force. To use a relevant metaphor, knowledge is the qual-
ity of society’s textbooks, whereas human capital is the amount of time that the 
population has devoted to reading them. Workers’ productivity depends on both.
Are Natural Resources a Limit to Growth?
Today, the world’s population is almost 7 billion, more than four times what it 
was a century ago. At the same time, many people are enjoying a much higher 
standard of living than did their great-grandparents. A perennial debate concerns 
whether this growth in population and living standards can continue in the future.
FYI
 The Production Function
E
conomists often use a production function to describe the rela-
tionship between the quantity of inputs used in production and 
the quantity of output from production. For example, suppose Y 
denotes the quantity of output, L the quantity of labor, K the quan-
tity of physical capital, H the quantity of human capital, and N the 
quantity of natural resources. Then we might write
Y = A F(L, K, H, N),
where F ( ) is a function that shows how the inputs are combined to 
produce output. A is a variable that reflects the available production 
technology. As technology improves, A rises, so the economy pro-
duces more output from any given combination of inputs.
	
Many production functions have a property called constant 
returns to scale. If a production function has constant returns to 
scale, then doubling all inputs causes the amount of output to 
double as well. Mathematically, we write that a production function 
has constant returns to scale if, for any positive number x,
xY = A F(xL, xK, xH, xN). 
A doubling of all inputs would be represented in this equation by 
x = 2. The right side shows the inputs doubling, and the left side 
shows output doubling.
	
Production functions with constant returns to scale have an 
interesting and useful implication. To see this implication, it will 
prove instructive to set x = 1/L. Then the preceding equation 
becomes
Y/L = A F(1, K/L, H/L, N/L).
Notice that Y/L is output per worker, which is a measure of produc-
tivity. This equation says that labor productivity depends on physical 
capital per worker (K/L), human capital per worker (H/L), and natural 
resources per worker (N/L). Productivity also depends on the state 
of technology, as reflected by the variable A. Thus, this equation 
provides a mathematical summary of the four determinants of pro-
ductivity we have just discussed.

Many commentators have argued that natural resources will eventually limit 
how much the world’s economies can grow. At first, this argument might seem 
hard to ignore. If the world has only a fixed supply of nonrenewable natural 
resources, how can population, production, and living standards continue to 
grow over time? Eventually, won’t supplies of oil and minerals start to run out? 
When these shortages start to occur, won’t they stop economic growth and, per-
haps, even force living standards to fall? 
	
Despite the apparent appeal of such arguments, most economists are less con-
cerned about such limits to growth than one might guess. They argue that techno-
logical progress often yields ways to avoid these limits. If we compare the economy 
today to the economy of the past, we see various ways in which the use of natural 
resources has improved. Modern cars have better gas mileage. New houses have 
better insulation and require less energy to heat and cool them. More efficient oil 
rigs waste less oil in the process of extraction. Recycling allows some nonrenewable 
resources to be reused. The development of alternative fuels, such as ethanol instead 
of gasoline, allows us to substitute renewable for nonrenewable resources.
	
Sixty years ago, some conservationists were concerned about the excessive use 
of tin and copper. At the time, these were crucial commodities: Tin was used to 
make many food containers, and copper was used to make telephone wire. Some 
people advocated mandatory recycling and rationing of tin and copper so that 
supplies would be available for future generations. Today, however, plastic has 
replaced tin as a material for making many food containers, and phone calls often 
travel over fiber-optic cables, which are made from sand. Technological progress 
has made once crucial natural resources less necessary.
	
But are all these efforts enough to permit continued economic growth? One 
way to answer this question is to look at the prices of natural resources. In a 
market economy, scarcity is reflected in market prices. If the world were running 
out of natural resources, then the prices of those resources would be rising over 
time. But in fact, the opposite is more often true. Natural resource prices exhibit 
substantial short-run fluctuations, but over long spans of time, the prices of most 
natural resources (adjusted for overall inflation) are stable or falling. It appears 
that our ability to conserve these resources is growing more rapidly than their 
supplies are dwindling. Market prices give no reason to believe that natural 
resources are a limit to economic growth.  ■
Quick Quiz  List and describe four determinants of a country’s productivity.
Economic Growth and Public Policy
So far, we have determined that a society’s standard of living depends on its 
ability to produce goods and services and that its productivity in turn depends 
on physical capital per worker, human capital per worker, natural resources per 
worker, and technological knowledge. Let’s now turn to the question faced by 
policymakers around the world: What can government policy do to raise produc-
tivity and living standards?
Saving and Investment
Because capital is a produced factor of production, a society can change the 
amount of capital it has. If today the economy produces a large quantity of new

capital goods, then tomorrow it will have a larger stock of capital and be able to 
produce more goods and services. Thus, one way to raise future productivity is to 
invest more current resources in the production of capital.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics presented in Chapter 1 is that people face 
trade-offs. This principle is especially important when considering the accumula-
tion of capital. Because resources are scarce, devoting more resources to produc-
ing capital requires devoting fewer resources to producing goods and services for 
current consumption. That is, for society to invest more in capital, it must con-
sume less and save more of its current income. The growth that arises from capital 
accumulation is not a free lunch: It requires that society sacrifice consumption of 
goods and services in the present to enjoy higher consumption in the future. 
The next chapter examines in more detail how the economy’s financial markets 
coordinate saving and investment. It also examines how government policies 
influence the amount of saving and investment that takes place. At this point, 
it is important to note that encouraging saving and investment is one way that 
a government can encourage growth and, in the long run, raise the economy’s 
standard of living. 
Diminishing Returns and the Catch-Up Effect
Suppose that a government pursues policies that raise the nation’s saving 
rate—the percentage of GDP devoted to saving rather than consumption. What 
happens? With the nation saving more, fewer resources are needed to make con-
sumption goods, and more resources are available to make capital goods. As a 
result, the capital stock increases, leading to rising productivity and more rapid 
growth in GDP. But how long does this higher rate of growth last? Assuming that 
the saving rate remains at its new higher level, does the growth rate of GDP stay 
high indefinitely or only for a period of time?
The traditional view of the production process is that capital is subject to 
diminishing returns: As the stock of capital rises, the extra output produced from 
an additional unit of capital falls. In other words, when workers already have a 
large quantity of capital to use in producing goods and services, giving them an 
additional unit of capital increases their productivity only slightly. This is illus-
trated in Figure 1, which shows how the amount of capital per worker determines 
the amount of output per worker, holding constant all the other determinants of 
output. 
Because of diminishing returns, an increase in the saving rate leads to higher 
growth only for a while. As the higher saving rate allows more capital to be accu-
mulated, the benefits from additional capital become smaller over time, and so 
growth slows down. In the long run, the higher saving rate leads to a higher level of 
productivity and income but not to higher growth in these variables. Reaching this long 
run, however, can take quite a while. According to studies of international data 
on economic growth, increasing the saving rate can lead to substantially higher 
growth for a period of several decades.
The diminishing returns to capital has another important implication: Other 
things equal, it is easier for a country to grow fast if it starts out relatively poor. 
This effect of initial conditions on subsequent growth is sometimes called the 
catch-up effect. In poor countries, workers lack even the most rudimentary tools 
and, as a result, have low productivity. Small amounts of capital investment 
would substantially raise these workers’ productivity. By contrast, workers in 
rich countries have large amounts of capital with which to work, and this partly

explains their high productivity. Yet with the amount of capital per worker 
already so high, additional capital investment has a relatively small effect on pro-
ductivity. Studies of international data on economic growth confirm this catch-up 
effect: Controlling for other variables, such as the percentage of GDP devoted to 
investment, poor countries tend to grow at faster rates than rich countries.
This catch-up effect can help explain some otherwise puzzling facts. Here’s an 
example: From 1960 to 1990, the United States and South Korea devoted a similar 
share of GDP to investment. Yet over this time, the United States experienced 
only mediocre growth of about 2 percent, while South Korea experienced spec-
tacular growth of more than 6 percent. The explanation is the catch-up effect. In 
1960, South Korea had GDP per person less than one-tenth the U.S. level, in part 
because previous investment had been so low. With a small initial capital stock, 
the benefits to capital accumulation were much greater in South Korea, and this 
gave South Korea a higher subsequent growth rate.
This catch-up effect shows up in other aspects of life. When a school gives an 
end-of-year award to the “Most Improved” student, that student is usually one 
who began the year with relatively poor performance. Students who began the 
year not studying find improvement easier than students who always worked 
hard. Note that it is good to be “Most Improved,” given the starting point, but it is 
even better to be “Best Student.” Similarly, economic growth over the last several 
decades has been much more rapid in South Korea than in the United States, but 
GDP per person is still higher in the United States.
Investment from Abroad
So far, we have discussed how policies aimed at increasing a country’s saving rate 
can increase investment and, thereby, long-term economic growth. Yet saving by

domestic residents is not the only way for a country to invest in new capital. The 
other way is investment by foreigners. 
Investment from abroad takes several forms. Ford Motor Company might 
build a car factory in Mexico. A capital investment that is owned and operated 
by a foreign entity is called foreign direct investment. Alternatively, an American 
might buy stock in a Mexican corporation (that is, buy a share in the ownership 
of the corporation); the Mexican corporation can use the proceeds from the stock 
sale to build a new factory. An investment that is financed with foreign money 
but operated by domestic residents is called foreign portfolio investment. In both 
cases, Americans provide the resources necessary to increase the stock of capital 
in Mexico. That is, American saving is being used to finance Mexican investment.
When foreigners invest in a country, they do so because they expect to earn a 
return on their investment. Ford’s car factory increases the Mexican capital stock 
and, therefore, increases Mexican productivity and Mexican GDP. Yet Ford takes 
some of this additional income back to the United States in the form of profit. 
Similarly, when an American investor buys Mexican stock, the investor has a right 
to a portion of the profit that the Mexican corporation earns.
Investment from abroad, therefore, does not have the same effect on all mea-
sures of economic prosperity. Recall that gross domestic product (GDP) is the 
income earned within a country by both residents and nonresidents, whereas 
gross national product (GNP) is the income earned by residents of a country both 
at home and abroad. When Ford opens its car factory in Mexico, some of the 
income the factory generates accrues to people who do not live in Mexico. As a 
result, foreign investment in Mexico raises the income of Mexicans (measured by 
GNP) by less than it raises the production in Mexico (measured by GDP).
Nonetheless, investment from abroad is one way for a country to grow. Even 
though some of the benefits from this investment flow back to the foreign owners, 
this investment does increase the economy’s stock of capital, leading to higher 
productivity and higher wages. Moreover, investment from abroad is one way 
for poor countries to learn the state-of-the-art technologies developed and used 
in richer countries. For these reasons, many economists who advise governments 
in less developed economies advocate policies that encourage investment from 
abroad. Often, this means removing restrictions that governments have imposed 
on foreign ownership of domestic capital.
An organization that tries to encourage the flow of capital to poor countries is 
the World Bank. This international organization obtains funds from the world’s 
advanced countries, such as the United States, and uses these resources to make 
loans to less developed countries so that they can invest in roads, sewer systems, 
schools, and other types of capital. It also offers the countries advice about how 
the funds might best be used. The World Bank, together with its sister organi-
zation, the International Monetary Fund, was set up after World War II. One 
lesson from the war was that economic distress often leads to political turmoil, 
international tensions, and military conflict. Thus, every country has an interest 
in promoting economic prosperity around the world. The World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund were established to achieve that common goal.
Education
Education—investment in human capital—is at least as important as investment 
in physical capital for a country’s long-run economic success. In the United States, 
each year of schooling has historically raised a person’s wage by an average of 
about 10 percent. In less developed countries, where human capital is especially

scarce, the gap between the wages of educated and uneducated workers is even 
larger. Thus, one way government policy can enhance the standard of living is to 
provide good schools and to encourage the population to take advantage of them.
Investment in human capital, like investment in physical capital, has an oppor-
tunity cost. When students are in school, they forgo the wages they could have 
earned as members of the labor force. In less developed countries, children often 
drop out of school at an early age, even though the benefit of additional school-
ing is very high, simply because their labor is needed to help support the family.
Some economists have argued that human capital is particularly important 
for economic growth because human capital conveys positive externalities. An 
externality is the effect of one person’s actions on the well-being of a bystander. 
An educated person, for instance, might generate new ideas about how best to 
produce goods and services. If these ideas enter society’s pool of knowledge so 
that everyone can use them, then the ideas are an external benefit of education. 
In this case, the return to schooling for society is even greater than the return for 
the individual. This argument would justify the large subsidies to human-capital 
investment that we observe in the form of public education. 
One problem facing some poor countries is the brain drain—the emigration of 
many of the most highly educated workers to rich countries, where these work-
ers can enjoy a higher standard of living. If human capital does have positive 
externalities, then this brain drain makes those people left behind poorer than 
they otherwise would be. This problem offers policymakers a dilemma. On the 
one hand, the United States and other rich countries have the best systems of 
higher education, and it would seem natural for poor countries to send their best 
students abroad to earn higher degrees. On the other hand, those students who 
have spent time abroad may choose not to return home, and this brain drain will 
reduce the poor nation’s stock of human capital even further.
Health and Nutrition
The term human capital usually refers to education, but it can also be used to 
describe another type of investment in people: expenditures that lead to a health-
ier population. Other things equal, healthier workers are more productive. The 
right investments in the health of the population provide one way for a nation to 
increase productivity and raise living standards.
Economic historian Robert Fogel has suggested that a significant factor in 
long-run economic growth is improved health from better nutrition. He estimates 
that in Great Britain in 1780, about one in five people were so malnourished that 
they were incapable of manual labor. Among those who could work, insufficient 
caloric intake substantially reduced the work effort they could put forth. As nutri-
tion improved, so did workers’ productivity.
Fogel studies these historical trends in part by looking at the height of the 
population. Short stature can be an indicator of malnutrition, especially during 
gestation and the early years of life. Fogel finds that as nations develop eco-
nomically, people eat more, and the population gets taller. From 1775 to 1975, 
the average caloric intake in Great Britain rose by 26 percent, and the height of 
the average man rose by 3.6 inches. Similarly, during the spectacular economic 
growth in South Korea from 1962 to 1995, caloric consumption rose by 44 percent, 
and average male height rose by 2 inches. Of course, a person’s height is deter-
mined by a combination of genetic predisposition and environment. But because 
the genetic makeup of a population is slow to change, such increases in average

height are most likely due to changes in the environment—nutrition being the 
obvious explanation.
Moreover, studies have found that height is an indicator of productivity. 
Looking at data on a large number of workers at a point in time, researchers have 
found that taller workers tend to earn more. Because wages reflect a worker’s 
productivity, this finding suggests that taller workers tend to be more productive. 
The effect of height on wages is especially pronounced in poorer countries, where 
malnutrition is a bigger risk. 
 Promoting Human Capital
Because human capital is a key to economic growth, some developing 
countries give parents an immediate financial incentive to keep their 
children in school.

But this year he qualified for a small 
monthly cash payment from the government

This year, Vandelson will finally pass the

in a new breed of social program that is 
spreading swiftly across Latin America. It is a 
developing-country version of American wel-
fare reform: to break the cycle of poverty, the 
government gives the poor small cash pay-
ments in exchange for keeping their children 
in school and taking them for regular medical 
checkups.
	
“I think these programs are as close as you 
can come to a magic bullet in development,” 
said Nancy Birdsall, president of the Center 
for Global Development, a nonprofit research 
group in Washington. “They’re creating an

their grant of $27 a month makes it possible

Mr. Souza and Ms. Torres, illiterate

Fogel won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1993 for his work in economic 
history, which includes not only his studies of nutrition but also his studies of 
American slavery and the role of railroads in the development of the American 
economy. In the lecture he gave when he was awarded the prize, he surveyed the 
evidence on health and economic growth. He concluded that “improved gross 
nutrition accounts for roughly 30 percent of the growth of per capita income in 
Britain between 1790 and 1980.”
Today, malnutrition is fortunately rare in developed nations such as Great 
Britain and the United States. (Obesity is a more widespread problem.) But for peo-
ple in developing nations, poor health and inadequate nutrition remain obstacles to 
higher productivity and improved living standards. The United Nations estimates 
that almost a third of the population in sub-Saharan Africa is undernourished.
The causal link between health and wealth runs in both directions. Poor coun-
tries are poor in part because their populations are not healthy, and their popula-
tions are not healthy in part because they are poor and cannot afford adequate 
healthcare and nutrition. It is a vicious circle. But this fact opens the possibility of a 
virtuous circle: Policies that lead to more rapid economic growth would naturally 
improve health outcomes, which in turn would further promote economic growth.
Property Rights and Political Stability
Another way policymakers can foster economic growth is by protecting property 
rights and promoting political stability. This issue goes to the very heart of how 
market economies work.
Production in market economies arises from the interactions of millions of 
individuals and firms. When you buy a car, for instance, you are buying the 
output of a car dealer, a car manufacturer, a steel company, an iron ore mining 
company, and so on. This division of production among many firms allows the 
economy’s factors of production to be used as effectively as possible. To achieve 
this outcome, the economy has to coordinate transactions among these firms, as 
well as between firms and consumers. Market economies achieve this coordina-
tion through market prices. That is, market prices are the instrument with which 
the invisible hand of the marketplace brings supply and demand into balance in 
each of the many thousands of markets that make up the economy.
An important prerequisite for the price system to work is an economy-wide 
respect for property rights. Property rights refer to the ability of people to exercise 
authority over the resources they own. A mining company will not make the effort 
to mine iron ore if it expects the ore to be stolen. The company mines the ore only 
if it is confident that it will benefit from the ore’s subsequent sale. For this reason, 
courts serve an important role in a market economy: They enforce property rights. 
Through the criminal justice system, the courts discourage direct theft. In addi-
tion, through the civil justice system, the courts ensure that buyers and sellers live 
up to their contracts.
Those of us in developed countries tend to take property rights for granted, but 
those living in less developed countries understand that a lack of property rights 
can be a major problem. In many countries, the system of justice does not work 
well. Contracts are hard to enforce, and fraud often goes unpunished. In more 
extreme cases, the government not only fails to enforce property rights but actu-
ally infringes upon them. To do business in some countries, firms are expected to 
bribe government officials. Such corruption impedes the coordinating power of 
markets. It also discourages domestic saving and investment from abroad.

One threat to property rights is political instability. When revolutions and 
coups are common, there is doubt about whether property rights will be respected 
in the future. If a revolutionary government might confiscate the capital of some 
businesses, as was often true after communist revolutions, domestic residents 
have less incentive to save, invest, and start new businesses. At the same time, 
foreigners have less incentive to invest in the country. Even the threat of revolu-
tion can act to depress a nation’s standard of living.
Thus, economic prosperity depends in part on political prosperity. A country 
with an efficient court system, honest government officials, and a stable constitu-
tion will enjoy a higher economic standard of living than a country with a poor 
court system, corrupt officials, and frequent revolutions and coups.
Free Trade
Some of the world’s poorest countries have tried to achieve more rapid economic 
growth by pursuing inward-oriented policies. These policies attempt to increase 
productivity and living standards within the country by avoiding interaction 
with the rest of the world. Domestic firms often advance the infant-industry argu-
ment, claiming they need protection from foreign competition to thrive and grow. 
Together with a general distrust of foreigners, this argument has at times led policy­
makers in less developed countries to impose tariffs and other trade restrictions.
Most economists today believe that poor countries are better off pursuing 
outward-oriented policies that integrate these countries into the world economy. 
International trade in goods and services can improve the economic well-being of 
a country’s citizens. Trade is, in some ways, a type of technology. When a country 
exports wheat and imports textiles, the country benefits as if it had invented a 
technology for turning wheat into textiles. A country that eliminates trade restric-
tions will, therefore, experience the same kind of economic growth that would 
occur after a major technological advance. 
The adverse impact of inward orientation becomes clear when one considers 
the small size of many less developed economies. The total GDP of Argentina, 
for instance, is about that of Philadelphia. Imagine what would happen if the 
Philadelphia city council were to prohibit city residents from trading with people 
living outside the city limits. Without being able to take advantage of the gains 
from trade, Philadelphia would need to produce all the goods it consumes. It 
would also have to produce all its own capital goods, rather than importing 
state-of-the-art equipment from other cities. Living standards in Philadelphia 
would fall immediately, and the problem would likely only get worse over time. 
This is precisely what happened when Argentina pursued inward-oriented 
policies throughout much of the 20th century. In contrast, countries that pursued 
outward-oriented policies, such as South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, enjoyed 
high rates of economic growth.
The amount that a nation trades with others is determined not only by govern-
ment policy but also by geography. Countries with natural seaports find trade easier 
than countries without this resource. It is not a coincidence that many of the world’s 
major cities, such as New York, San Francisco, and Hong Kong, are located next to 
oceans. Similarly, because landlocked countries find international trade more dif-
ficult, they tend to have lower levels of income than countries with easy access to 
the world’s waterways. For example, countries with more than 80 percent of their 
population living within 100 kilometers of a coast have an average GDP per person 
about four times as large as countries with less than 20 percent of their population

living near a coast. The critical importance of access to the sea helps explain why the 
African continent, which contains many landlocked countries, is so poor.
Research and Development
The primary reason that living standards are higher today than they were a cen-
tury ago is that technological knowledge has advanced. The telephone, the transis-
tor, the computer, and the internal combustion engine are among the thousands of 
innovations that have improved the ability to produce goods and services. 
Most technological advances come from private research by firms and indi-
vidual inventors, but there is also a public interest in promoting these efforts. To a 
large extent, knowledge is a public good: That is, once one person discovers an idea, 
the idea enters society’s pool of knowledge, and other people can freely use it. Just 
as government has a role in providing a public good such as national defense, it 
also has a role in encouraging the research and development of new technologies.
The U.S. government has long played a role in the creation and dissemination 
of technological knowledge. A century ago, the government sponsored research 
about farming methods and advised farmers how best to use their land. More 
recently, the U.S. government, through the Air Force and NASA, has supported 
aerospace research; as a result, the United States is a leading maker of rockets 
and planes. The government continues to encourage advances in knowledge with 
research grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes 
of Health and with tax breaks for firms engaging in research and development.
Yet another way in which government policy encourages research is through the 
patent system. When a person or firm invents a new product, such as a new drug, the 
inventor can apply for a patent. If the product is deemed truly original, the government 
awards the patent, which gives the inventor the exclusive right to make the product 
for a specified number of years. In essence, the patent gives the inventor a property 
right over his invention, turning his new idea from a public good into a private good. 
By allowing inventors to profit from their inventions—even if only temporarily—the 
patent system enhances the incentive for individuals and firms to engage in research.
Population Growth
Economists and other social scientists have long debated how population affects a soci-
ety. The most direct effect is on the size of the labor force: A large population means 
more workers to produce goods and services. The tremendous size of the Chinese 
population is one reason China is such an important player in the world economy.
At the same time, however, a large population means more people to consume 
those goods and services. So while a large population means a larger total output of 
goods and services, it need not mean a higher standard of living for a typical citizen. 
Indeed, both large and small nations are found at all levels of economic development.
Beyond these obvious effects of population size, population growth interacts 
with the other factors of production in ways that are more subtle and open to debate.
Stretching Natural Resources  Thomas Robert Malthus (1766–1834), an 
English minister and early economic thinker, is famous for his book called An 
Essay on the Principle of Population as It Affects the Future Improvement of Society. In 
it, he offered what may be history’s most chilling forecast. Malthus argued that an 
ever-increasing population would continually strain society’s ability to provide 
for itself. As a result, mankind was doomed to forever live in poverty.
Malthus’s logic was simple. He began by noting that “food is necessary to the 
existence of man” and that “the passion between the sexes is necessary and will

remain nearly in its present state.” He concluded that “the power of population 
is infinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man.” 
According to Malthus, the only check on population growth was “misery and 
vice.” Attempts by charities or governments to alleviate poverty were counter­
productive, he argued, because they merely allowed the poor to have more 
children, placing even greater strains on society’s productive capabilities. 
Malthus may have correctly described the world at the time when he lived, 
but fortunately, his dire forecast was far off the mark. The world population has 
increased about sixfold over the past two centuries, but living standards around the 
world are on average much higher. As a result of economic growth, chronic hunger 
and malnutrition are less common now than they were in Malthus’s day. Modern 
famines occur from time to time but are more often the result of an unequal income 
distribution or political instability than inadequate food production.
Where did Malthus go wrong? As we discussed in a case study earlier in this 
chapter, growth in human ingenuity has offset the effects of a larger population. 
Pesticides, fertilizers, mechanized farm equipment, new crop varieties, and other 
technological advances that Malthus never imagined have allowed each farmer to 
feed ever greater numbers of people. Even with more mouths to feed, fewer farmers 
are necessary because each farmer is much more productive.
Diluting the Capital Stock  Whereas Malthus worried about the effects of popu­
lation on the use of natural resources, some modern theories of economic growth 
emphasize its effects on capital accumulation. According to these theories, high 
population growth reduces GDP per worker because rapid growth in the number of 
workers forces the capital stock to be spread more thinly. In other words, when popu­
lation growth is rapid, each worker is equipped with less capital. A smaller quantity 
of capital per worker leads to lower productivity and lower GDP per worker. 
This problem is most apparent in the case of human capital. Countries with 
high population growth have large numbers of school-age children. This places 
a larger burden on the educational system. It is not surprising, therefore, that 
educational attainment tends to be low in countries with high population growth.
The differences in population growth around the world are large. In developed 
countries, such as the United States and those in Western Europe, the popula-
tion has risen only about 1 percent per year in recent decades and is expected to 
rise even more slowly in the future. By contrast, in many poor African countries, 
population grows at about 3 percent per year. At this rate, the population doubles 
every 23 years. This rapid population growth makes it harder to provide workers 
with the tools and skills they need to achieve high levels of productivity.
Rapid population growth is not the main reason that less developed countries 
are poor, but some analysts believe that reducing the rate of population growth 
would help these countries raise their standards of living. In some countries, this 
goal is accomplished directly with laws that regulate the number of children fami-
lies may have. China, for instance, allows only one child per family; couples who 
violate this rule are subject to substantial fines. In countries with greater freedom, 
the goal of reduced population growth is accomplished less directly by increasing 
awareness of birth control techniques. 
Another way in which a country can influence population growth is to apply 
one of the Ten Principles of Economics: People respond to incentives. Bearing a 
child, like any decision, has an opportunity cost. When the opportunity cost rises, 
people will choose to have smaller families. In particular, women with the oppor-
tunity to receive a good education and desirable employment tend to want fewer

children than those with fewer opportunities outside the home. Hence, policies 
that foster equal treatment of women may be one way for less developed econo-
mies to reduce the rate of population growth and, perhaps, raise their standards 
of living.
 One Economist’s Answer
MIT economist Daron Acemoglu considers why some nations thrive 
while others do not.
in the news
What Makes  
a Nation Rich?
By Daron Acemoglu
W
e are the rich, the haves, the devel-
oped. And most of the rest—in 
Africa, South Asia, and South America, the 
Somalias and Bolivias and Bangladeshes of 
the world—are the nots. It’s always been 
this way, a globe divided by wealth and 
poverty, health and sickness, food and fam-
ine, though the extent of inequality across 
nations today is unprecedented: The aver-
age citizen of the United States is ten times 
as prosperous as the average Guatemalan, 
more than twenty times as prosperous as 
the average North Korean, and more than 
forty times as prosperous as those living in 
Mali, Ethiopia, Congo, or Sierra Leone. 
	
The question social scientists have 
unsuccessfully wrestled with for centuries 
is, Why? But the question they should 
have been asking is, How? Because 
inequality is not predetermined. Nations 
are not like children—they are not born 
rich or poor. Their governments make 
them that way.
	
You can chart the search for a the-
ory of inequality to the French political 
philosopher Montesquieu, who in the 
mid-eighteenth century came up with a 
very simple explanation: People in hot 
places are inherently lazy. Other no less 
sweeping explanations soon followed: 
Could it be that Max Weber’s Protestant 
work ethic is the true driver of economic 
success? Or perhaps the richest countries 
are those that were former British colo-
nies? Or maybe it’s as simple as tracing 
which nations have the largest popula-
tions of European descent? The problem 
with all of these theories is that while 
they superficially fit some specific cases, 
others radically disprove them. 
	
It’s the same with the theories put forth 
today. Economist Jeffrey Sachs, director 
of Columbia University’s Earth Institute, 
attributes the relative success of nations 
to geography and weather: In the poorest 
parts of the world, he argues, nutrient-
starved tropical soil makes agriculture a 
challenge, and tropical climates foment 
disease, particularly malaria. Perhaps if 
we were to fix these problems, teach the 
citizens of these nations better farming 
techniques, eliminate malaria, or at the 
very least equip them with artemisinin to 
fight this deadly disease, we could elimi-
nate poverty. Or better yet, perhaps we just 
move these people and abandon their 
inhospitable land altogether.
	
Jared Diamond, the famous ecologist 
and best-selling author, has a different 
theory: The origin of world inequality stems 
from the historical endowment of plant and 
animal species and the advancement of 
technology. In Diamond’s telling, the cul-
tures that first learned to plant crops were 
the first to learn how to use a plow, and thus 
were first to adopt other technologies, the 
engine of every successful economy. Perhaps 
then the solution to world inequality rests in 
technology—wiring the developing world 
with Internet and cell phones.
	
And yet while Sachs and Diamond offer 
good insight into certain aspects of poverty, 
they share something in common with 
Montesquieu and others who followed: 
They ignore incentives. People need incen-
tives to invest and prosper; they need to 
know that if they work hard, they can make 
money and actually keep that money. And 
the key to ensuring those incentives is 
sound institutions—the rule of law and 
security and a governing system that offers 
opportunities to achieve and innovate. 
That’s what determines the haves from the 
have-nots—not geography or weather or 
technology or disease or ethnicity.
	
Put simply: Fix incentives and you will fix 
poverty. And if you wish to fix institutions, 
you have to fix governments.
	
How do we know that institutions are 
so central to the wealth and poverty of 
nations? Start in Nogales, a city cut in half

Promoting Technological Progress  Rapid population growth may depress 
economic prosperity by reducing the amount of capital each worker has, but 
it may also have some benefits. Some economists have suggested that world 
population growth has been an engine of technological progress and economic 
by the Mexican-American border fence. 
There is no difference in geography between 
the two halves of Nogales. The weather 
is the same. The winds are the same, as are 
the soils. The types of diseases prevalent in 
the area given its geography and climate 
are the same, as is the ethnic, cultural, and 
linguistic background of the residents. By 
logic, both sides of the city should be identi-
cal economically. 
	
And yet they are far from the same. 
	
On one side of the border fence, in 
Santa Cruz County, Arizona, the median 
household income is $30,000. A few feet 
away, it’s $10,000. On one side, most of 
the teenagers are in public high school, 
and the majority of the adults are high 
school graduates. On the other side, few of 
the residents have gone to high school, let 
alone college. Those in Arizona enjoy rela-
tively good health and Medicare for those 
over sixty-five, not to mention an effi-
cient road network, electricity, telephone 
service, and a dependable sewage and 
public-health system. None of those things 
are a given across the border. There, the 
roads are bad, the infant-mortality rate 
high, electricity and phone service expen-
sive and spotty. 
	
The key difference is that those on the 
north side of the border enjoy law and order 
and dependable government services—they 
can go about their daily activities and jobs 
without fear for their life or safety or property 
rights. On the other side, the inhabitants 
have institutions that perpetuate crime, graft, 
and insecurity.
	
Nogales may be the most obvious ex-
ample, but it’s far from the only one. Take 
Singapore, a once-impoverished tropical 
island that became the richest nation in Asia 
after British colonialists enshrined property 
rights and encouraged trade. Or China, 
where decades of stagnation and famine 
were reversed only after Deng Xiaoping 
began introducing private-property rights 
in agriculture, and later in industry. Or 
Botswana, whose economy has flourished 
over the past forty years while the rest of 
Africa has withered, thanks to strong tribal 
institutions and farsighted nation building 
by its early elected leaders.
	
Now look at the economic and political 
failures. You can begin in Sierra Leone, 
where a lack of functioning institutions 
and an overabundance of diamonds have 
fueled decades of civil war and strife and 
corruption that continue unchecked today. 
Or take communist North Korea, a geo-
graphical, ethnic, and cultural mirror of its 
capitalist neighbor to the south, yet ten 
times poorer. Or Egypt, cradle of one of 
the world’s great civilizations yet stagnant 
economically ever since its colonization 
by the Ottomans and then the Europeans, 
only made worse by its post-independence 
governments, which have restricted all 
economic activities and markets. In fact, 
the theory can be used to shed light on 
the patterns of inequality for much of the 
world. 
	
If we know why nations are poor, the 
resulting question is what can we do to 
help them. Our ability to impose institutions 
from the outside is limited, as the recent 
U.S. experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq 
demonstrate. But we are not helpless, and 
in many instances, there is a lot to be done. 
Even the most repressed citizens of the 
world will stand up to tyrants when given 
the opportunity. We saw this recently in Iran 
and a few years ago in Ukraine during the 
Orange Revolution.
	
The U.S. must not take a passive role 
in encouraging these types of movements. 
Our foreign policy should encourage them 
by punishing repressive regimes through 
trade embargoes and diplomacy…. At the 
microlevel, we can help foreign citizens 
by educating them and arming them with 
the modern tools of activism, most notably 
the Internet, and perhaps even encryption 
technology and cell-phone platforms that 
can evade firewalls and censorship put in 
place by repressive governments, such as 
those in China or Iran, that fear the power 
of information. 
	
There’s no doubt that erasing global 
inequality, which has been with us for 
millennia and has expanded to unprec-
edented levels over the past century and a 
half, won’t be easy. But by accepting the 
role of failed governments and institutions 
in causing poverty, we have a fighting 
chance of reversing it.

prosperity. The mechanism is simple: If there are more people, then there are 
more scientists, inventors, and engineers to contribute to technological advance, 
which benefits everyone.
Economist Michael Kremer has provided some support for this hypothesis in 
an article titled “Population Growth and Technological Change: One Million b.c. 
to 1990,” which was published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1993. 
Kremer begins by noting that over the broad span of human history, world 
growth rates have increased with world population. For example, world growth 
was more rapid when the world population was 1 billion (which occurred around 
the year 1800) than when the population was only 100 million (around 500 b.c.). 
This fact is consistent with the hypothesis that a larger population induces more 
technological progress.
Kremer’s second piece of evidence comes from comparing regions of the world. 
The melting of the polar icecaps at the end of the Ice Age around 10,000 b.c. 
flooded the land bridges and separated the world into several distinct regions that 
could not communicate with one another for thousands of years. If technological 
progress is more rapid when there are more people to discover things, then larger 
regions should have experienced more rapid growth.
According to Kremer, that is exactly what happened. The most successful 
region of the world in 1500 (when Columbus reestablished technological contact) 
comprised the “Old World” civilizations of the large Eurasia-Africa region. Next 
in technological development were the Aztec and Mayan civilizations in the 
Americas, followed by the hunter-gatherers of Australia, and then the primitive 
people of Tasmania, who lacked even fire-making and most stone and bone tools. 
The smallest isolated region was Flinders Island, a tiny island between Tasmania 
and Australia. With the smallest population, Flinders Island had the fewest oppor-
tunities for technological advance and, indeed, seemed to regress. Around 3000 
b.c., human society on Flinders Island died out completely. A large population, 
Kremer concludes, is a prerequisite for technological advance.
Quick Quiz  Describe three ways a government policymaker can try to raise the 
growth in living standards in a society. Are there any drawbacks to these policies?
Conclusion: The Importance of Long-Run Growth
In this chapter, we have discussed what determines the standard of living in 
a nation and how policymakers can endeavor to raise the standard of living 
through policies that promote economic growth. Most of this chapter is sum-
marized in one of the Ten Principles of Economics: A country’s standard of living 
depends on its ability to produce goods and services. Policymakers who want to 
encourage growth in living standards must aim to increase their nation’s produc-
tive ability by encouraging rapid accumulation of the factors of production and 
ensuring that these factors are employed as effectively as possible.
Economists differ in their views of the role of government in promoting eco-
nomic growth. At the very least, government can lend support to the invisible 
hand by maintaining property rights and political stability. More controversial is 
whether government should target and subsidize specific industries that might 
be especially important for technological progress. There is no doubt that these 
issues are among the most important in economics. The success of one genera-
tion’s policymakers in learning and heeding the fundamental lessons about eco-
nomic growth determines what kind of world the next generation will inherit.

Summary
• Economic prosperity, as measured by GDP per 
person, varies substantially around the world. 
The average income in the world’s richest coun-
tries is more than ten times that in the world’s 
poorest countries. Because growth rates of real 
GDP also vary substantially, the relative positions 
of countries can change dramatically over time. 
• The standard of living in an economy depends on 
the economy’s ability to produce goods and ser-
vices. Productivity, in turn, depends on the phys-
ical capital, human capital, natural resources, and 
technological knowledge available to workers.
• Government policies can try to influence the 
economy’s growth rate in many ways: by encour-
aging saving and investment, encouraging 
investment from abroad, fostering education, 
promoting good health, maintaining property 
rights and political stability, allowing free trade, 
and promoting the research and development of 
new technologies.
• The accumulation of capital is subject to dimin-
ishing returns: The more capital an economy has, 
the less additional output the economy gets from 
an extra unit of capital. As a result, while higher 
saving leads to higher growth for a period of 
time, growth eventually slows down as capital, 
productivity, and income rise. Also because of 
diminishing returns, the return to capital is espe-
cially high in poor countries. Other things equal, 
these countries can grow faster because of the 
catch-up effect. 
• Population growth has a variety of effects on 
economic growth. On the one hand, more rapid 
population growth may lower productivity by 
stretching the supply of natural resources and 
by reducing the amount of capital available for 
each worker. On the other hand, a larger popu-
lation may enhance the rate of technological 
progress because there are more scientists and 
engineers.

Problems and Applications
	 1.	 Most countries, including the United States, 
import substantial amounts of goods and 
services from other countries. Yet the chapter 
says that a nation can enjoy a high standard of 
living only if it can produce a large quantity 
of goods and services itself. Can you reconcile 
these two facts?
	 2.	 Suppose that society decided to reduce 
consumption and increase investment.
	a.	 How would this change affect economic 
growth?
	b.	What groups in society would benefit from 
this change? What groups might be hurt?
	 3.	 Societies choose what share of their resources 
to devote to consumption and what share to 
devote to investment. Some of these decisions 
involve private spending; others involve 
government spending.
	a.	 Describe some forms of private spending that 
represent consumption and some forms that 
represent investment. The national income 
accounts include tuition as a part of consumer 
spending. In your opinion, are the resources 
you devote to your education a form of 
consumption or a form of investment? 
	b.	Describe some forms of government  
spending that represent consumption and 
some forms that represent investment. In 
your opinion, should we view government 
spending on health programs as a form of 
consumption or investment? Would you 
distinguish between health programs for the 
young and health programs for the elderly?
	 4.	 What is the opportunity cost of investing  
in capital? Do you think a country can 
“overinvest” in capital? What is the 
opportunity cost of investing in human 
capital? Do you think a country can 
“overinvest” in human capital? Explain.
	 5.	 Suppose that an auto company owned entirely 
by German citizens opens a new factory in 
South Carolina.
	a.	 What sort of foreign investment would this 
represent?
	b.	What would be the effect of this investment 
on U.S. GDP? Would the effect on U.S. GNP 
be larger or smaller?
	 6.	 In the 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s, 
investors from the Asian economies of Japan 
and China made significant direct and  
portfolio investments in the United States. At 
the time, many Americans were unhappy that 
this investment was occurring.
	a.	 In what way was it better for the United 
States to receive this foreign investment than 
not to receive it?
	b.	In what way would it have been better 
still for Americans to have made this 
investment?
	 7.	 In many developing nations, young women 
have lower enrollment rates in secondary school 
than do young men. Describe several ways in 
which greater educational opportunities for 
young women could lead to faster economic 
growth in these countries.
	 8.	 International data show a positive correlation 
between income per person and the health of 
the population.
	a.	 Explain how higher income might cause  
better health outcomes.
	b.	Explain how better health outcomes might 
cause higher income.
	c.	 How might the relative importance of your 
two hypotheses be relevant for public policy?
	 9.	 International data show a positive correlation 
between political stability and economic  
growth.
	a.	 Through what mechanism could political 
stability lead to strong economic growth?
	b.	Through what mechanism could strong 
economic growth lead to political stability?
	10.	 From 1950 to 2000, manufacturing employment 
as a percentage of total employment in the U.S. 
economy fell from 28 percent to 13 percent.  
At the same time, manufacturing output  
experienced slightly more rapid growth than 
the overall economy.
	a.	 What do these facts say about growth in 
labor productivity (defined as output per 
worker) in manufacturing?
	b.	In your opinion, should policymakers be 
concerned about the decline in the share of 
manufacturing employment? Explain.
