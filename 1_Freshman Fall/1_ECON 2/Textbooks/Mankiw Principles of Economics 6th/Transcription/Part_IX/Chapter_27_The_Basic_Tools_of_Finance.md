The Basic Tools of 
    Finance 
S
ometime in your life, you will have to deal with the economy’s financial sys-
tem. You will deposit your savings in a bank account, or you will take out a 
mortgage to buy a house. After you have a job, you will decide whether to 
invest the funds in your retirement account in stocks, bonds, or other finan-
cial instruments. If you try to put together your own portfolio, you will have to 
decide between buying stocks in established companies such as General Electric 
or newer ones such as Google. And whenever you watch the evening news, you 
will hear reports about whether the stock market is up or down, together with the 
often feeble attempts to explain why the market behaves as it does.
If you reflect for a moment on the many financial decisions you will make dur-
ing your life, you will see two related elements in almost all of them: time and 
risk. As we saw in the preceding two chapters, the financial system coordinates 
the economy’s saving and investment, which in turn are crucial determinants of 
economic growth. Most fundamentally, the financial system concerns decisions 
and actions we undertake today that will affect our lives in the future. But the

future is unknown. When a person decides to allocate some saving, or a firm 
decides to undertake an investment, the decision is based on a guess about the 
likely result. The actual result, however, could end up being very different from 
what was expected.
This chapter introduces some tools that help us understand the decisions that 
people make as they participate in financial markets. The field of finance devel-
ops these tools in great detail, and you may choose to take courses that focus on 
this topic. But because the financial system is so important to the functioning of 
the economy, many of the basic insights of finance are central to understanding 
how the economy works. The tools of finance may also help you think through 
some of the decisions that you will make in your own life.
This chapter takes up three topics. First, we discuss how to compare sums of 
money at different points in time. Second, we discuss how to manage risk. Third, 
we build on our analysis of time and risk to examine what determines the value 
of an asset, such as a share of stock.
Present Value: Measuring the Time Value of Money 
Imagine that someone offers to give you $100 today or $100 in 10 years. Which 
would you choose? This is an easy question. Getting $100 today is better because 
you can always deposit the money in a bank, still have it in 10 years, and earn 
interest on the $100 along the way. The lesson: Money today is more valuable than 
the same amount of money in the future.
Now consider a harder question: Imagine that someone offers you $100 today 
or $200 in 10 years. Which would you choose? To answer this question, you need 
some way to compare sums of money from different points in time. Economists 
do this with a concept called present value. The present value of any future sum 
of money is the amount today that would be needed, at current interest rates, to 
produce that future sum.
To learn how to use the concept of present value, let’s work through a couple 
of simple examples: 
Question: If you put $100 in a bank account today, how much will it be worth 
in N years? That is, what will be the future value of this $100?
Answer: Let’s use r to denote the interest rate expressed in decimal form (so an 
interest rate of 5 percent means r = 0.05). Suppose that interest is paid annually 
and that the interest paid remains in the bank account to earn more interest—a 
process called compounding. Then the $100 will become 
	
(1 + r) × $100	
after 1 year,
	
(1 + r) × (1 + r) × $100 = (1 + r)2 × $100	
after 2 years,
	
(1 + r) × (1 + r) × (1 + r) × $100 = (1 + r)3 × $100	
after 3 years, . . .
	
(1 + r)N × $100	
after N years.
For example, if we are investing at an interest rate of 5 percent for 10 years, then 
the future value of the $100 will be (1.05)10 × $100, which is $163.
Question: Now suppose you are going to be paid $200 in N years. What is 
the present value of this future payment? That is, how much would you have to 
deposit in a bank right now to yield $200 in N years?

Answer: To answer this question, just turn the previous answer on its head. In 
the last question, we computed a future value from a present value by multiplying 
by the factor (1 + r)N. To compute a present value from a future value, we divide 
by the factor (1 + r)N. Thus, the present value of $200 in N years is $200/(1 + r)N. 
If that amount is deposited in a bank today, after N years it would become 
(1 + r)N × [$200/(1 + r)N], which is $200. For instance, if the interest rate is 5 per-
cent, the present value of $200 in 10 years is $200/(1.05)10, which is $123. This 
means that $123 deposited today in a bank account that earned 5 percent would 
produce $200 after 10 years.
This illustrates the general formula: 
• 	 If r is the interest rate, then an amount X to be received in N years has a 
present value of X/(1 + r)N. 
Because the possibility of earning interest reduces the present value below the 
amount X, the process of finding a present value of a future sum of money is 
called discounting. This formula shows precisely how much future sums should 
be discounted.
Let’s now return to our earlier question: Should you choose $100 today or $200 
in 10 years? We can infer from our calculation of present value that if the inter-
est rate is 5 percent, you should prefer the $200 in 10 years. The future $200 has 
a present value of $123, which is greater than $100. You are better off waiting for 
the future sum.
Notice that the answer to our question depends on the interest rate. If the inter-
est rate were 8 percent, then the $200 in 10 years would have a present value of 
$200/(1.08)10, which is only $93. In this case, you should take the $100 today. Why 
should the interest rate matter for your choice? The answer is that the higher the 
interest rate, the more you can earn by depositing your money in a bank, so the 
more attractive getting $100 today becomes.
The concept of present value is useful in many applications, including the deci-
sions that companies face when evaluating investment projects. For instance, imag-
ine that General Motors is thinking about building a new factory. Suppose that the 
factory will cost $100 million today and will yield the company $200 million in 10 
years. Should General Motors undertake the project? You can see that this decision 
is exactly like the one we have been studying. To make its decision, the company 
will compare the present value of the $200 million return to the $100 million cost. 
The company’s decision, therefore, will depend on the interest rate. If the inter-
est rate is 5 percent, then the present value of the $200 million return from the 
factory is $123 million, and the company will choose to pay the $100 million cost. 
By contrast, if the interest rate is 8 percent, then the present value of the return 
is only $93 million, and the company will decide to forgo the project. Thus, the 
concept of present value helps explain why investment—and thus the quantity of 
loanable funds demanded—declines when the interest rate rises.
Here is another application of present value: Suppose you win a million-
dollar lottery and are given a choice between $20,000 a year for 50 years (totaling 
$1,000,000) or an immediate payment of $400,000. Which would you choose? To 
make the right choice, you need to calculate the present value of the stream of 
payments. Let’s suppose the interest rate is 7 percent. After performing 50 calcu-
lations similar to those above (one calculation for each payment) and adding up 
the results, you would learn that the present value of this million-dollar prize at 
a 7 percent interest rate is only $276,000. You are better off picking the ­immediate

FYI
 The Magic of Compounding and 
the Rule of 70
S
uppose you observe that one country has an average growth rate 
of 1 percent per year, while another has an average growth rate 
of 3 percent per year. At first, this might not seem like a big deal. 
What difference can 2 percent make? 
	
The answer is: a big difference. Growth rates that seem small 
when written in percentage terms are large after they are com-
pounded for many years. 
	
Consider an example. Suppose that two college graduates—
Finn and Quinn—both take their first jobs at the age of 22 earning 
$30,000 a year. Finn lives in an economy where all incomes grow 
at 1 percent per year, while Quinn lives in one where incomes grow 
at 3 percent per year. Straightforward calculations show what 
happens. Forty years later, when both are 62 years old, Finn earns 
$45,000 a year, while Quinn earns $98,000. Because of that dif-
ference of 2 percentage points in the growth rate, Quinn’s salary is 
more than twice Finn’s.
	
An old rule of thumb, called the rule of 70, is helpful in under-
standing growth rates and the effects of compounding. According to the 
rule of 70, if some variable grows at a rate of x percent per year, then 
that variable doubles in approximately 70/x years. In Finn’s economy, 
incomes grow at 1 percent per year, so it takes about 70 years for 
incomes to double. In Quinn’s economy, incomes grow at 3 percent per 
year, so it takes about 70/3, or 23, years for incomes to double.
	
The rule of 70 applies not only to a growing economy but also 
to a growing savings account. Here is an example: In 1791, Ben 
Franklin died and left $5,000 to be invested for a period of 200 
years to benefit medical students and scientific research. If this 
money had earned 7 percent per year (which would, in fact, have 
been possible to do), the investment would have doubled in value 
every 10 years. Over 200 years, it would have doubled 20 times. 
At the end of 200 years of compounding, the investment would 
have been worth 220 3 $5,000, which is about $5 billion. (In fact, 
Franklin’s $5,000 grew to only $2 million over 200 years because 
some of the money was spent along the way.)
	
As these examples show, growth rates and interest rates com-
pounded over many years can lead to some spectacular results. 
That is probably why Albert Einstein once called compounding “the 
greatest mathematical discovery of all time.” 
payment of $400,000. The million dollars may seem like more money, but the 
future cash flows, once discounted to the present, are worth far less.

Managing Risk
Life is full of gambles. When you go skiing, you risk breaking your leg in a fall. 
When you drive to work, you risk a car accident. When you put some of your sav-
ings in the stock market, you risk a fall in stock prices. The rational response to 
this risk is not necessarily to avoid it at any cost but to take it into account in your 
decision making. Let’s consider how a person might do that.
Risk Aversion
Most people are risk averse. This means more than that people dislike bad things 
happening to them. It means that they dislike bad things more than they like 
comparable good things.
For example, suppose a friend offers you the following opportunity. He will 
toss a coin. If it comes up heads, he will pay you $1,000. But if it comes up tails,

you will have to pay him $1,000. Would you accept the bargain? You wouldn’t if 
you were risk averse. For a risk-averse person, the pain of losing the $1,000 would 
exceed the pleasure from winning $1,000.
Economists have developed models of risk aversion using the concept of utility, 
which is a person’s subjective measure of well-being or satisfaction. Every level 
of wealth provides a certain amount of utility, as shown by the utility function in 
Figure 1. But the function exhibits the property of diminishing marginal utility: 
The more wealth a person has, the less utility he gets from an additional dollar. 
Thus, in the figure, the utility function gets flatter as wealth increases. Because 
of diminishing marginal utility, the utility lost from losing the $1,000 bet is more 
than the utility gained from winning it. As a result, people are risk averse.
Risk aversion provides the starting point for explaining various things we 
observe in the economy. Let’s consider three of them: insurance, diversification, 
and the risk-return trade-off.
The Markets for Insurance
One way to deal with risk is to buy insurance. The general feature of insurance 
contracts is that a person facing a risk pays a fee to an insurance company, which 
in return agrees to accept all or part of the risk. There are many types of insurance. 
Car insurance covers the risk of your being in an auto accident, fire insurance 
covers the risk that your house will burn down, health insurance covers the risk 
that you might need expensive medical treatment, and life insurance covers the 
risk that you will die and leave your family without your income. There is also 
insurance against the risk of living too long: For a fee paid today, an insurance 
company will pay you an annuity—a regular income every year until you die.
In a sense, every insurance contract is a gamble. It is possible that you will not 
be in an auto accident, that your house will not burn down, and that you will not 
need expensive medical treatment. In most years, you will pay the insurance com-
pany the premium and get nothing in return except peace of mind. Indeed, the 
insurance company is counting on the fact that most people will not make claims 
on their policies; otherwise, it couldn’t pay out the large claims to the unlucky few 
and still stay in business.
From the standpoint of the economy as a whole, the role of insurance is not 
to eliminate the risks inherent in life but to spread them around more efficiently. 
The Utility Function
This utility function shows how 
utility, a subjective measure 
of satisfaction, depends on 
wealth. As wealth rises, the 
utility function becomes flatter, 
reflecting the property of 
diminishing marginal utility. 
Because of diminishing marginal 
utility, a $1,000 loss decreases 
utility by more than a $1,000 gain 
increases it.

Consider fire insurance, for instance. Owning fire insurance does not reduce the 
risk of losing your home in a fire. But if that unlucky event occurs, the insurance 
company compensates you. The risk, rather than being borne by you alone, is 
shared among the thousands of insurance-company shareholders. Because people 
are risk averse, it is easier for 10,000 people to bear 1/10,000 of the risk than for 
one person to bear the entire risk himself.
The markets for insurance suffer from two types of problems that impede their 
ability to spread risk. One problem is adverse selection: A high-risk person is more 
likely to apply for insurance than a low-risk person because a high-risk person 
would benefit more from insurance protection. A second problem is moral hazard: 
After people buy insurance, they have less incentive to be careful about their 
risky behavior because the insurance company will cover much of the resulting 
losses. Insurance companies are aware of these problems, but they cannot fully 
guard against them. An insurance company cannot perfectly distinguish between 
high-risk and low-risk customers, and it cannot monitor all of its customers’ risky 
behavior. The price of insurance reflects the actual risks that the insurance com-
pany will face after the insurance is bought. The high price of insurance is why 
some people, especially those who know themselves to be low-risk, decide against 
buying it and, instead, endure some of life’s uncertainty on their own.
Diversification of Firm-Specific Risk
In 2002, Enron, a large and once widely respected company, went bankrupt amid 
accusations of fraud and accounting irregularities. Several of the company’s top 
executives were prosecuted and ended up going to prison. The saddest part of the 
story, however, involved thousands of lower-level employees. Not only did they 
lose their jobs, but many lost their life savings as well. The employees had about 
two-thirds of their retirement funds in Enron stock, which became worthless.
If there is one piece of practical advice that finance offers to risk-averse peo-
ple, it is this: “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” You may have heard this 
before, but finance has turned this folk wisdom into a science. It goes by the name 
diversification.
The market for insurance is one example of diversification. Imagine a town 
with 10,000 homeowners, each facing the risk of a house fire. If someone starts 
an insurance company and each person in town becomes both a shareholder and 
a policyholder of the company, they all reduce their risk through diversification. 
Each person now faces 1/10,000 of the risk of 10,000 possible fires, rather than the 
entire risk of a single fire in his own home. Unless the entire town catches fire at 
the same time, the downside that each person faces is much smaller.
When people use their savings to buy financial assets, they can also reduce risk 
through diversification. A person who buys stock in a company is placing a bet 
on the future profitability of that company. That bet is often quite risky because 
companies’ fortunes are hard to predict. Microsoft evolved from a start-up by 
some geeky teenagers to one of the world’s most valuable companies in only a 
few years; Enron went from one of the world’s most respected companies to an 
almost worthless one in only a few months. Fortunately, a shareholder need not 
tie his own fortune to that of any single company. Risk can be reduced by placing 
a large number of small bets, rather than a small number of large ones.
Figure 2 shows how the risk of a portfolio of stocks depends on the number of 
stocks in the portfolio. Risk is measured here with a statistic called the standard 
deviation, which you may have learned about in a math or statistics class. The 
standard deviation measures the volatility of a variable—that is, how much the 
variable is likely to fluctuate. The higher the standard deviation of a portfolio’s 
diversification
the reduction of risk 
achieved by replacing a 
single risk with a large 
number of smaller, 
unrelated risks

return, the more volatile its return is likely to be, and the riskier it is that someone 
holding the portfolio will fail to get the return that he or she expected. 
The figure shows that the risk of a stock portfolio falls substantially as the 
number of stocks increases. For a portfolio with a single stock, the standard devia-
tion is 49 percent. Going from 1 stock to 10 stocks eliminates about half the risk. 
Going from 10 to 20 stocks reduces the risk by another 13 percent. As the number 
of stocks continues to increase, risk continues to fall, although the reductions in 
risk after 20 or 30 stocks are small.
Notice that it is impossible to eliminate all risk by increasing the number 
of stocks in the portfolio. Diversification can eliminate firm-specific risk—the 
uncertainty associated with the specific companies. But diversification cannot 
eliminate market risk—the uncertainty associated with the entire economy, 
which affects all companies traded on the stock market. For example, when the 
economy goes into a recession, most companies experience falling sales, reduced 
profit, and low stock returns. Diversification reduces the risk of holding stocks, 
but it does not eliminate it.
The Trade-off between Risk and Return
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that people face trade-offs. 
The trade-off that is most relevant for understanding financial decisions is the 
trade-off between risk and return. 
As we have seen, there are risks inherent in holding stocks, even in a diversi-
fied portfolio. But risk-averse people are willing to accept this uncertainty because 
they are compensated for doing so. Historically, stocks have offered much higher 
rates of return than alternative financial assets, such as bonds and bank savings 
accounts. Over the past two centuries, stocks offered an average real return of 
about 8 percent per year, while short-term government bonds paid a real return 
of only 3 percent per year.
When deciding how to allocate their savings, people have to decide how much 
risk they are willing to undertake to earn a higher return. For example, consider a 
person choosing how to allocate his portfolio between two asset classes: 
firm-specific risk
risk that affects only a 
single company
market risk
risk that affects all 
companies in the stock 
market
Diversification Reduces Risk
This figure shows how the risk of 
a portfolio, measured here with 
a statistic called the standard 
deviation, depends on the 
number of stocks in the portfolio. 
The investor is assumed to put an 
equal percentage of his portfolio 
in each of the stocks. Increasing 
the number of stocks reduces, but 
does not eliminate, the amount 
of risk in a stock portfolio.

• 	 The first asset class is a diversified group of risky stocks, with an average 
return of 8 percent and a standard deviation of 20 percent. (You may recall 
from a math or statistics class that a normal random variable stays within 
two standard deviations of its average about 95 percent of the time. Thus, 
while actual returns are centered around 8 percent, they typically vary from 
a gain of 48 percent to a loss of 32 percent.) 
• 	 The second asset class is a safe alternative, with a return of 3 percent and a 
standard deviation of zero. The safe alternative can be either a bank savings 
account or a government bond.
Figure 3 illustrates the trade-off between risk and return. Each point in this figure 
represents a particular allocation of a portfolio between risky stocks and the safe 
asset. The figure shows that the more the individual puts into stocks, the greater 
is both the risk and the return.
Acknowledging the risk-return trade-off does not, by itself, tell us what a per-
son should do. The choice of a particular combination of risk and return depends 
on a person’s risk aversion, which reflects a person’s own preferences. But it is 
important for stockholders to recognize that the higher average return that they 
enjoy comes at the price of higher risk.

Asset Valuation 
Now that we have developed a basic understanding of the two building blocks of 
finance—time and risk—let’s apply this knowledge. This section considers a sim-
ple question: What determines the price of a share of stock? Like most prices, the 
answer is supply and demand. But that is not the end of the story. To understand 
stock prices, we need to think more deeply about what determines a person’s 
willingness to pay for a share of stock.

Fundamental Analysis
Let’s imagine that you have decided to put 60 percent of your savings into stock, 
and to achieve diversification, you have decided to buy twenty different stocks. If 
you open up the newspaper, you will find thousands of stocks listed. How should 
you pick the twenty for your portfolio? 
When you buy stock, you are buying shares in a business. To decide which 
businesses you want to own, it is natural to consider two things: the value of that 
share of the business and the price at which the shares are being sold. If the price 
is less than the value, the stock is said to be undervalued. If the price is more than 
the value, the stock is said to be overvalued. If the price and the value are equal, the 
stock is said to be fairly valued. When choosing twenty stocks for your portfolio, 
you should prefer undervalued stocks. In these cases, you are getting a bargain by 
paying less than the business is worth.
This is easier said than done. Learning the price is easy: You can just look it up 
in the newspaper. Determining the value of the business is the hard part. The term 
fundamental analysis refers to the detailed analysis of a company to estimate its 
value. Many Wall Street firms hire stock analysts to conduct such fundamental 
analysis and offer advice about which stocks to buy.
The value of a stock to a stockholder is what he gets out of owning it, which 
includes the present value of the stream of dividend payments and the final sale 
price. Recall that dividends are the cash payments that a company makes to its 
shareholders. A company’s ability to pay dividends, as well as the value of the 
stock when the stockholder sells his shares, depends on the company’s ability to 
earn profits. Its profitability, in turn, depends on a large number of factors: the 
demand for its product, how much competition it faces, how much capital it has in 
place, whether its workers are unionized, how loyal its customers are, what kinds 
of government regulations and taxes it faces, and so on. The goal of fundamental 
analysis is to take all these factors into account to determine how much a share of 
stock in the company is worth.
If you want to rely on fundamental analysis to pick a stock portfolio, there are 
three ways to do it. One way is to do all the necessary research yourself, such as by 
reading through companies’ annual reports. A second way is to rely on the advice 
of Wall Street analysts. A third way is to buy a mutual fund, which has a manager 
who conducts fundamental analysis and makes the decision for you.
The Efficient Markets Hypothesis
There is another way to choose twenty stocks for your portfolio: Pick them ran-
domly by, for instance, putting the stock pages on your bulletin board and throwing 
darts at the page. This may sound crazy, but there is reason to believe that it won’t 
lead you too far astray. That reason is called the efficient markets hypothesis.
To understand this theory, the starting point is to acknowledge that each com-
pany listed on a major stock exchange is followed closely by many money man-
agers, such as the individuals who run mutual funds. Every day, these managers 
monitor news stories and conduct fundamental analysis to try to determine the 
stock’s value. Their job is to buy a stock when its price falls below its fundamental 
value and to sell it when its price rises above its fundamental value.
The second piece to the efficient markets hypothesis is that the equilibrium of 
supply and demand sets the market price. This means that, at the market price, 
the number of shares being offered for sale exactly equals the number of shares 
that people want to buy. In other words, at the market price, the number of peo-
ple who think the stock is overvalued exactly balances the number of people who

Betting on the  
Bad Guys 
By Scott Adams
W
hen I heard that BP was destroying a 
big portion of Earth, with no serious 
discussion of cutting their dividend, I had 
two thoughts: 1) I hate them, and 2) This 
would be an excellent time to buy their 
stock. And so I did. Although I should have 
waited a week.
	
People ask me how it feels to take the 
side of moral bankruptcy. Answer: Pretty 
good! Thanks for asking. How’s it feel to be 
a disgruntled victim?
	
I have a theory that you should invest in 
the companies that you hate the most. The 
usual reason for hating a company is that 
the company is so powerful it can make you 
balance your wallet on your nose while you 
beg for their product. Oil companies such 
as BP don’t actually make you beg for oil, 
but I think we all realize that they could. It’s 
implied in the price of gas.
	
I hate BP, but I admire them too, in the 
same way I respect the work ethic of serial 
killers. I remember the day I learned that 
BP was using a submarine . . . with a web 
cam . . . a mile under the sea . . . to feed live 
video of their disaster to the world. My mind 
screamed “STOP TRYING TO MAKE ME 
LOVE YOU! MUST . . . THINK . . . OF DEAD 
BIRDS TO MAINTAIN ANGER!” The geeky 
side of me has a bit of a crush on them, but 
I still hate them for turning Florida into a 
dip stick. . . .
	
Perhaps you think it’s absurd to invest in 
companies just because you hate them. But 
let’s compare my method to all of the other 
ways you could decide where to invest.
Technical Analysis
Technical analysis involves studying graphs 
of stock movement over time as a way to 
predict future moves. It’s a widely used 
method on Wall Street, and it has exactly 
the same scientific validity as pretending

college) offers some financial advice. 
in the news
think it’s undervalued. As judged by the typical person in the market, all stocks 
are fairly valued all the time.
According to this theory, the stock market exhibits informational efficiency: 
It reflects all available information about the value of the asset. Stock prices change 
when information changes. When good news about the company’s prospects 
becomes public, the value and the stock price both rise. When the company’s pros-
pects deteriorate, the value and price both fall. But at any moment in time, the mar-
ket price is the best guess of the company’s value based on available information.
One implication of the efficient markets hypothesis is that stock prices should 
follow a random walk. This means that the changes in stock prices are impossible 
to predict from available information. If, based on publicly available information, 
a person could predict that a stock price would rise by 10 percent tomorrow, then 
the stock market must be failing to incorporate that information today. According 
to this theory, the only thing that can move stock prices is news that changes the 
market’s perception of the company’s value. But news must be unpredictable—
otherwise, it wouldn’t really be news. For the same reason, changes in stock prices 
should be unpredictable. 
If the efficient markets hypothesis is correct, then there is little point in spend-
ing many hours studying the business page to decide which twenty stocks to add 
to your portfolio. If prices reflect all available information, no stock is a better buy 
than any other. The best you can do is buy a diversified portfolio.

you are a witch and forecasting market 
moves from chicken droppings.
Investing in Well-Managed 
Companies
When companies make money, we assume 
they are well-managed. That perception 
is reinforced by the CEOs of those com-
panies who are happy to tell you all the 
clever things they did to make it happen. 
The problem with relying on this source of 
information is that CEOs are highly skilled 
in a special form of lying called leadership. 
Leadership involves convincing employees 
and investors that the CEO has something 
called a vision, a type of optimistic hal-
lucination that can come true only in an 
environment in which the CEO is massively 
overcompensated and the employees have 
learned to be less selfish.
Track Record
Perhaps you can safely invest in companies 
that have a long track record of being prof-
itable. That sounds safe and reasonable, 
right? The problem is that every investment 
expert knows two truths about investing: 
1)  Past performance is no indication of 
future performance. 2) You need to consider 
a company’s track record.
	
Right, yes, those are opposites. And it’s 
pretty much all that anyone knows about 
investing. An investment professional can 
argue for any sort of investment decision by 
selectively ignoring either point 1 or 2. And 
for that you will pay the investment profes-
sional 1% to 2% of your portfolio value 
annually, no matter the performance.
Invest in Companies You Love
Instead of investing in companies you hate, 
as I have suggested, perhaps you could 
invest in companies you love. I once hired 
professional money managers at Wells 
Fargo to do essentially that for me. As part 
of their service they promised to listen to the 
dopey-happy hallucinations of professional 
liars (CEOs) and be gullible on my behalf. 
The pros at Wells Fargo bought for my 
portfolio Enron, WorldCom, and a number 
of other much-loved companies that soon 
went out of business. For that, I hate Wells 
Fargo. But I sure wish I had bought stock 
in Wells Fargo at the time I hated them the 
most, because Wells Fargo itself performed 
great. See how this works?
Do Your Own Research
I didn’t let Wells Fargo manage my entire 
portfolio, thanks to my native distrust of all 
humanity. For the other half of my portfolio 
I did my own research. (Imagine a field of 
red flags, all wildly waving. I didn’t notice 
them.) My favorite investment was in a 
company I absolutely loved. I loved their 
business model. I loved their mission. I loved 
how they planned to make our daily lives 
easier. They were simply adorable as they 
struggled to change an entrenched industry. 
Their leaders reported that the company had 
finally turned cash positive in one key area, 
thus validating their business model, and 
proving that the future was rosy. I doubled 
down. The company was Webvan, may it 
rest in peace.

you not to make investment decisions based 
on the wisdom of cartoonists.)

Random Walks and Index Funds
The efficient markets hypothesis is a theory about how financial markets work.  
The theory is probably not completely true: As we discuss in the next section, 
there is reason to doubt that stockholders are always rational and that stock prices 
are informationally efficient at every moment. Nonetheless, the efficient markets 
hypothesis does much better as a description of the world than you might think.
	
There is much evidence that stock prices, even if not exactly a random walk, 
are very close to it. For example, you might be tempted to buy stocks that have 
recently risen and avoid stocks that have recently fallen (or perhaps just the 
­opposite). But statistical studies have shown that following such trends (or buck-
ing them) fails to outperform the market. The correlation between how well a 
stock does one year and how well it does the following year is almost exactly zero.
	
Some of the best evidence in favor of the efficient markets hypothesis comes 
from the performance of index funds. An index fund is a mutual fund that buys 
all the stocks in a given stock index. The performance of these funds can be com-
pared with that of actively managed mutual funds, where a professional port­
folio manager picks stocks based on extensive research and alleged expertise. In

essence, an index fund buys all stocks, whereas active funds are supposed to buy 
only the best stocks.
	
In practice, active managers usually fail to beat index funds. For example, in 
the fifteen years ending June 2010, 75 percent of stock mutual funds performed 
worse than a broadly based index fund holding all stocks traded on U.S. stock 
exchanges. Over this period, the average annual return on stock funds fell short 
of the return on the index fund by 1.25 percentage points. Most active portfolio 
managers failed to beat the market because they trade more frequently, incurring 
Efficient Market 
Theory and the Crisis 
By Jeremy Siegel
F
inancial journalist and best-selling author 
Roger Lowenstein didn’t mince words in 
a piece for the Washington Post this summer: 
“The upside of the current Great Recession is 
that it could drive a stake through the heart 
of the academic nostrum known as the effi-
cient-market hypothesis.” In a similar vein, 
the highly respected money manager and 
financial analyst Jeremy Grantham wrote 
in his quarterly letter last January: “The 
incredibly inaccurate efficient market theory 
[caused] a lethally dangerous combination of 
asset bubbles, lax controls, pernicious incen-
tives and wickedly complicated instruments 
[that] led to our current plight.”
	
But is the Efficient Market Hypothesis 
(EMH) really responsible for the current 
crisis? The answer is no. The EMH, originally 
put forth by Eugene Fama of the University 
of Chicago in the 1960s, states that the 
prices of securities reflect all known infor-
mation that impacts their value. The hypoth-
esis does not claim that the market price is 
always right. On the contrary, it implies that 
the prices in the market are mostly wrong, 
but at any given moment it is not at all easy 
to say whether they are too high or too low. 
The fact that the best and brightest on Wall 
Street made so many mistakes shows how 
hard it is to beat the market.
	
This does not mean the EMH can be 
used as an excuse by the CEOs of the failed 
financial firms or by the regulators who did 
not see the risks that subprime mortgage-
backed securities posed to the financial 
stability of the economy. Regulators wrongly 
believed that financial firms were offsetting 
their credit risks, while the banks and credit 
rating agencies were fooled by faulty models 
that underestimated the risk in real estate. 
	
After the 1982 recession, the U.S. and 
world economies entered into a long period 
where the fluctuations in variables such as 
gross domestic product, industrial produc-
tion, and employment were significantly 
 Is the Efficient Markets Hypothesis Kaput?
In 2008 and 2009, the U.S. economy experienced a financial crisis that 
started with a substantial decline in house prices and widespread defaults 
on mortgages. Some observers say the crisis should cause us to reject the 
efficient market hypothesis. Economist Jeremy Siegel is not convinced.

more trading costs, and because they charge greater fees as compensation for their 
alleged expertise.
	
What about the 25 percent of managers who did beat the market? Perhaps they 
are smarter than average, or perhaps they were luckier. If you have 5,000 people 
flipping coins ten times, on average about five will flip ten heads; these five might 
claim an exceptional coin-flipping skill, but they would have trouble replicating 
the feat. Similarly, studies have shown that mutual fund managers with a history 
of superior performance usually fail to maintain it in subsequent periods.
	
The Wall Street Journal published an example of this phenomenon on January 
3, 2008. The paper reported that of the many thousands of mutual funds sold 
to the public, only thirty-one beat the Standard & Poor’s 500 index in each of 
the eight years from 1999 to 2006. A skeptic of the efficient markets hypothesis 
might think that, subsequently, these highly performing funds would offer a 
better-­than-average place to invest. In 2007, however, only fourteen of these thirty-
one outperformed the index—about what would be expected from sheer chance. 
Exceptional past performance appears to give little reason to expect future success.
	
The efficient markets hypothesis says that it is impossible to beat the market. 
The accumulation of many studies in financial markets confirms that beating the 
market is, at best, extremely difficult. Even if the efficient markets hypothesis is 
not an exact description of the world, it contains a large element of truth.  ■
lower than they had been since World War 
II. Economists called this period the “Great 
Moderation” and attributed the increased 
stability to better monetary policy, a larger 
service sector and better inventory control, 
among other factors.
	
The economic response to the Great 
Moderation was predictable: risk premiums 
shrank and individuals and firms took on 
more leverage. Housing prices were boosted 
by historically low nominal and real interest 
rates and the development of the securitized 
subprime lending market. 
	
According to data collected by Prof. 
Robert Shiller of Yale University, in the 
61 years from 1945 through 2006 the 
maximum cumulative decline in the average 
price of homes was 2.84% in 1991. If this 
low volatility of home prices persisted into 
the future, a mortgage security composed 
of a nationally diversified portfolio of loans 
comprising the first 80% of a home’s value 
would have never come close to default-
ing. The credit quality of home buyers was 
secondary because it was thought that 
underlying collateral—the home—could 
always cover the principal in the event 
the ­homeowner defaulted. These models 
led credit agencies to rate these subprime 
mortgages as “investment grade.”
	
But this assessment was faulty. From 
2000 through 2006, national home prices 
rose by 88.7%, far more than the 17.5% 
gain in the consumer price index or the 
paltry 1% rise in median household income. 
Never before have home prices jumped that 
far ahead of prices and incomes. 
	
This should have sent up red flags and 
cast doubts on using models that looked only 
at historical declines to judge future risk. But 
these flags were ignored as Wall Street was 
reaping large profits bundling and selling the 
securities while Congress was happy that 
more Americans could enjoy the “American 
Dream” of home ownership. Indeed, through 
government-sponsored enterprises such as 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Washington 
helped fuel the subprime boom.
	
Neither the rating agencies’ mistakes 
nor the overleveraging by the financial firms 
in the subprime securities is the fault of 
the Efficient Market Hypothesis. The fact 
that the yields on these mortgages were 
high despite their investment-grade rating 
indicated that the market was rightly suspi-
cious of the quality of the securities, and this 
should have served as a warning to prospec-
tive buyers. 
	
With few exceptions (Goldman Sachs 
being one), financial firms ignored these warn-
ings. CEOs failed to exercise their authority to 
monitor overall risk of the firm and instead 
put their faith in technicians whose narrow 
models could not capture the big picture. . . . 
	
Our crisis wasn’t due to blind faith in the 
Efficient Market Hypothesis. The fact that 
risk premiums were low does not mean they 
were nonexistent and that market prices 
were right. Despite the recent recession, the 
Great Moderation is real and our economy 
is inherently more stable. 
	
But this does not mean that risks have 
disappeared. To use an analogy, the fact that 
automobiles today are safer than they were 
years ago does not mean that you can drive 
at 120 mph. A small bump on the road, per-
haps insignificant at lower speeds, will easily 
flip the best-engineered car. Our financial 
firms drove too fast, our central bank failed 
to stop them, and the housing deflation 
crashed the banks and the economy.

Market Irrationality 
The efficient markets hypothesis assumes that people buying and selling stock 
rationally process the information they have about the stock’s underlying value. 
But is the stock market really that rational? Or do stock prices sometimes deviate 
from reasonable expectations of their true value?
There is a long tradition suggesting that fluctuations in stock prices are partly 
psychological. In the 1930s, economist John Maynard Keynes suggested that asset 
markets are driven by the “animal spirits” of investors—irrational waves of opti-
mism and pessimism. In the 1990s, as the stock market soared to new heights, 
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan questioned whether the boom reflected “irrational 
exuberance.” Stock prices did subsequently fall, but whether the exuberance of 
the 1990s was irrational given the information available at the time remains debat-
able. Whenever the price of an asset rises above what appears to be its fundamen-
tal value, the market is said to be experiencing a speculative bubble.
The possibility of speculative bubbles in the stock market arises in part because 
the value of the stock to a stockholder depends not only on the stream of dividend 
payments but also on the final sale price. Thus, a person might be willing to pay 
more than a stock is worth today if she expects another person to pay even more for 
it tomorrow. When you evaluate a stock, you have to estimate not only the value of 
the business but also what other people will think the business is worth in the future.
There is much debate among economists about the frequency and importance 
of departures from rational pricing. Believers in market irrationality point out 
(correctly) that the stock market often moves in ways that are hard to explain on 
the basis of news that might alter a rational valuation. Believers in the efficient 
markets hypothesis point out (correctly) that it is impossible to know the correct, 
rational valuation of a company, so one should not quickly jump to the conclusion 
that any particular valuation is irrational. Moreover, if the market were irrational, 
a rational person should be able to take advantage of this fact; yet as the previous 
case study discussed, beating the market is nearly impossible.
Quick Quiz  Fortune magazine regularly publishes a list of the “most respected” 
companies. According to the efficient markets hypothesis, if you restrict your stock 
portfolio to these companies, will you earn a better than average return? Explain.
Conclusion
This chapter has developed some of the basic tools that people should (and often 
do) use as they make financial decisions. The concept of present value reminds us 
that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and it gives us a way 
to compare sums of money at different points in time. The theory of risk manage-
ment reminds us that the future is uncertain and that risk-averse people can take 
precautions to guard against this uncertainty. The study of asset valuation tells us 
that the stock price of any company should reflect its expected future profitability.
Although most of the tools of finance are well established, there is more con-
troversy about the validity of the efficient markets hypothesis and whether stock 
prices are, in practice, rational estimates of a company’s true worth. Rational or 
not, the large movements in stock prices that we observe have important macro­
economic implications. Stock market fluctuations often go hand in hand with 
fluctuations in the economy more broadly. We revisit the stock market when we 
study economic fluctuations later in the book.

Questions for Review
Problems and Applications
Key Concepts
Summary
• Because savings can earn interest, a sum of 
money today is more valuable than the same 
sum of money in the future. A person can 
compare sums from different times using the 
concept of present value. The present value of 
any future sum is the amount that would be 
needed today, given prevailing interest rates, to 
produce that future sum.
• Because of diminishing marginal utility, most 
people are risk averse. Risk-averse people can 
reduce risk by buying insurance, diversifying 
their holdings, and choosing a portfolio with 
lower risk and lower return. 
• The value of an asset equals the present value 
of the cash flows the owner will receive. For 
a share of stock, these cash flows include the 
stream of dividends and the final sale price. 
According to the efficient markets hypothesis, 
financial markets process available information 
rationally, so a stock price always equals the 
best estimate of the value of the underlying 
business. Some economists question the efficient 
markets hypothesis, however, and believe that 
irrational psychological factors also influence 
asset prices.

companies? What might be the disadvantage 
of buying stock in these companies?
	 9. 	When company executives buy and sell stock 
based on private information they obtain as part 
of their jobs, they are engaged in insider trading.
a.	 Give an example of inside information that 
might be useful for buying or selling stock.
b.	Those who trade stocks based on inside 
information usually earn very high rates of 
return. Does this fact violate the efficient 
markets hypothesis?
c.	 Insider trading is illegal. Why do you 
suppose that is?
	10.	 Jamal has a utility function U = W1/2, where 
W is his wealth in millions of dollars (which 
determines how much he gets to buy and 
consume over his lifetime) and U is the utility 
he obtains.
a.	 Graph Jamal’s utility function. Is he risk 
averse? Explain.
b.	In the final stage of a game show, the host 
offers Jamal a choice between (A) $4 million 
for sure, or (B) a gamble that pays $1 million 
with probability 0.6 and $9 million with 
probability 0.4. Should Jamal pick A or B? 
Explain you reasoning with appropriate 
calculations. (Hint: The expected value of a 
random variable is the weighted average of 
the possible outcomes, where the probabilities 
are the weights.)
