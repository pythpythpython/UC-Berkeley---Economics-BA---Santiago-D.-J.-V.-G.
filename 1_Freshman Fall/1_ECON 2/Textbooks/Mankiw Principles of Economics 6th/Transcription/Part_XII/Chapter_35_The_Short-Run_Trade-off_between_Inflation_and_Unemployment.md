The Short-Run Trade-off  
    between Inflation and
 ­    Unemployment
T
wo closely watched indicators of economic performance are inflation 
and unemployment. When the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases data 
on these variables each month, policymakers are eager to hear the news. 
Some commentators have added together the inflation rate and the 
unemployment rate to produce a misery index, which purports to measure the 
health of the economy. 
How are these two measures of economic performance related to each other? 
Earlier in the book, we discussed the long-run determinants of unemployment and 
the long-run determinants of inflation. We saw that the natural rate of unemploy-
ment depends on various features of the labor market, such as minimum-wage

laws, the market power of unions, the role of efficiency wages, and the effective-
ness of job search. By contrast, the inflation rate depends primarily on growth in 
the money supply, which a nation’s central bank controls. In the long run, there-
fore, inflation and unemployment are largely unrelated problems.
In the short run, just the opposite is true. One of the Ten Principles of Economics 
discussed in Chapter 1 is that society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation 
and unemployment. If monetary and fiscal policymakers expand aggregate demand 
and move the economy up along the short-run aggregate-supply curve, they can 
expand output and lower unemployment for a while, but only at the cost of a more 
rapidly rising price level. If policymakers contract aggregate demand and move the 
economy down the short-run aggregate-supply curve, they can lower inflation, but 
only at the cost of temporarily lower output and higher unemployment.
In this chapter, we examine the inflation–unemployment trade-off more closely. 
The relationship between inflation and unemployment has attracted the attention 
of some of the most important economists of the last half century. The best way 
to understand this relationship is to see how thinking about it has evolved. As we 
will see, the history of thought regarding inflation and unemployment since the 
1950s is inextricably connected to the history of the U.S. economy. These two his-
tories will show why the trade-off between inflation and unemployment holds in 
the short run, why it does not hold in the long run, and what issues the trade-off 
raises for economic policymakers. 
The Phillips Curve
“Probably the single most important macroeconomic relationship is the Phillips 
curve.” These are the words of economist George Akerlof from the lecture he gave 
when he received the Nobel Prize in 2001. The Phillips curve is the short-run 
relationship between inflation and unemployment. We begin our story with the 
discovery of the Phillips curve and its migration to America.
Origins of the Phillips Curve
In 1958, economist A. W. Phillips published an article in the British journal Economica 
that would make him famous. The article was titled “The Relationship between 
Unemployment and the Rate of Change of Money Wages in the United Kingdom, 
1861–1957.” In it, Phillips showed a negative correlation between the rate of unem-
ployment and the rate of inflation. That is, Phillips showed that years with low 
unemployment tend to have high inflation, and years with high ­unemployment 
tend to have low inflation. (Phillips examined inflation in nominal wages rather 
than inflation in prices, but for our purposes, that distinction is not important. 
These two measures of inflation usually move together.) Phillips concluded that 
two important macroeconomic variables—inflation and ­unemployment—were 
linked in a way that economists had not previously appreciated.
Although Phillips’s discovery was based on data for the United Kingdom, 
researchers quickly extended his finding to other countries. Two years after 
Phillips published his article, economists Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow 
published an article in the American Economic Review called “Analytics of Anti-
Inflation Policy” in which they showed a similar negative correlation between 
inflation and unemployment in data for the United States. They reasoned that this 
correlation arose because low unemployment was associated with high aggregate

demand, which in turn puts upward pressure on wages and prices throughout the 
economy. Samuelson and Solow dubbed the negative association between infla-
tion and unemployment the Phillips curve. Figure 1 shows an example of a Phillips 
curve like the one found by Samuelson and Solow.
As the title of their paper suggests, Samuelson and Solow were interested in the 
Phillips curve because they believed it held important lessons for policymakers. In 
particular, they suggested that the Phillips curve offers policymakers a menu of 
possible economic outcomes. By altering monetary and fiscal policy to influence 
aggregate demand, policymakers could choose any point on this curve. Point A 
offers high unemployment and low inflation. Point B offers low unemployment 
and high inflation. Policymakers might prefer both low inflation and low unem-
ployment, but the historical data as summarized by the Phillips curve indicate 
that this combination is impossible. According to Samuelson and Solow, policy-
makers face a trade-off between inflation and unemployment, and the Phillips 
curve illustrates that trade-off.
Aggregate Demand, Aggregate Supply, and  
the Phillips Curve
The model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply provides an easy expla-
nation for the menu of possible outcomes described by the Phillips curve. The 
Phillips curve shows the combinations of inflation and unemployment that arise in the 
short run as shifts in the aggregate-demand curve move the economy along the short-run 
aggregate-supply curve. As we saw in the preceding two chapters, an increase in the 
aggregate demand for goods and services leads, in the short run, to a larger out-
put of goods and services and a higher price level. Larger output means greater 
employment and, thus, a lower rate of unemployment. In addition, a higher price 
level translates into a higher rate of inflation. Thus, shifts in aggregate demand 
push inflation and unemployment in opposite directions in the short run—a rela-
tionship illustrated by the Phillips curve.
To see more fully how this works, let’s consider an example. To keep the 
numbers simple, imagine that the price level (as measured, for instance, by the 
consumer price index) equals 100 in the year 2020. Figure 2 shows two possible

This figure assumes a price level of 100 for the year 2020 and charts possible outcomes 
for the year 2021. Panel (a) shows the model of aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply. If aggregate demand is low, the economy is at point A; output is low (15,000), 
and the price level is low (102). If aggregate demand is high, the economy is at 
point B; output is high (16,000), and the price level is high (106). Panel (b) shows the 
implications for the Phillips curve. Point A, which arises when aggregate demand is 
low, has high unemployment (7 percent) and low inflation (2 percent). Point B, which 
arises when aggregate demand is high, has low unemployment (4 percent) and high 
inflation (6 percent).

outcomes that might occur in the year 2021 depending of the strength of aggregate 
demand. One outcome occurs if aggregate demand is high, and the other occurs 
if aggregate demand is low. Panel (a) shows these two outcomes using the model 
of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Panel (b) illustrates the same two 
outcomes using the Phillips curve.
Panel (a) of the figure shows what happens to output and the price level in the 
year 2021. If the aggregate demand for goods and services is low, the economy 
experiences outcome A. The economy produces output of 15,000, and the price 
level is 102. By contrast, if aggregate demand is high, the economy experiences 
outcome B. Output is 16,000, and the price level is 106. This is just an example of 
a familiar conclusion: Higher aggregate demand moves the economy to an equi-
librium with higher output and a higher price level.
Panel (b) shows what these two possible outcomes mean for unemployment 
and inflation. Because firms need more workers when they produce a greater out-
put of goods and services, unemployment is lower in outcome B than in outcome 
A. In this example, when output rises from 15,000 to 16,000, unemployment falls 
from 7 percent to 4 percent. Moreover, because the price level is higher at out-
come B than at outcome A, the inflation rate (the percentage change in the price 
level from the previous year) is also higher. In particular, since the price level was 
100 in the year 2020, outcome A has an inflation rate of 2 percent, and outcome 
B has an inflation rate of 6 percent. The two possible outcomes for the economy 
can be compared either in terms of output and the price level (using the model

of ­aggregate demand and aggregate supply) or in terms of unemployment and 
inflation (using the Phillips curve). 
Because monetary and fiscal policy can shift the aggregate-demand curve, they 
can move an economy along the Phillips curve. Increases in the money supply, 
increases in government spending, or cuts in taxes expand aggregate demand and 
move the economy to a point on the Phillips curve with lower unemployment and 
higher inflation. Decreases in the money supply, cuts in government spending, or 
increases in taxes contract aggregate demand and move the economy to a point on 
the Phillips curve with lower inflation and higher unemployment. In this sense, 
the Phillips curve offers policymakers a menu of combinations of inflation and 
unemployment.

Shifts in the Phillips Curve: The Role of Expectations
The Phillips curve seems to offer policymakers a menu of possible inflation–
unemployment outcomes. But does this menu of choices remain the same over 
time? Is the downward-sloping Phillips curve a stable relationship on which poli-
cymakers can rely? Economists took up these questions in the late 1960s, shortly 
after Samuelson and Solow had introduced the Phillips curve into the macroeco-
nomic policy debate.
The Long-Run Phillips Curve
In 1968, economist Milton Friedman published a paper in the American Economic 
Review based on an address he had recently given as president of the American 
Economic Association. The paper, titled “The Role of Monetary Policy,” contained 
sections on “What Monetary Policy Can Do” and “What Monetary Policy Cannot 
Do.” Friedman argued that one thing monetary policy cannot do, other than for 
only a short time, is lower unemployment by raising inflation. At about the same 
time, another economist, Edmund Phelps, also published a paper denying the 
existence of a long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment.
Friedman and Phelps based their conclusions on classical principles of macro­
economics. Classical theory points to growth in the money supply as the primary 
determinant of inflation. But classical theory also states that monetary growth 
does not affect real variables such as output and employment; it merely alters all 
prices and nominal incomes proportionately. In particular, monetary growth does 
not influence those factors that determine the economy’s unemployment rate, 
such as the market power of unions, the role of efficiency wages, or the process of 
job search. Friedman and Phelps concluded that there is no reason to think that the 
rate of inflation would, in the long run, be related to the rate of unemployment.
Here, in his own words, is Friedman’s view about what the Federal Reserve can 
hope to accomplish for the economy in the long run:
The monetary authority controls nominal quantities—directly, the quantity 
of its own liabilities [currency plus bank reserves]. In principle, it can use 
this control to peg a nominal quantity—an exchange rate, the price level, the

nominal level of national income, the quantity of money by one definition 
or another—or to peg the change in a nominal quantity—the rate of infla-
tion or deflation, the rate of growth or decline in nominal national income, 
the rate of growth of the quantity of money. It cannot use its control over 
nominal quantities to peg a real quantity—the real rate of interest, the rate of 
unemployment, the level of real national income, the real quantity of money, 
the rate of growth of real national income, or the rate of growth of the real 
quantity of money.
These views have important implications for the Phillips curve. In particular, they 
imply that monetary policymakers face a long-run Phillips curve that is vertical, 
as in Figure 3. If the Fed increases the money supply slowly, the inflation rate 
is low, and the economy finds itself at point A. If the Fed increases the money 
supply quickly, the inflation rate is high, and the economy finds itself at point B. 
In either case, the unemployment rate tends toward its normal level, called the 
natural rate of unemployment. The vertical long-run Phillips curve illustrates the 
conclusion that unemployment does not depend on money growth and inflation 
in the long run.
The vertical long-run Phillips curve is, in essence, one expression of the clas-
sical idea of monetary neutrality. Previously, we expressed monetary neutrality 
with a vertical long-run aggregate-supply curve. Figure 4 shows that the vertical 
long-run Phillips curve and the vertical long-run aggregate-supply curve are two 
sides of the same coin. In panel (a) of this figure, an increase in the money supply 
shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right from AD1 to AD2. As a result of this 
shift, the long-run equilibrium moves from point A to point B. The price level rises 
from P1 to P2, but because the aggregate-supply curve is vertical, output remains 
the same. In panel (b), more rapid growth in the money supply raises the infla-
tion rate by moving the economy from point A to point B. But because the Phillips 
curve is vertical, the rate of unemployment is the same at these two points. Thus, 
the vertical long-run aggregate-supply curve and the vertical long-run Phillips 
curve both imply that monetary policy influences nominal variables (the price 
level and the inflation rate) but not real variables (output and unemployment). 
Figure 3
The Long-Run Phillips Curve
According to Friedman and Phelps, 
there is no trade-off between 
inflation and unemployment in 
the long run. Growth in the money 
supply determines the inflation rate. 
Regardless of the inflation rate, the 
unemployment rate gravitates toward 
its natural rate. As a result, the long-
run Phillips curve is vertical.

Panel (b) shows the long-run Phillips curve, which is vertical at the natural rate of 
unemployment. In the long run, expansionary monetary policy moves the economy 
from lower inflation (point A) to higher inflation (point B) without changing the rate

The Meaning of “Natural”
What is so “natural” about the natural rate of unemployment? Friedman and 
Phelps used this adjective to describe the unemployment rate toward which the 
economy gravitates in the long run. Yet the natural rate of unemployment is not 
necessarily the socially desirable rate of unemployment. Nor is the natural rate of 
unemployment constant over time. 
For example, suppose that a newly formed union uses its market power to 
raise the real wages of some workers above the equilibrium level. The result is an 
excess supply of workers and, therefore, a higher natural rate of unemployment. 
This unemployment is natural not because it is good but because it is beyond the 
influence of monetary policy. More rapid money growth would reduce neither 
the market power of the union nor the level of unemployment; it would lead only 
to more inflation.
Although monetary policy cannot influence the natural rate of unemployment, 
other types of policy can. To reduce the natural rate of unemployment, policy-
makers should look to policies that improve the functioning of the labor market. 
Earlier in the book, we discussed how various labor-market policies, such as 
minimum-wage laws, collective-bargaining laws, unemployment insurance, and

job-training programs, affect the natural rate of unemployment. A policy change 
that reduced the natural rate of unemployment would shift the long-run Phillips 
curve to the left. In addition, because lower unemployment means more workers 
are producing goods and services, the quantity of goods and services supplied 
would be larger at any given price level, and the long-run aggregate-supply curve 
would shift to the right. The economy could then enjoy lower unemployment and 
higher output for any given rate of money growth and inflation. 
Reconciling Theory and Evidence
At first, the conclusion of Friedman and Phelps that there is no long-run trade-off 
between inflation and unemployment might not seem persuasive. Their argu-
ment was based on an appeal to theory, specifically classical theory’s prediction of 
monetary neutrality. By contrast, the negative correlation between inflation and 
unemployment documented by Phillips, Samuelson, and Solow was based on 
actual evidence from the real world. Why should anyone believe that policymak-
ers faced a vertical Phillips curve when the world seemed to offer a downward-
sloping one? Shouldn’t the findings of Phillips, Samuelson, and Solow lead us to 
reject monetary neutrality?
Friedman and Phelps were well aware of these questions, and they offered a 
way to reconcile classical macroeconomic theory with the finding of a downward-
sloping Phillips curve in data from the United Kingdom and the United States. 
They claimed that a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment 
exists in the short run but that it cannot be used by policymakers as a menu of out-
comes in the long run. Policymakers can pursue expansionary monetary policy to 
achieve lower unemployment for a while, but eventually, unemployment returns 
to its natural rate, and more expansionary monetary policy leads only to higher 
inflation.
Friedman’s and Phelps’s work was the basis of our discussion of the difference 
between the short-run and long-run aggregate-supply curves in Chapter     . As 
you may recall, the long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical, indicating that 
the price level does not influence quantity supplied in the long run. But the short-
run aggregate-supply curve is upward sloping, indicating that an increase in the 
price level raises the quantity of goods and services that firms supply. According 
to the sticky-wage theory of aggregate supply, for instance, nominal wages are set 
in advance based on the price level that workers and firms expected to prevail. 
When prices come in higher than expected, firms have an incentive to increase 
production and employment; when prices are less than expected, firms reduce 
production and employment. Yet because the expected price level and nominal 
wages will eventually adjust, the positive relationship between the actual price 
level and quantity supplied exists only in the short run.
Friedman and Phelps applied this same logic to the Phillips curve. Just as 
the aggregate-supply curve slopes upward only in the short run, the trade-off 
between inflation and unemployment holds only in the short run. And just as the 
long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical, the long-run Phillips curve is also 
vertical. Once again, expectations are the key for understanding how the short run 
and the long run are related.
Friedman and Phelps introduced a new variable into the analysis of the 
­inflation–unemployment trade-off: expected inflation. Expected inflation measures 
how much people expect the overall price level to change. Because the expected 
price level affects nominal wages, expected inflation is one factor that determines

the position of the short-run aggregate-supply curve. In the short run, the Fed 
can take expected inflation (and, thus, the short-run aggregate-supply curve) as 
already determined. When the money supply changes, the aggregate-demand 
curve shifts, and the economy moves along a given short-run aggregate-supply 
curve. In the short run, therefore, monetary changes lead to unexpected fluctua-
tions in output, prices, unemployment, and inflation. In this way, Friedman and 
Phelps explained the downward-sloping Phillips curve that Phillips, Samuelson, 
and Solow had documented. 
The Fed’s ability to create unexpected inflation by increasing the money sup-
ply exists only in the short run. In the long run, people come to expect what-
ever inflation rate the Fed chooses to produce, and nominal wages will adjust 
to keep pace with inflation. As a result, the long-run aggregate-supply curve 
is vertical. Changes in aggregate demand, such as those due to changes in the 
money supply, affect neither the economy’s output of goods and services nor 
the number of workers that firms need to hire to produce those goods and ser­
vices. Friedman and Phelps concluded that unemployment returns to its natural 
rate in the long run.
The Short-Run Phillips Curve
The analysis of Friedman and Phelps can be summarized in the following equa-
tion:
	
Unemployment  =  Natural rate of   –  a	
Actual 	   – 	 Expected   .
	
rate	
unemployment	
inflation	
inflation
This equation (which is, in essence, another expression of the aggregate-supply 
equation we have seen previously) relates the unemployment rate to the natural 
rate of unemployment, actual inflation, and expected inflation. In the short run, 
expected inflation is given, so higher actual inflation is associated with lower 
unemployment. (The variable a is a parameter that measures how much unem-
ployment responds to unexpected inflation.) In the long run, people come to 
expect whatever inflation the Fed produces, so actual inflation equals expected 
inflation, and unemployment is at its natural rate.
This equation implies there can be no stable short-run Phillips curve. Each 
short-run Phillips curve reflects a particular expected rate of inflation. (To be pre-
cise, if you graph the equation, you’ll find that the downward-sloping short-run 
Phillips curve intersects the vertical long-run Phillips curve at the expected rate 
of inflation.) When expected inflation changes, the short-run Phillips curve shifts.
According to Friedman and Phelps, it is dangerous to view the Phillips curve 
as a menu of options available to policymakers. To see why, imagine an economy 
that starts with low inflation, with an equally low rate of expected inflation, and 
with unemployment at its natural rate. In Figure 5, the economy is at point A. 
Now suppose that policymakers try to take advantage of the trade-off between 
inflation and unemployment by using monetary or fiscal policy to expand aggre-
gate demand. In the short run, when expected inflation is given, the economy 
goes from point A to point B. Unemployment falls below its natural rate, and the 
actual inflation rate rises above expected inflation. As the economy moves from 
point A to point B, policymakers might think they have achieved permanently 
lower unemployment at the cost of higher inflation—a bargain that, if possible, 
might be worth making.

How Expected Inflation Shifts the 
Short-Run Phillips Curve
The higher the expected rate of inflation, 
the higher the short-run trade-off 
between inflation and unemployment. 
At point A, expected inflation and actual 
inflation are equal at a low rate, and 
unemployment is at its natural rate. If the 
Fed pursues an expansionary monetary 
policy, the economy moves from point A 
to point B in the short run. At point B, 
expected inflation is still low, but actual 
inflation is high. Unemployment is below 
its natural rate. In the long run, expected 
inflation rises, and the economy moves 
to point C. At point C, expected inflation 
and actual inflation are both high, and 
unemployment is back to its natural rate.

This situation, however, will not persist. Over time, people get used to this 
higher inflation rate, and they raise their expectations of inflation. When expected 
inflation rises, firms and workers start taking higher inflation into account when 
setting wages and prices. The short-run Phillips curve then shifts to the right, as 
shown in the figure. The economy ends up at point C, with higher inflation than 
at point A but with the same level of unemployment. Thus, Friedman and Phelps 
concluded that policymakers face only a temporary trade-off between inflation 
and unemployment. In the long run, expanding aggregate demand more rapidly 
will yield higher inflation without any reduction in unemployment.
The Natural Experiment for the Natural-Rate 
Hypothesis
Friedman and Phelps had made a bold prediction in 1968: If policymakers try 
to take advantage of the Phillips curve by choosing higher inflation to reduce 
unemployment, they will succeed at reducing unemployment only temporarily. 
This view—that unemployment eventually returns to its natural rate, regardless 
of the rate of inflation—is called the natural-rate hypothesis. A few years after 
Friedman and Phelps proposed this hypothesis, monetary and fiscal policymak-
ers inadvertently created a natural experiment to test it. Their laboratory was the 
U.S. economy.
Before we see the outcome of this test, however, let’s look at the data that 
Friedman and Phelps had when they made their prediction in 1968. Figure 6 
shows the unemployment and inflation rates for the period from 1961 to 1968. 
These data trace out an almost perfect Phillips curve. As inflation rose over these 
eight years, unemployment fell. The economic data from this era seemed to con-
firm that policymakers faced a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. 
The apparent success of the Phillips curve in the 1960s made the prediction of 
Friedman and Phelps all the bolder. In 1958, Phillips had suggested a negative 
natural-rate 
hypothesis
the claim that 
unemployment eventually 
returns to its normal, or 
natural, rate, regardless of 
the rate of inflation

association between inflation and unemployment. In 1960, Samuelson and Solow 
had shown it existed in U.S. data. Another decade of data had confirmed the rela-
tionship. To some economists at the time, it seemed ridiculous to claim that the 
historically reliable Phillips curve would start shifting once policymakers tried to 
take advantage of it.
In fact, that is exactly what happened. Beginning in the late 1960s, the gov-
ernment followed policies that expanded the aggregate demand for goods and 
services. In part, this expansion was due to fiscal policy: Government spend-
ing rose as the Vietnam War heated up. In part, it was due to monetary policy: 
Because the Fed was trying to hold down interest rates in the face of expansion-
ary fiscal policy, the money supply (as measured by M2) rose about 13 percent 
per year during the period from 1970 to 1972, compared to 7 percent per year in 
the early 1960s. As a result, inflation stayed high (about 5 to 6 percent per year 
in the late 1960s and early 1970s, compared to about 1 to 2 percent per year in 
the early 1960s). But as Friedman and Phelps had predicted, unemployment did 
not stay low.
Figure 7 displays the history of inflation and unemployment from 1961 to 1973. 
It shows that the simple negative relationship between these two variables started 
to break down around 1970. In particular, as inflation remained high in the early 
1970s, people’s expectations of inflation caught up with reality, and the unem-
ployment rate reverted to the 5 percent to 6 percent range that had prevailed in 
the early 1960s. Notice that the history illustrated in Figure 7 resembles the theory 
of a shifting short-run Phillips curve shown in Figure 5. By 1973, policymakers 
had learned that Friedman and Phelps were right: There is no trade-off between 
inflation and unemployment in the long run.

Shifts in the Phillips Curve: The Role of Supply Shocks
Friedman and Phelps had suggested in 1968 that changes in expected inflation 
shift the short-run Phillips curve, and the experience of the early 1970s convinced 
most economists that Friedman and Phelps were right. Within a few years, how-
ever, the economics profession would turn its attention to a different source of 
shifts in the short-run Phillips curve: shocks to aggregate supply. 
This time, the change in focus came not from two American economics pro-
fessors but from a group of Arab sheiks. In 1974, the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC) began to exert its market power as a cartel in the 
world oil market to increase its members’ profits. The countries of OPEC, such as 
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq, restricted the amount of crude oil they pumped 
and sold on world markets. Within a few years, this reduction in supply caused 
the world price of oil to almost double.
A large increase in the world price of oil is an example of a supply shock. A 
supply shock is an event that directly affects firms’ costs of production and thus 
the prices they charge; it shifts the economy’s aggregate-supply curve and, as a 
result, the Phillips curve. For example, when an oil price increase raises the cost 
of producing gasoline, heating oil, tires, and many other products, it reduces the 
quantity of goods and services supplied at any given price level. As panel (a) of 
Figure 8 shows, this reduction in supply is represented by the leftward shift in the 
aggregate-supply curve from AS1 to AS2. Output falls from Y1 to Y2, and the price 
level rises from P1 to P2. The combination of falling output (stagnation) and rising 
prices (inflation) is sometimes called stagflation.
This shift in aggregate supply is associated with a similar shift in the short-run 
Phillips curve, shown in panel (b). Because firms need fewer workers to produce 
the smaller output, employment falls and unemployment rises. Because the price 
level is higher, the inflation rate—the percentage change in the price level from 
supply shock
an event that directly 
alters firms’ costs and 
prices, shifting the 
economy’s aggregate-
supply curve and thus the 
Phillips curve

An Adverse Shock to 
Aggregate Supply
Figure 8
Panel (a) shows the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. When the 
aggregate-supply curve shifts to the left from AS1 to AS2, the equilibrium moves 
from point A to point B. Output falls from Y1 to Y2, and the price level rises from P1 
to P2. Panel (b) shows the short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. 
The adverse shift in aggregate supply moves the economy from a point with lower 
unemployment and lower inflation (point A) to a point with higher unemployment 
and higher inflation (point B). The short-run Phillips curve shifts to the right 
from PC1 to PC2. Policymakers now face a worse trade-off between inflation and 
unemployment.

higher unemployment and higher inflation. The short-run trade-off between infla-
tion and unemployment shifts to the right from PC1 to PC2. 
Confronted with an adverse shift in aggregate supply, policymakers face a dif-
ficult choice between fighting inflation and fighting unemployment. If they con-
tract aggregate demand to fight inflation, they will raise unemployment further. 
If they expand aggregate demand to fight unemployment, they will raise inflation 
further. In other words, policymakers face a less favorable trade-off between infla-
tion and unemployment than they did before the shift in aggregate supply: They 
have to live with a higher rate of inflation for a given rate of unemployment, a 
higher rate of unemployment for a given rate of inflation, or some combination of 
higher unemployment and higher inflation.
Faced with such an adverse shift in the Phillips curve, policymakers will ask 
whether the shift is temporary or permanent. The answer depends on how people 
adjust their expectations of inflation. If people view the rise in inflation due to the 
supply shock as a temporary aberration, expected inflation will not change, and 
the Phillips curve will soon revert to its former position. But if people believe the 
shock will lead to a new era of higher inflation, then expected inflation will rise, 
and the Phillips curve will remain at its new, less desirable position. 
In the United States during the 1970s, expected inflation did rise substantially. 
This rise in expected inflation was partly attributable to the Fed’s decision to 
accommodate the supply shock with higher money growth. (Recall that poli-
cymakers are said to accommodate an adverse supply shock when they respond

to it by increasing aggregate demand in an effort to keep output from falling.) 
Because of this policy decision, the recession that resulted from the supply shock 
was smaller than it otherwise might have been, but the U.S. economy faced an 
unfavorable trade-off between inflation and unemployment for many years. The 
problem was compounded in 1979, when OPEC once again started to exert its 
market power, more than doubling the price of oil. Figure 9 shows inflation and 
unemployment in the U.S. economy during this period.
In 1980, after two OPEC supply shocks, the U.S. economy had an inflation 
rate of more than 9 percent and an unemployment rate of about 7 percent. This 
combination of inflation and unemployment was not at all near the trade-off that 
seemed possible in the 1960s. (In the 1960s, the Phillips curve suggested that an 
unemployment rate of 7 percent would be associated with an inflation rate of only 
1 percent. Inflation of more than 9 percent was unthinkable.) With the misery 
index in 1980 near a historic high, the public was widely dissatisfied with the per-
formance of the economy. Largely because of this dissatisfaction, President Jimmy 
Carter lost his bid for reelection in November 1980 and was replaced by Ronald 
Reagan. Something had to be done, and soon it would be.

The Cost of Reducing Inflation
In October 1979, as OPEC was imposing adverse supply shocks on the world’s 
economies for the second time in a decade, Fed Chairman Paul Volcker decided 
that the time for action had come. Volcker had been appointed chairman by

President Carter only two months earlier, and he had taken the job knowing that 
inflation had reached unacceptable levels. As guardian of the nation’s monetary 
system, he felt he had little choice but to pursue a policy of disinflation. Disinflation 
is a reduction in the rate of inflation, and it should not be confused with deflation, 
a reduction in the price level. To draw an analogy to a car’s motion, disinflation is 
like slowing down, whereas deflation is like going in reverse. Chairman Volcker, 
along with many other Americans, wanted the economy’s rising level of prices to 
slow down.
Volcker had no doubt that the Fed could reduce inflation through its ability to 
control the quantity of money. But what would be the short-run cost of disinfla-
tion? The answer to this question was much less certain.
The Sacrifice Ratio
To reduce the inflation rate, the Fed has to pursue contractionary monetary policy. 
Figure 10 shows some of the effects of such a decision. When the Fed slows the 
rate at which the money supply is growing, it contracts aggregate demand. The 
fall in aggregate demand, in turn, reduces the quantity of goods and services that 
firms produce, and this fall in production leads to a rise in unemployment. The 
economy begins at point A in the figure and moves along the short-run Phillips 
curve to point B, which has lower inflation and higher unemployment. Over time, 
as people come to understand that prices are rising more slowly, expected infla-
tion falls, and the short-run Phillips curve shifts downward. The economy moves 
from point B to point C. Inflation is lower than it was initially at point A, and 
unemployment is back at its natural rate. 
Thus, if a nation wants to reduce inflation, it must endure a period of high 
unemployment and low output. In Figure 10, this cost is represented by the 
movement of the economy through point B as it travels from point A to point C. 
The size of this cost depends on the slope of the Phillips curve and how quickly 
expectations of inflation adjust to the new monetary policy.

Many studies have examined the data on inflation and unemployment to esti-
mate the cost of reducing inflation. The findings of these studies are often sum-
marized in a statistic called the sacrifice ratio. The sacrifice ratio is the number 
of percentage points of annual output lost in the process of reducing inflation by 
1 percentage point. A typical estimate of the sacrifice ratio is 5. That is, for each 
percentage point that inflation is reduced, 5 percent of annual output must be 
sacrificed in the transition.
Such estimates surely must have made Paul Volcker apprehensive as he con-
fronted the task of reducing inflation. Inflation was running at almost 10 percent 
per year. To reach moderate inflation of, say, 4 percent per year would mean 
reducing inflation by 6 percentage points. If each percentage point cost 5 percent 
of the economy’s annual output, then reducing inflation by 6 percentage points 
would require sacrificing 30 percent of annual output.
According to studies of the Phillips curve and the cost of disinflation, this 
sacrifice could be paid in various ways. An immediate reduction in inflation 
would depress output by 30 percent for a single year, but that outcome was 
surely too harsh even for an inflation hawk like Paul Volcker. It would be bet-
ter, many argued, to spread out the cost over several years. If the reduction in 
inflation took place over five years, for instance, then output would have to 
average only 6 percent below trend during that period to add up to a sacrifice 
of 30 percent. An even more gradual approach would be to reduce inflation 
slowly over a decade so that output would have to be only 3 percent below 
trend. Whatever path was chosen, however, it seemed that reducing inflation 
would not be easy.
Rational Expectations and the Possibility of  
Costless Disinflation
Just as Paul Volcker was pondering how costly reducing inflation might be, a 
group of economics professors was leading an intellectual revolution that would 
challenge the conventional wisdom on the sacrifice ratio. This group included 
such prominent economists as Robert Lucas, Thomas Sargent, and Robert Barro. 
Their revolution was based on a new approach to economic theory and policy 
called rational expectations. According to the theory of rational expectations, 
people optimally use all the information they have, including information about 
government policies, when forecasting the future. 
This new approach has had profound implications for many areas of macroeco-
nomics, but none is more important than its application to the trade-off between 
inflation and unemployment. As Friedman and Phelps had first emphasized, 
expected inflation is an important variable that explains why there is a trade-off 
between inflation and unemployment in the short run but not in the long run. 
How quickly the short-run trade-off disappears depends on how quickly people 
adjust their expectations of inflation. Proponents of rational expectations built 
on the Friedman-Phelps analysis to argue that when economic policies change, 
people adjust their expectations of inflation accordingly. The studies of inflation 
and unemployment that had tried to estimate the sacrifice ratio had failed to take 
account of the direct effect of the policy regime on expectations. As a result, esti-
mates of the sacrifice ratio were, according to the rational-expectations theorists, 
unreliable guides for policy.

In a 1981 paper titled “The End of Four Big Inflations,” Thomas Sargent 
described this new view as follows:
An alternative “rational expectations” view denies that there is any inherent 
momentum to the present process of inflation. This view maintains that firms 
and workers have now come to expect high rates of inflation in the future and 
that they strike inflationary bargains in light of these expectations. However, it 
is held that people expect high rates of inflation in the future precisely because 
the government’s current and prospective monetary and fiscal policies war-
rant those expectations. . . . An implication of this view is that inflation can be 
stopped much more quickly than advocates of the “momentum” view have 
indicated and that their estimates of the length of time and the costs of stopping 
inflation in terms of forgone output are erroneous. . . . This is not to say that 
it would be easy to eradicate inflation. On the contrary, it would require more 
than a few temporary restrictive fiscal and monetary actions. It would require a 
change in the policy regime. . . . How costly such a move would be in terms of 
forgone output and how long it would be in taking effect would depend partly 
on how resolute and evident the government’s commitment was.
According to Sargent, the sacrifice ratio could be much smaller than suggested by 
previous estimates. Indeed, in the most extreme case, it could be zero: If the gov-
ernment made a credible commitment to a policy of low inflation, people would be 
rational enough to lower their expectations of inflation immediately. The short-run 
Phillips curve would shift downward, and the economy would reach low inflation 
quickly without the cost of temporarily high unemployment and low output.
The Volcker Disinflation
As we have seen, when Paul Volcker faced the prospect of reducing inflation from 
its peak of about 10 percent, the economics profession offered two conflicting pre-
dictions. One group of economists offered estimates of the sacrifice ratio and con-
cluded that reducing inflation would have great cost in terms of lost output and 
high unemployment. Another group offered the theory of rational expectations 
and concluded that reducing inflation could be much less costly and, perhaps, 
could even have no cost at all. Who was right?
Figure 11 shows inflation and unemployment from 1979 to 1987. As you can 
see, Volcker did succeed at reducing inflation. Inflation came down from almost 
10 percent in 1981 and 1982 to about 4 percent in 1983 and 1984. Credit for this 
reduction in inflation goes completely to monetary policy. Fiscal policy at this 
time was acting in the opposite direction: The increases in the budget deficit dur-
ing the Reagan administration were expanding aggregate demand, which tends 
to raise inflation. The fall in inflation from 1981 to 1984 is attributable to the tough 
anti-inflation policies of Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.
The figure shows that the Volcker disinflation did come at the cost of high 
unemployment. In 1982 and 1983, the unemployment rate was about 10 percent—
about 4 percentage points above its level when Paul Volcker was appointed Fed 
chairman. At the same time, the production of goods and ser­vices as measured 
by real GDP was well below its trend level. The Volcker disinflation produced a 
recession that was, at the time, the deepest United States had experienced since 
the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
Does this episode refute the possibility of costless disinflation as suggested 
by the rational-expectations theorists? Some economists have argued that the

answer to this question is a resounding yes. Indeed, the pattern of disinflation 
shown in Figure 11 is similar to the pattern predicted in Figure 10. To make the 
transition from high inflation (point A in both figures) to low inflation (point C), 
the economy had to experience a painful period of high unemployment (point B).
Yet there are two reasons not to reject the conclusions of the rational-­
expectations theorists so quickly. First, even though the Volcker disinflation did 
impose a cost of temporarily high unemployment, the cost was not as large as 
many economists had predicted. Most estimates of the sacrifice ratio based on the 
Volcker disinflation are smaller than estimates that had been obtained from previ-
ous data. Perhaps Volcker’s tough stand on inflation did have some direct effect 
on expectations, as the rational-expectations theorists claimed.
Second, and more important, even though Volcker announced that he would 
aim monetary policy to lower inflation, much of the public did not believe him. 
Because few people thought Volcker would reduce inflation as quickly as he did, 
expected inflation did not fall, and the short-run Phillips curve did not shift down 
as quickly as it might have. Some evidence for this hypothesis comes from the 
forecasts made by commercial forecasting firms: Their forecasts of inflation fell 
more slowly in the 1980s than did actual inflation. Thus, the Volcker disinflation 
does not necessarily refute the rational-expectations view that credible disinfla-
tion can be costless. It does show, however, that policymakers cannot count on 
people immediately believing them when they announce a policy of disinflation.
The Greenspan Era
Since the OPEC inflation of the 1970s and the Volcker disinflation of the 1980s, the 
U.S. economy has experienced relatively mild fluctuations in inflation and unem-
ployment. Figure 12 shows inflation and unemployment from 1984 to 2005. This 
period is called the Greenspan era, after Alan Greenspan who in 1987 followed 
Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve.

This period began with a favorable supply shock. In 1986, OPEC members 
started arguing over production levels, and their long-standing agreement to 
restrict supply broke down. Oil prices fell by about half. As the figure shows, this 
favorable supply shock led to falling inflation and falling unemployment from 
1984 to 1986.
Since then, the Fed has been careful to avoid repeating the policy mistakes of 
the 1960s, when excessive aggregate demand pushed unemployment below the 
natural rate and raised inflation. When unemployment fell and inflation rose in 
1989 and 1990, the Fed raised interest rates and contracted aggregate demand, 
leading to a small recession in 1991 and 1992. Unemployment then rose above 
most estimates of the natural rate, and inflation fell once again.
The rest of the 1990s witnessed a period of economic prosperity. Inflation 
gradually drifted downward, approaching zero by the end of the decade. 
Unemployment also drifted downward, leading many observers to believe that 
the natural rate of unemployment had fallen. Part of the credit for this good 
economic performance goes to Alan Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal 
Reserve, for low inflation can be achieved only with prudent monetary policy. But 
as the following case study discusses, good luck in the form of favorable supply 
shocks is also part of the story.
The economy, however, ran into problems in 2001. The end of the dot-com 
stock-market bubble, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and corporate accounting scandals 
all depressed aggregate demand. Unemployment rose as the economy experi-
enced its first recession in a decade. But a combination of expansionary monetary 
and fiscal policies helped end the downturn, and by early 2005, unemployment 
was close to most estimates of the natural rate.
In 2005 President Bush nominated Ben Bernanke to follow Alan Greenspan 
as the chairman of the Fed. Bernanke was sworn in on February 1, 2006. In 2009

Bernanke was reappointed by President Obama. At the time of his initial nomi-
nation, Bernanke said, “My first priority will be to maintain continuity with the 
policies and policy strategies established during the Greenspan years.” 
The Phillips Curve during the Financial Crisis
Ben Bernanke may have hoped to continue the policies of the Greenspan era and 
to enjoy the relative calm of those years, but his wishes would not be fulfilled.
During his first few years on the job, the new Fed chairman faced some significant 
and daunting economic challenges.
As we have seen in previous chapters, the main challenge arose from problems 
in the housing market and financial system. From 1995 to 2006, the U.S. housing 
market boomed, and average U.S. house prices more than doubled. But this housing 
boom proved unsustainable, and from 2006 to 2009 house prices fell by about one 
third. This large fall led to declines in household wealth and difficulties in many 
financial institutions that had bet (through the purchase of mortgage-backed securi-
ties) that house prices would continue to rise. The resulting financial crisis resulted 
in a large decline in aggregate demand and a steep increase in unemployment.
We have already looked at the story of the crisis and the policy responses 
to it in many previous chapters, but Figure 13 shows the implications of these 
events for inflation and unemployment. As the decline in aggregate demand 
raised unemployment, it also reduced inflation. In essence, the economy rode the 
Phillips curve downward. 
Policymakers used expansionary monetary and fiscal policy to try to reverse 
this move. The goal was to try to increase aggregate demand, thereby moving 
the economy back along the Phillips curve toward lower unemployment and 
somewhat higher inflation. One of the questions that policymakers faced was how 
much additional inflation they should aim for, a debate discussed in the accom-
panying In the News box. As this book was being written, it was unclear how

and pushing inflation down to a very low 
level.

 Do We Need More Inflation?
In 2010, as the economy was struggling to recover from a deep recession, 
some people started wondering whether a bit more inflation would do the 
economy some good. 
in the news
The Lure of Inflation’s 
Siren Song 
By David Reilly 
I
nflation is a tempting seductress, espe-
cially in an economy overburdened by debt 
and unemployment.
	
Why not, the thinking goes, keep the 
stimulus taps open longer than necessary to 
ensure a vigorous recovery by allowing infla-
tion to overshoot targets for a year or two? 
Think of it as another dose of adrenaline 
helping unemployment fall faster and help-
ing to erode budget deficits.
	
The problem: Once unleashed, inflation 
can’t be easily contained, and sometimes 
the measures needed to do so can choke off 
growth.
	
So far, the Federal Reserve believes 
substantial slack in the economy makes 
inflation a distant prospect. Even if prices 
do rise, it has strong faith it can control 
them.
	
But there is a growing drumbeat of sup-
port for higher inflation. Olivier Blanchard, 
IMF chief economist, recently suggested cen-
tral banks consider raising inflation targets 
so they have more room to cut interest rates 
when crises hit. Some others argue employ-
ers and politicians are unwilling to address 
structural problems in the economy, leaving 
inflation as a more practical alternative.
	
Inflation can achieve what no con-
gress can, fast reductions in fiscal defi-
cits,” Christian Broda, head of international 
research at Barclays Capital, wrote in a 
research note on Monday.
	
Mr. Broda estimated that letting infla-
tion run at 5% for two years, compared 
with the Fed’s 1.5% to 2% target for core 
inflation, would reduce the unemployment 
rate by three percentage points.
	
Of course, that is beguiling with consum-
ers and the country as a whole struggling. 
And given tame inflation in the face of huge 
stimulus in recent years, the idea of runaway 
prices seems a distant threat, as the Fed said 
Tuesday.
	
But the risk that the central bank gets 
softer on inflation lies in its dual man-
date to achieve both price stability and 
maximum employment. A desire to attack 
unemployment could lead to calls for let-
ting inflation run up quietly, even if the 
target rate remains unchanged. After all, if 
the economy really is recovering, zero inter-
est rates could quickly become distortive.
	
Remember also that Fed Chairman Ben 
Bernanke’s life study has been the Great 
Depression and how to avoid a repeat. 
Interestingly, that is at odds with the 
European Central Bank, whose view is heavily 
influenced by the hyperinflation of Germany’s 
Weimar Republic. 
	
Congress, which has attacked the Fed’s 
independence, could also be an issue. It may 
push for inflation as an alternative to spend-
ing cuts or tax increases. 
	
While attractive in the short-term, infla-
tion would quickly be reflected in the cost 
of debt, hammering the value of fixed-
income securities and pushing up the cost 
of borrowing. It could also hit the dollar 
and push commodity prices even higher. 
The experience of the 1970s shows how 
painful it can be to rein in inflation once 
unleashed.
	
So investors should be alert for any signs 
that the Fed is taking price stability for granted, 
or is willing to let inflation run above target. 
Heavy borrowers need to work through their 
problems to create a sustainable rebound.
	
Inflation would be a false fix.

quickly the economy would recover from this economic downturn and whether 
higher inflation, lower inflation, or perhaps even deflation was more likely.

Conclusion
This chapter has examined how economists’ thinking about inflation and unem-
ployment has evolved. We have discussed the ideas of many of the best econo-
mists of the 20th century: from the Phillips curve of Phillips, Samuelson, and 
Solow, to the natural-rate hypothesis of Friedman and Phelps, to the rational-
expectations theory of Lucas, Sargent, and Barro. Five members of this group have 
already won Nobel Prizes for their work in economics, and more may well be so 
honored in the years to come.
Although the trade-off between inflation and unemployment has generated 
much intellectual turmoil over the past half century, certain principles have devel-
oped that today command consensus. Here is how Milton Friedman expressed the 
relationship between inflation and unemployment in 1968:
There is always a temporary tradeoff between inflation and unemployment; 
there is no permanent tradeoff. The temporary tradeoff comes not from infla-
tion per se, but from unanticipated inflation, which generally means, from a 
rising rate of inflation. The widespread belief that there is a permanent tradeoff 
is a sophisticated version of the confusion between “high” and “rising” that we 
all recognize in simpler forms. A rising rate of inflation may reduce unemploy-
ment, a high rate will not.
But how long, you will say, is “temporary”? . . . I can at most venture a per-
sonal judgment, based on some examination of the historical evidence, that the 
initial effects of a higher and unanticipated rate of inflation last for something 
like two to five years.
Today, almost a half century later, this statement still summarizes the view of 
most macroeconomists.
• The Phillips curve describes a negative rela-
tionship between inflation and unemployment. 
By expanding aggregate demand, policymakers 
can choose a point on the Phillips curve with 
higher inflation and lower unemployment. By 
contracting aggregate demand, policymakers 
can choose a point on the Phillips curve with 
lower inflation and higher unemployment.
• The trade-off between inflation and unemploy-
ment described by the Phillips curve holds only 
in the short run. In the long run, expected infla-
tion adjusts to changes in actual inflation, and 
the short-run Phillips curve shifts. As a result, 
the long-run Phillips curve is vertical at the 
natural rate of unemployment.
• The short-run Phillips curve also shifts because 
of shocks to aggregate supply. An adverse 
supply shock, such as an increase in world 
oil prices, gives policymakers a less favorable 
trade-off between inflation and unemployment. 
That is, after an adverse supply shock, policy-
makers have to accept a higher rate of inflation 
for any given rate of unemployment or a higher 
rate of unemployment for any given rate of 
inflation.
• When the Fed contracts growth in the money 
supply to reduce inflation, it moves the econ-
omy along the short-run Phillips curve, which 
results in temporarily high unemployment. The 
cost of disinflation depends on how quickly 
expectations of inflation fall. Some economists 
argue that a credible commitment to low infla-
tion can reduce the cost of disinflation by induc-
ing a quick adjustment of expectations.

	 1.	 Draw the short-run trade-off between inflation 
and unemployment. How might the Fed move 
the economy from one point on this curve to 
another?
	 2.	 Draw the long-run trade-off between inflation 
and unemployment. Explain how the short-run 
and long-run trade-offs are related.
	 3.	 What is “natural” about the natural rate of 
unemployment? Why might the natural rate of 
unemployment differ across countries?
	 4.	 Suppose a drought destroys farm crops and 
drives up the price of food. What is the effect 
on the short-run trade-off between inflation and 
unemployment?
	 5.	 The Fed decides to reduce inflation. Use the 
Phillips curve to show the short-run and 
long-run effects of this policy. How might the 
short-run costs be reduced?
Questions for Review
	 1.	 Suppose the natural rate of unemployment is 
6 percent. On one graph, draw two Phillips 
curves that describe the four situations listed 
here. Label the point that shows the position of 
the economy in each case.
a.	 Actual inflation is 5 percent, and expected 
inflation is 3 percent.
b.	Actual inflation is 3 percent, and expected 
inflation is 5 percent.
c.	 Actual inflation is 5 percent, and expected 
inflation is 5 percent.
d.	Actual inflation is 3 percent, and expected 
inflation is 3 percent.
	 2.	 Illustrate the effects of the following develop-
ments on both the short-run and long-run 
Phillips curves. Give the economic reasoning 
underlying your answers.
a.	 A rise in the natural rate of unemployment
b.	A decline in the price of imported oil
c.	 A rise in government spending
d.	A decline in expected inflation
	 3.	 Suppose that a fall in consumer spending causes 
a recession.
a.	 Illustrate the immediate change in the 
economy using both an aggregate-supply/
aggregate-demand diagram and a  
Phillips-curve diagram. On both graphs, 
label the initial long-run equilibrium as point 
A and the resulting short-run equilibrium 
as point B. What happens to inflation and 
unemployment in the short run?
b.	Now suppose that over time expected  
inflation changes in the same direction that 
actual inflation changes. What happens to the 
position of the short-run Phillips curve? After 
the recession is over, does the economy face a 
better or worse set of inflation–unemployment 
combinations? 
	 4.	 Suppose the economy is in a long-run equilibrium.
a.	 Draw the economy’s short-run and long-run 
Phillips curves.
b.	 Suppose a wave of business pessimism reduces 
aggregate demand. Show the effect of this 
shock on your diagram from part (a). If the Fed 
undertakes expansionary monetary policy, can 
it return the economy to its original inflation 
rate and original unemployment rate?
c.	 Now suppose the economy is back in  
long-run equilibrium, and then the price of 
imported oil rises. Show the effect of this 
shock with a new diagram like that in part 
(a). If the Fed undertakes expansionary 
monetary policy, can it return the economy 
to its original inflation rate and original 
unemployment rate? If the Fed undertakes 
contractionary monetary policy, can it return

the economy to its original inflation rate and 
original unemployment rate? Explain why 
this situation differs from that in part (b).
	 5.	 The inflation rate is 10 percent, and the  
central bank is considering slowing the rate of 
money growth to reduce inflation to 5 percent. 
Economist Milton believes that expectations 
of inflation change quickly in response to new 
policies, whereas economist James believes  
that expectations are very sluggish. Which 
economist is more likely to favor the proposed 
change in monetary policy? Why? 
	 6.	 Suppose the Federal Reserve’s policy is to main-
tain low and stable inflation by keeping unem-
ployment at its natural rate. However, the Fed 
believes that the natural rate of unemployment 
is 4 percent when the actual natural rate is 5 
percent. If the Fed based its policy decisions on 
its belief, what would happen to the economy? 
How might the Fed come to realize that its belief 
about the natural rate was mistaken?
	 7.	 Suppose the Federal Reserve announced that it 
would pursue contractionary monetary policy 
to reduce the inflation rate. Would the  
following conditions make the ensuing  
recession more or less severe? Explain.
a.	 Wage contracts have short durations.
b.	There is little confidence in the Fed’s  
determination to reduce inflation.
c.	 Expectations of inflation adjust quickly to 
actual inflation.
	 8.	 Given the unpopularity of inflation, why don’t 
elected leaders always support efforts to reduce 
inflation? Many economists believe that coun-
tries can reduce the cost of disinflation by let-
ting their central banks make decisions about 
monetary policy without interference from 
politicians. Why might this be so?
	 9.	 As described in the chapter, the Federal 
Reserve in 2008 faced a decrease in aggregate 
demand caused by the housing and financial 
crises and a decrease in short-run aggregate 
supply caused by rising commodity prices. 
a.	 Starting from a long-run equilibrium, illus-
trate the effects of these two changes using 
both an aggregate-supply/aggregate-demand 
diagram and a Phillips-curve diagram. On 
both diagrams, label the initial long-run equi-
librium as point A and the resulting short-run 
equilibrium as point B. For each of the follow-
ing variables, state whether it rises or falls, 
or whether the impact is ambiguous: output, 
unemployment, the price level, the inflation 
rate.
b.	 Suppose the Fed responds quickly to these 
shocks and adjusts monetary policy to keep 
unemployment and output at their natural 
rates. What action would it take? On the 
same set of graphs from part (a), show the 
results. Label the new equilibrium as point C.
c.	 Why might the Fed choose not to pursue the 
course of action described in part (b)?
	10.	 Suppose Federal Reserve policymakers accept 
the theory of the short-run Phillips curve and the 
natural-rate hypothesis and want to keep unem-
ployment close to its natural rate. Unfortunately, 
because the natural rate of unemployment can 
change over time, they aren’t certain about the 
value of the natural rate. What macroeconomic 
variables do you think they should look at when 
conducting monetary policy?
