The Influence of ­Monetary 
    and Fiscal Policy on 
    ­Aggregate Demand
I
magine that you are a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the 
group at the Federal Reserve that sets monetary policy. You observe that 
the president and Congress have agreed to raise taxes. How should the Fed 
respond to this change in fiscal policy? Should it expand the money supply, 
contract the money supply, or leave the money supply the same?
To answer this question, you need to consider the impact of monetary and 
fiscal policy on the economy. In the preceding chapter, we used the model of 
aggregate demand and aggregate supply to explain short-run economic fluctua-
tions. We saw that shifts in the aggregate-demand curve or the aggregate-supply 
curve cause fluctuations in the economy’s overall output of goods and services 
and its overall level of prices. As we noted in the previous chapter, monetary and 
fiscal policy can each influence aggregate demand. Thus, a change in one of these

policies can lead to short-run fluctuations in output and prices. Policymakers will 
want to anticipate this effect and, perhaps, adjust the other policy in response.
In this chapter, we examine in more detail how the government’s policy tools 
influence the position of the aggregate-demand curve. These tools include mon-
etary policy (the supply of money set by the central bank) and fiscal policy (the lev-
els of government spending and taxation set by the president and Congress). We 
have previously discussed the long-run effects of these policies. In Chapters      and 
    , we saw how fiscal policy affects saving, investment, and long-run economic 
growth. In Chapters      and     , we saw how monetary policy influences the price 
level in the long run. We now see how these policy tools can shift the aggregate-
demand curve and, in doing so, affect macroeconomic variables in the short run.
As we have already learned, many factors influence aggregate demand besides 
monetary and fiscal policy. In particular, desired spending by households and 
firms determines the overall demand for goods and services. When desired spend-
ing changes, aggregate demand shifts. If policymakers do not respond, such shifts 
in aggregate demand cause short-run fluctuations in output and employment. As 
a result, monetary and fiscal policymakers sometimes use the policy levers at their 
disposal to try to offset these shifts in aggregate demand and thereby stabilize the 
economy. Here we discuss the theory behind these policy actions and some of the 
difficulties that arise in using this theory in practice.
How Monetary Policy Influences Aggregate Demand
The aggregate-demand curve shows the total quantity of goods and services 
demanded in the economy for any price level. The preceding chapter discussed 
three reasons the aggregate-demand curve slopes downward: 
• 	 The wealth effect: A lower price level raises the real value of households’ 
money holdings, which are part of their wealth. Higher real wealth stimu-
lates consumer spending and thus increases the quantity of goods and ser­
vices demanded.
• 	 The interest-rate effect: A lower price level reduces the amount of money peo-
ple want to hold. As people try to lend out their excess money holdings, the 
interest rate falls. The lower interest rate stimulates investment spending 
and thus increases the quantity of goods and services demanded. 
• 	 The exchange-rate effect: When a lower price level reduces the interest rate, 
investors move some of their funds overseas in search of higher returns. 
This movement of funds causes the real value of the domestic currency to 
fall in the market for foreign-currency exchange. Domestic goods become 
less expensive relative to foreign goods. This change in the real exchange 
rate stimulates spending on net exports and thus increases the quantity of 
goods and services demanded.
These three effects occur simultaneously to increase the quantity of goods and 
services demanded when the price level falls and to decrease it when the price 
level rises.
Although all three effects work together to explain the downward slope of the 
aggregate-demand curve, they are not of equal importance. Because money hold-
ings are a small part of household wealth, the wealth effect is the least important

of the three. In addition, because exports and imports represent only a small frac-
tion of U.S. GDP, the exchange-rate effect is not large for the U.S. economy. (This 
effect is more important for smaller countries, which typically export and import 
a higher fraction of their GDP.) For the U.S. economy, the most important reason for 
the downward slope of the aggregate-demand curve is the interest-rate effect. 
To better understand aggregate demand, we now examine the short-run deter-
mination of interest rates in more detail. Here we develop the theory of liquidity 
preference. This theory of interest-rate determination will help explain the down-
ward slope of the aggregate-demand curve, as well as how monetary and fiscal pol-
icy can shift this curve. By shedding new light on aggregate demand, the theory of 
liquidity preference expands our understanding of what causes short-run economic 
fluctuations and what policymakers can potentially do about them.
The Theory of Liquidity Preference
In his classic book The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, John 
Maynard Keynes proposed the theory of liquidity preference to explain the factors 
that determine an economy’s interest rate. The theory is, in essence, an application 
of supply and demand. According to Keynes, the interest rate adjusts to balance 
the supply of and demand for money.
You may recall that economists distinguish between two interest rates: The 
nominal interest rate is the interest rate as usually reported, and the real interest rate 
is the interest rate corrected for the effects of inflation. When there is no inflation, 
the two rates are the same. But when borrowers and lenders expect prices to rise 
over the course of the loan, they agree to a nominal interest rate that exceeds the 
real interest rate by the expected rate of inflation. The higher nominal interest rate 
compensates for the fact that they expect the loan to be repaid in less valuable 
dollars.
Which interest rate are we now trying to explain with the theory of liquidity 
preference? The answer is both. In the analysis that follows, we hold constant the 
expected rate of inflation. This assumption is reasonable for studying the economy 
in the short run, because expected inflation is typically stable over short periods 
of time. In this case, nominal and real interest rates differ by a constant. When the 
nominal interest rate rises or falls, the real interest rate that people expect to earn 
rises or falls as well. For the rest of this chapter, when we refer to changes in the 
interest rate, you should envision the real and nominal interest rates moving in 
the same direction.
Let’s now develop the theory of liquidity preference by considering the supply 
and demand for money and how each depends on the interest rate. 
Money Supply  The first piece of the theory of liquidity preference is the sup-
ply of money. As we first discussed in Chapter     , the money supply in the U.S. 
economy is controlled by the Federal Reserve. The Fed alters the money supply 
primarily by changing the quantity of reserves in the banking system through the 
purchase and sale of government bonds in open-market operations. When the Fed 
buys government bonds, the dollars it pays for the bonds are typically deposited 
in banks, and these dollars are added to bank reserves. When the Fed sells govern-
ment bonds, the dollars it receives for the bonds are withdrawn from the banking 
system, and bank reserves fall. These changes in bank reserves, in turn, lead to 
changes in banks’ ability to make loans and create money. Thus, by buying and 
selling bonds in open-market operations, the Fed alters the quantity of money in 
the economy.

In addition to open-market operations, the Fed can influence the money sup-
ply using a variety of other tools. One option is for the Fed to change how much 
it lends to banks. For example, a decrease in the discount rate (the interest rate at 
which banks can borrow reserves from the Fed) encourages more bank borrow-
ing, which increases bank reserves and thereby the money supply. Conversely, an 
increase in the discount rate discourages bank borrowing, which decreases bank 
reserves and the money supply. The Fed also alters the money supply by changing 
reserve requirements (the amount of reserves banks must hold against deposits) 
and by changing the interest rate it pays banks on the reserves they are holding.
These details of monetary control are important for the implementation of Fed 
policy, but they are not crucial for the analysis in this chapter. Our goal here is 
to examine how changes in the money supply affect the aggregate demand for 
goods and services. For this purpose, we can ignore the details of how Fed policy 
is implemented and assume that the Fed controls the money supply directly. In 
other words, the quantity of money supplied in the economy is fixed at whatever 
level the Fed decides to set it. 
Because the quantity of money supplied is fixed by Fed policy, it does not 
depend on other economic variables. In particular, it does not depend on the 
interest rate. Once the Fed has made its policy decision, the quantity of money 
supplied is the same, regardless of the prevailing interest rate. We represent a 
fixed money supply with a vertical supply curve, as in Figure 1.
According to the theory of liquidity preference, the interest rate adjusts to bring the 
quantity of money supplied and the quantity of money demanded into balance. If 
the interest rate is above the equilibrium level (such as at r1), the quantity of money 
people want to hold (Md
1) is less than the quantity the Fed has created, and this surplus 
of money puts downward pressure on the interest rate. Conversely, if the interest rate 
is below the equilibrium level (such as at r2), the quantity of money people want to 
hold (Md
2) is greater than the quantity the Fed has created, and this shortage of money 
puts upward pressure on the interest rate. Thus, the forces of supply and demand in 
the market for money push the interest rate toward the equilibrium interest rate, at 
which people are content holding the quantity of money the Fed has created.

Money Demand  The second piece of the theory of liquidity preference is the 
demand for money. As a starting point for understanding money demand, recall 
that any asset’s liquidity refers to the ease with which that asset can be converted 
into the economy’s medium of exchange. Because money is the economy’s medi-
um of exchange, it is by definition the most liquid asset available. The liquidity of 
money explains the demand for it: People choose to hold money instead of other 
assets that offer higher rates of return because money can be used to buy goods 
and services.
Although many factors determine the quantity of money demanded, the one 
emphasized by the theory of liquidity preference is the interest rate. The reason is 
that the interest rate is the opportunity cost of holding money. That is, when you 
hold wealth as cash in your wallet, instead of as an interest-bearing bond, you 
lose the interest you could have earned. An increase in the interest rate raises the 
cost of holding money and, as a result, reduces the quantity of money demanded. 
A decrease in the interest rate reduces the cost of holding money and raises the 
quantity demanded. Thus, as shown in Figure 1, the money-demand curve slopes 
downward.
Equilibrium in the Money Market  According to the theory of liquidity 
preference, the interest rate adjusts to balance the supply and demand for money. 
There is one interest rate, called the equilibrium interest rate, at which the quantity 
of money demanded exactly balances the quantity of money supplied. If the inter-
est rate is at any other level, people will try to adjust their portfolios of assets and, 
as a result, drive the interest rate toward the equilibrium.
For example, suppose that the interest rate is above the equilibrium level, 
such as r1 in Figure 1. In this case, the quantity of money that people want to 
hold, Md
1, is less than the quantity of money that the Fed has supplied. Those 
people who are holding the surplus of money will try to get rid of it by buying 
interest‑bearing bonds or by depositing it in an interest-bearing bank account. 
Because bond issuers and banks prefer to pay lower interest rates, they respond 
to this surplus of money by lowering the interest rates they offer. As the interest 
rate falls, people become more willing to hold money until, at the equilibrium 
interest rate, people are happy to hold exactly the amount of money the Fed has 
supplied.
Conversely, at interest rates below the equilibrium level, such as r2 in Figure 1, 
the quantity of money that people want to hold, Md
2, is greater than the quantity of 
money that the Fed has supplied. As a result, people try to increase their holdings 
of money by reducing their holdings of bonds and other interest-bearing assets. 
As people cut back on their holdings of bonds, bond issuers find that they have 
to offer higher interest rates to attract buyers. Thus, the interest rate rises and 
approaches the equilibrium level.
The Downward Slope of the  
Aggregate-Demand Curve
Having seen how the theory of liquidity preference explains the economy’s equi-
librium interest rate, we now consider the theory’s implications for the aggregate 
demand for goods and services. As a warm-up exercise, let’s begin by using the 
theory to reexamine a topic we already understand—the interest-rate effect and 
the downward slope of the aggregate-demand curve. In particular, suppose that 
the overall level of prices in the economy rises. What happens to the interest rate

 Interest Rates in the Long Run and the 
Short Run
In an earlier chapter, we said that the interest rate adjusts to bal-
ance the supply of loanable funds (national saving) and the demand 
for loanable funds (desired investment). Here we just said that the 
interest rate adjusts to balance the supply of and demand for money. 
Can we reconcile these two theories? 
	
To answer this question, we need to focus on three macroeco-
nomic variables: the economy’s output of goods and services, the 
interest rate, and the price level. According to the classical macro-
economic theory we developed earlier in the book, these variables 
are determined as follows:
1.	 Output is determined by the supplies of capital and labor and 
the available production technology for turning capital and 
labor into output. (We call this the natural rate of output.)
2.	 For any given level of output, the interest rate adjusts to 
balance the supply and demand for loanable funds. 
3.	 Given output and the interest rate, the price level adjusts to 
balance the supply and demand for money. Changes in the 
supply of money lead to proportionate changes in the price 
level.
These are three of the essential propositions of classical economic 
theory. Most economists believe that these propositions do a good 
job of describing how the economy works in the long run.
	
Yet these propositions do not hold in the short run. As we 
discussed in the preceding chapter, many prices are slow to adjust 
to changes in the money supply; this fact is reflected in a short-run 
aggregate-supply curve that is upward sloping rather than vertical. As 
a result, in the short run, the overall price level cannot, by itself, move 
to balance the supply of and demand for money. This stickiness of the 
price level requires the interest rate to move to bring the money mar-
ket into equilibrium. These changes in the interest rate, in turn, affect 
the aggregate demand for goods and services. As aggregate demand 
fluctuates, the economy’s output of goods and services moves away 
from the level determined by factor supplies and technology. 
	
To think about the operation of the economy in the short run 
(day to day, week to week, month to month, or quarter to quarter), 
it is best to keep in mind the following logic:
1.	 The price level is stuck at some level (based on previously 
formed expectations) and, in the short run, is relatively unre-
sponsive to changing economic conditions.
2.	 For any given (stuck) price level, the interest rate adjusts to 
balance the supply of and demand for money.
3.	 The interest rate that balances the money market influences 
the quantity of goods and services demanded and thus the 
level of output. 
Notice that this precisely reverses the order of analysis used to study 
the economy in the long run.
	
The two different theories of the interest rate are useful for dif-
ferent purposes. When thinking about the long-run determinants of 
interest rates, it is best to keep in mind the loanable-funds theory, 
which highlights the importance of an economy’s saving propensi-
ties and investment opportunities. By contrast, when thinking about 
the short-run determinants of interest rates, it is best to keep in 
mind the liquidity-preference theory, which highlights the impor-
tance of monetary policy.
that balances the supply and demand for money, and how does that change affect 
the quantity of goods and services demanded?
As we discussed in Chapter     , the price level is one determinant of the quan-
tity of money demanded. At higher prices, more money is exchanged every time 
a good or service is sold. As a result, people will choose to hold a larger quantity 
of money. That is, a higher price level increases the quantity of money demanded 
for any given interest rate. Thus, an increase in the price level from P1 to P2 shifts 
the money-demand curve to the right from MD1 to MD2, as shown in panel (a) of 
Figure 2.

Curve
Figure 2
An increase in the price level from P1 to P2 shifts the money-demand curve to the 
right, as in panel (a). This increase in money demand causes the interest rate to rise 
from r1 to r2. Because the interest rate is the cost of borrowing, the increase in the 
interest rate reduces the quantity of goods and services demanded from Y1 to Y2. This 
negative relationship between the price level and quantity demanded is represented 
with a downward-sloping aggregate-demand curve, as in panel (b).

Notice how this shift in money demand affects the equilibrium in the money 
market. For a fixed money supply, the interest rate must rise to balance money 
supply and money demand. Because the higher price level has increased the 
amount of money people want to hold, it has shifted the money demand curve 
to the right. Yet the quantity of money supplied is unchanged, so the interest rate 
must rise from r1 to r2 to discourage the additional demand. 
This increase in the interest rate has ramifications not only for the money market 
but also for the quantity of goods and services demanded, as shown in panel (b). At 
a higher interest rate, the cost of borrowing and the return to saving are greater. 
Fewer households choose to borrow to buy a new house, and those who do buy 
smaller houses, so the demand for residential investment falls. Fewer firms choose 
to borrow to build new factories and buy new equipment, so business investment 
falls. Thus, when the price level rises from P1 to P2, increasing money demand 
from MD1 to MD2 and raising the interest rate from r1 to r2, the quantity of goods 
and services demanded falls from Y1 to Y2. 
This analysis of the interest-rate effect can be summarized in three steps: 
(1) A higher price level raises money demand. (2) Higher money demand leads 
to a higher interest rate. (3) A higher interest rate reduces the quantity of goods 
and services demanded. The same logic works in reverse: A lower price level 
reduces money demand, which leads to a lower interest rate, and this in turn 
increases the quantity of goods and services demanded. The result of this analy-
sis is a negative relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods 
and services demanded, as illustrated by a downward-sloping aggregate-
demand curve.

Changes in the Money Supply
So far, we have used the theory of liquidity preference to explain more fully how 
the total quantity of goods and services demanded in the economy changes as the 
price level changes. That is, we have examined movements along a downward-
sloping aggregate-demand curve. The theory also sheds light, however, on some 
of the other events that alter the quantity of goods and services demanded. 
Whenever the quantity of goods and services demanded changes for any given 
price level, the aggregate-demand curve shifts.
One important variable that shifts the aggregate-demand curve is monetary 
policy. To see how monetary policy affects the economy in the short run, suppose 
that the Fed increases the money supply by buying government bonds in open-
market operations. (Why the Fed might do this will become clear later, after we 
understand the effects of such a move.) Let’s consider how this monetary injection 
influences the equilibrium interest rate for a given price level. This will tell us 
what the injection does to the position of the aggregate-demand curve.
As panel (a) of Figure 3 shows, an increase in the money supply shifts the 
money-supply curve to the right from MS1 to MS2. Because the money-demand 
curve has not changed, the interest rate falls from r1 to r2 to balance money supply 
and money demand. That is, the interest rate must fall to induce people to hold the 
additional money the Fed has created, restoring equilibrium in the money market. 
Once again, the interest rate influences the quantity of goods and services 
demanded, as shown in panel (b) of Figure 3. The lower interest rate reduces 
the cost of borrowing and the return to saving. Households buy more and larger 
houses, stimulating the demand for residential investment. Firms spend more on 
In panel (a), an increase in the money supply from MS1 to MS2 reduces the equilibrium 
interest rate from r1 to r2. Because the interest rate is the cost of borrowing, the fall in 
the interest rate raises the quantity of goods and services demanded at a given price 
level from Y1 to Y2. Thus, in panel (b), the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right 
from AD1 to AD2.

new factories and new equipment, stimulating business investment. As a result, 
the quantity of goods and services demanded at a given price level, P, rises from 
Y1 to Y2. Of course, there is nothing special about P: The monetary injection raises 
the quantity of goods and services demanded at every price level. Thus, the entire 
aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right.
To sum up: When the Fed increases the money supply, it lowers the interest rate and 
increases the quantity of goods and services demanded for any given price level, shifting 
the aggregate-demand curve to the right. Conversely, when the Fed contracts the money 
supply, it raises the interest rate and reduces the quantity of goods and services demanded 
for any given price level, shifting the aggregate-demand curve to the left.
The Role of Interest-Rate Targets in Fed Policy
How does the Federal Reserve affect the economy? Our discussion here and 
earlier in the book has treated the money supply as the Fed’s policy instrument. 
When the Fed buys government bonds in open-market operations, it increases the 
money supply and expands aggregate demand. When the Fed sells government 
bonds in open-market operations, it decreases the money supply and contracts 
aggregate demand.
Discussions of Fed policy often treat the interest rate, rather than the money 
supply, as the Fed’s policy instrument. Indeed, in recent years, the Federal 
Reserve has conducted policy by setting a target for the federal funds rate—the 
interest rate that banks charge one another for short-term loans. This target is 
reevaluated every six weeks at meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC). The FOMC has chosen to set a target for the federal funds rate, rather 
than for the money supply, as it has done at times in the past.
There are several related reasons for the Fed’s decision to use the federal funds 
rate as its target. One is that the money supply is hard to measure with sufficient 
precision. Another is that money demand fluctuates over time. For any given 
money supply, fluctuations in money demand would lead to fluctuations in inter-
est rates, aggregate demand, and output. By contrast, when the Fed announces a 
target for the federal funds rate, it essentially accommodates the day-to-day shifts 
in money demand by adjusting the money supply accordingly.
The Fed’s decision to target an interest rate does not fundamentally alter our 
analysis of monetary policy. The theory of liquidity preference illustrates an 
important principle: Monetary policy can be described either in terms of the money 
supply or in terms of the interest rate. When the FOMC sets a target for the federal 
funds rate of, say, 6 percent, the Fed’s bond traders are told: “Conduct whatever 
open-market operations are necessary to ensure that the equilibrium interest rate 
equals 6 percent.” In other words, when the Fed sets a target for the interest rate, 
it commits itself to adjusting the money supply to make the equilibrium in the 
money market hit that target.
As a result, changes in monetary policy can be viewed either in terms of chang-
ing the interest rate target or in terms of changing the money supply. When you 
read in the newspaper that “the Fed has lowered the federal funds rate from 6 to 
5 percent,” you should understand that this occurs only because the Fed’s bond 
traders are doing what it takes to make it happen. To lower the federal funds 
rate, the Fed’s bond traders buy government bonds, and this purchase increases 
the money supply and lowers the equilibrium interest rate (just as in Figure 3). 
Similarly, when the FOMC raises the target for the federal funds rate, the bond 
traders sell government bonds, and this sale decreases the money supply and 
raises the equilibrium interest rate.

FYI
 The Zero Lower Bound
As we have just seen, monetary policy works through interest rates. 
This conclusion raises a question: What if the Fed’s target interest 
rate has fallen as far as it can? In the recession of 2008 and 2009, 
the federal funds rate fell to about zero. What, if anything, can 
monetary policy do then to stimulate the economy?
	
Some economists describe this situation as a liquidity trap. 
According to the theory of liquidity preference, expansionary mon-
etary policy works by reducing interest rates and stimulating invest-
ment spending. But if interest rates have already fallen almost to 
zero, then perhaps monetary policy is no longer effective. Nominal 
interest rates cannot fall below zero: Rather than making a loan at 
a negative nominal interest rate, a person would just hold cash. In 
this environment, expansionary monetary policy raises the supply of 
money, making the public’s asset portfolio more liquid, but because 
interest rates can’t fall any further, the extra liquidity might not have 
any effect. Aggregate demand, production, and employment may be 
“trapped” at low levels.
	
Other economists are skeptical about the relevance of liquid-
ity traps and believe that a central bank continues to have tools 
to expand the economy, even after its interest rate target hits 
its lower bound of zero. One possibility is that the central bank 
could raise inflation expectations by committing itself to future 
monetary expansion. Even if nominal interest rates cannot fall 
any further, higher expected inflation can lower real interest rates 
by making them negative, which would stimulate investment 
spending. 
	
A second possibility is that the central bank could conduct 
expansionary open-market operations with a larger variety of finan-
cial instruments than it normally uses. For example, it could buy 
mortgages and corporate debt and thereby lower the interest rates 
on these kinds of loans. The Federal Reserve actively pursued this 
last option during the downturn of 2008 and 2009.
	
Some economists have suggested that the possibility of hitting 
the zero lower bound for interest rates justifies setting the target 
rate of inflation well above zero. Under zero inflation, the real inter-
est rate, like the nominal interest, can never fall below zero. But if 
the normal rate of inflation is, say, 4 percent, then the central bank 
can easily push the real interest rate to negative 4 percent by lower-
ing the nominal interest rate toward zero. Thus, moderate inflation 
gives monetary policymakers more room to stimulate the economy 
when needed, reducing the risk of hitting up against the zero lower 
bound and having the economy fall into a liquidity trap.
The lessons from this analysis are simple: Changes in monetary policy aimed at 
expanding aggregate demand can be described either as increasing the money supply or 
as lowering the interest rate. Changes in monetary policy aimed at contracting aggregate 
demand can be described either as decreasing the money supply or as raising the interest rate.
Why the Fed Watches the Stock Market  
(and Vice Versa)
“The stock market has predicted nine out of the past five recessions.” So quipped 
Paul Samuelson, the famed economist (and textbook author). Samuelson was 
surely right that the stock market is highly volatile and can give wrong signals 
about the economy. But fluctuations in stock prices are often a sign of broader 
economic developments. The economic boom of the 1990s, for example, appeared 
not only in rapid GDP growth and falling unemployment but also in rising stock 
prices, which increased about fourfold during this decade. Similarly, the deep 
recession of 2008 and 2009 was reflected in falling stock prices: From November 
2007 to March 2009, the stock market lost about half its value.

How should the Fed respond to stock-market fluctuations? The Fed has no rea-
son to care about stock prices in themselves, but it does have the job of monitoring 
and responding to developments in the overall economy, and the stock market is 
a piece of that puzzle. When the stock market booms, households become wealth-
ier, and this increased wealth stimulates consumer spending. In addition, a rise 
in stock prices makes it more attractive for firms to sell new shares of stock, and 
this stimulates investment spending. For both reasons, a booming stock market 
expands the aggregate demand for goods and services.
	
As we discuss more fully later in the chapter, one of the Fed’s goals is to sta-
bilize aggregate demand, because greater stability in aggregate demand means 
greater stability in output and the price level. To promote stability, the Fed might 
respond to a stock-market boom by keeping the money supply lower and interest 
rates higher than it otherwise would. The contractionary effects of higher inter-
est rates would offset the expansionary effects of higher stock prices. In fact, this 
analysis does describe Fed behavior: Real interest rates were kept high by histori-
cal standards during the stock-market boom of the late 1990s.
	
The opposite occurs when the stock market falls. Spending on consumption 
and investment tends to decline, depressing aggregate demand and pushing 
the economy toward recession. To stabilize aggregate demand, the Fed would 
increase the money supply and lower interest rates. And indeed, that is what it 
typically does. For example, on October 19, 1987, the stock market fell by 22.6 
percent—one of the biggest one-day drops in history. The Fed responded to the 
market crash by increasing the money supply and lowering interest rates. The 
federal funds rate fell from 7.7 percent at the beginning of October to 6.6 percent 
at the end of the month. In part because of the Fed’s quick action, the economy 
avoided a recession. Similarly, as we discussed in a case study in the preceding 
chapter, the Fed also reduced interest rates during the economic downturn and 
stock market decline of 2008 and 2009, but this time monetary policy was not suf-
ficient to avert a deep recession.
	
While the Fed keeps an eye on the stock market, stock-market participants also 
keep an eye on the Fed. Because the Fed can influence interest rates and economic 
activity, it can alter the value of stocks. For example, when the Fed raises inter-
est rates by reducing the money supply, it makes owning stocks less attractive 
for two reasons. First, a higher interest rate means that bonds, the alternative 
to stocks, are earning a higher return. Second, the Fed’s tightening of monetary 
policy reduces the demand for goods and services, which reduces profits. As a 
result, stock prices often fall when the Fed raises interest rates. ■

How Fiscal Policy Influences Aggregate Demand
The government can influence the behavior of the economy not only with mone­
tary policy but also with fiscal policy. Fiscal policy refers to the government’s 
choices regarding the overall level of government purchases and taxes. Earlier 
in the book, we examined how fiscal policy influences saving, investment, and 
growth in the long run. In the short run, however, the primary effect of fiscal 
policy is on the aggregate demand for goods and services.

Changes in Government Purchases
When policymakers change the money supply or the level of taxes, they shift 
the aggregate-demand curve indirectly by influencing the spending decisions of 
firms or households. By contrast, when the government alters its own purchases 
of goods and services, it shifts the aggregate-demand curve directly.
Suppose, for instance, that the U.S. Department of Defense places a $20 billion 
order for new fighter planes with Boeing, the large aircraft manufacturer. This 
order raises the demand for the output produced by Boeing, which induces the 
company to hire more workers and increase production. Because Boeing is part of 
the economy, the increase in the demand for Boeing planes means an increase in 
the total quantity of goods and services demanded at each price level. As a result, 
the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right.
By how much does this $20 billion order from the government shift the aggre-
gate-demand curve? At first, one might guess that the aggregate-demand curve 
shifts to the right by exactly $20 billion. It turns out, however, that this is not the 
case. There are two macroeconomic effects that cause the size of the shift in aggre-
gate demand to differ from the change in government purchases. The first—the 
multiplier effect—suggests the shift in aggregate demand could be larger than 
$20 billion. The second—the crowding-out effect—suggests the shift in aggregate 
demand could be smaller than $20 billion. We now discuss each of these effects 
in turn. 
The Multiplier Effect
When the government buys $20 billion of goods from Boeing, that purchase has 
repercussions. The immediate impact of the higher demand from the govern-
ment is to raise employment and profits at Boeing. Then, as the workers see 
higher earnings and the firm owners see higher profits, they respond to this 
increase in income by raising their own spending on consumer goods. As a 
result, the government purchase from Boeing raises the demand for the prod-
ucts of many other firms in the economy. Because each dollar spent by the gov-
ernment can raise the aggregate demand for goods and services by more than a 
dollar, government purchases are said to have a multiplier effect on aggregate 
demand.
This multiplier effect continues even after this first round. When consumer 
spending rises, the firms that produce these consumer goods hire more people 
and experience higher profits. Higher earnings and profits stimulate consumer 
spending once again and so on. Thus, there is positive feedback as higher demand 
leads to higher income, which in turn leads to even higher demand. Once all these 
effects are added together, the total impact on the quantity of goods and services 
demanded can be much larger than the initial impulse from higher government 
spending. 
Figure 4 illustrates the multiplier effect. The increase in government purchases 
of $20 billion initially shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right from AD1 
to AD2 by exactly $20 billion. But when consumers respond by increasing their 
spending, the aggregate-demand curve shifts still further to AD3.
This multiplier effect arising from the response of consumer spending can 
be strengthened by the response of investment to higher levels of demand. For 
instance, Boeing might respond to the higher demand for planes by deciding 
to buy more equipment or build another plant. In this case, higher government 
demand spurs higher demand for investment goods. This positive feedback from 
demand to investment is sometimes called the investment accelerator.

The Multiplier Effect
An increase in government 
purchases of $20 billion can 
shift the aggregate-demand 
curve to the right by more 
than $20 billion. This multiplier 
effect arises because increases 
in aggregate income stimulate 
additional spending by 
consumers.

A Formula for the Spending Multiplier
Some simple algebra permits us to derive a formula for the size of the multiplier 
effect that arises when an increase in government purchases induces increases in 
consumer spending. An important number in this formula is the marginal propen-
sity to consume (MPC)—the fraction of extra income that a household consumes 
rather than saves. For example, suppose that the marginal propensity to consume 
is 3⁄4. This means that for every extra dollar that a household earns, the household 
spends $0.75 (3⁄4 of the dollar) and saves $0.25. With an MPC of 3⁄4, when the work-
ers and owners of Boeing earn $20 billion from the government contract, they 
increase their consumer spending by 3⁄4 × $20 billion, or $15 billion.
To gauge the impact on aggregate demand of a change in government pur-
chases, we follow the effects step by step. The process begins when the govern-
ment spends $20 billion, which implies that national income (earnings and profits) 
also rises by this amount. This increase in income in turn raises consumer spend-
ing by MPC × $20 billion, which in turn raises the income for the workers and 
owners of the firms that produce the consumption goods. This second increase in 
income again raises consumer spending, this time by MPC × (MPC × $20 billion). 
These feedback effects go on and on. 
To find the total impact on the demand for goods and services, we add up all 
these effects:
	
Change in government purchases	=	
$20 billion
	
First change in consumption	
=	 MPC	 ×	$20 billion

Here “. . .” represents an infinite number of similar terms. Thus, we can write the 
multiplier as follows:
	
Multiplier = 1 + MPC + MPC2 + MPC3 + . . . .
This multiplier tells us the demand for goods and services that each dollar of 
government purchases generates.
To simplify this equation for the multiplier, recall from math class that this 
expression is an infinite geometric series. For x between –1 and +1,
1 + x + x2 + x3 + . . . = 1/(1 – x).
In our case, x = MPC. Thus, 
Multiplier = 1/(1 – MPC).
For example, if MPC is 3⁄4, the multiplier is 1/(1 – 3⁄4), which is 4. In this case, the 
$20 billion of government spending generates $80 billion of demand for goods 
and services.
This formula for the multiplier shows an important conclusion: The size of the 
multiplier depends on the marginal propensity to consume. While an MPC of 
¾ leads to a multiplier of 4, an MPC of ½ leads to a multiplier of only 2. Thus, a 
larger MPC means a larger multiplier. To see why this is true, remember that the 
multiplier arises because higher income induces greater spending on consump-
tion. With a larger MPC, consumption responds more to a change in income, and 
so the multiplier is larger.
Other Applications of the Multiplier Effect
Because of the multiplier effect, a dollar of government purchases can generate 
more than a dollar of aggregate demand. The logic of the multiplier effect, how-
ever, is not restricted to changes in government purchases. Instead, it applies to 
any event that alters spending on any component of GDP—consumption, invest-
ment, government purchases, or net exports.
For example, suppose that a recession overseas reduces the demand for 
U.S. net exports by $10 billion. This reduced spending on U.S. goods and 
services depresses U.S. national income, which reduces spending by U.S. 
consumers. If the marginal propensity to consume is ¾ and the multiplier 
is 4, then the $10 billion fall in net exports means a $40 billion contraction in 
aggregate demand.
As another example, suppose that a stock-market boom increases households’ 
wealth and stimulates their spending on goods and services by $20 billion. This 
extra consumer spending increases national income, which in turn generates 
even more consumer spending. If the marginal propensity to consume is ¾ and 
the multiplier is 4, then the initial impulse of $20 billion in consumer spending 
translates into an $80 billion increase in aggregate demand.
The multiplier is an important concept in macroeconomics because it shows 
how the economy can amplify the impact of changes in spending. A small initial 
change in consumption, investment, government purchases, or net exports can 
end up having a large effect on aggregate demand and, therefore, the economy’s 
production of goods and services.

The Crowding-Out Effect
The multiplier effect seems to suggest that when the government buys $20 billion 
of planes from Boeing, the resulting expansion in aggregate demand is necessarily 
larger than $20 billion. Yet another effect works in the opposite direction. While 
an increase in government purchases stimulates the aggregate demand for goods 
and services, it also causes the interest rate to rise, which reduces investment 
spending and puts downward pressure on aggregate demand. The reduction in 
aggregate demand that results when a fiscal expansion raises the interest rate is 
called the crowding-out effect.
To see why crowding out occurs, let’s consider what happens in the money 
market when the government buys planes from Boeing. As we have discussed, 
this increase in demand raises the incomes of the workers and owners of this 
firm (and because of the multiplier effect, of other firms as well). As incomes rise, 
households plan to buy more goods and services and, as a result, choose to hold 
more of their wealth in liquid form. That is, the increase in income caused by the 
fiscal expansion raises the demand for money. 
The effect of the increase in money demand is shown in panel (a) of Figure 5. 
Because the Fed has not changed the money supply, the vertical supply curve 
remains the same. When the higher level of income shifts the money-demand 
curve to the right from MD1 to MD2, the interest rate must rise from r1 to r2 to keep 
supply and demand in balance.

demand that results

policy raises the interest

The Crowding-Out  
Effect
Figure 5
Panel (a) shows the money market. When the government increases its purchases of 
goods and services, the resulting increase in income raises the demand for money 
from MD1 to MD2, and this causes the equilibrium interest rate to rise from r1 to r2. 
Panel (b) shows the effects on aggregate demand. The initial impact of the increase 
in government purchases shifts the aggregate-demand curve from AD1 to AD2. 
Yet because the interest rate is the cost of borrowing, the increase in the interest 
rate tends to reduce the quantity of goods and services demanded, particularly for 
investment goods. This crowding out of investment partially offsets the impact of the 
fiscal expansion on aggregate demand. In the end, the aggregate-demand curve shifts 
only to AD3.

The increase in the interest rate, in turn, reduces the quantity of goods and ser­
vices demanded. In particular, because borrowing is more expensive, the demand 
for residential and business investment goods declines. That is, as the increase in 
government purchases increases the demand for goods and services, it may also 
crowd out investment. This crowding-out effect partially offsets the impact of 
government purchases on aggregate demand, as illustrated in panel (b) of Figure 5. 
The increase in government purchases initially shifts the aggregate-demand curve 
from AD1 to AD2, but once crowding out takes place, the aggregate-demand curve 
drops back to AD3.
To sum up: When the government increases its purchases by $20 billion, the aggregate 
demand for goods and services could rise by more or less than $20 billion depending on the 
sizes of the multiplier and crowding-out effects. The multiplier effect by itself makes the 
shift in aggregate demand greater than $20 billion. The crowding-out effect pushes 
the aggregate-demand curve in the opposite direction and, if large enough, could 
result in an aggregate-demand shift of less than $20 billion.
Changes in Taxes
The other important instrument of fiscal policy, besides the level of government 
purchases, is the level of taxation. When the government cuts personal income 
taxes, for instance, it increases households’ take-home pay. Households will save 
some of this additional income, but they will also spend some of it on consumer 
goods. Because it increases consumer spending, the tax cut shifts the aggregate-
demand curve to the right. Similarly, a tax increase depresses consumer spending 
and shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.
The size of the shift in aggregate demand resulting from a tax change is also 
affected by the multiplier and crowding-out effects. When the government cuts 
taxes and stimulates consumer spending, earnings and profits rise, which further 
stimulates consumer spending. This is the multiplier effect. At the same time, 
higher income leads to higher money demand, which tends to raise interest rates. 
Higher interest rates make borrowing more costly, which reduces investment 
spending. This is the crowding-out effect. Depending on the size of the multiplier 
and crowding-out effects, the shift in aggregate demand could be larger or smaller 
than the tax change that causes it.
In addition to the multiplier and crowding-out effects, there is another impor-
tant determinant of the size of the shift in aggregate demand that results from a 
tax change: households’ perceptions about whether the tax change is permanent 
or temporary. For example, suppose that the government announces a tax cut of 
$1,000 per household. In deciding how much of this $1,000 to spend, households 
must ask themselves how long this extra income will last. If households expect the 
tax cut to be permanent, they will view it as adding substantially to their financial 
resources and, therefore, increase their spending by a large amount. In this case, the 
tax cut will have a large impact on aggregate demand. By contrast, if households 
expect the tax change to be temporary, they will view it as adding only slightly to 
their financial resources and, therefore, will increase their spending by only a small 
amount. In this case, the tax cut will have a small impact on aggregate demand.
An extreme example of a temporary tax cut was the one announced in 1992. In 
that year, President George H. W. Bush faced a lingering recession and an upcom-
ing reelection campaign. He responded to these circumstances by announcing a 
reduction in the amount of income tax that the federal government was with-
holding from workers’ paychecks. Because legislated income tax rates did not 
change, however, every dollar of reduced withholding in 1992 meant an extra 
dollar of taxes due on April 15, 1993, when income tax returns for 1992 were to

FYI
 How Fiscal Policy Might Affect 
Aggregate Supply
So far, our discussion of fiscal policy has stressed how changes in 
government purchases and changes in taxes influence the quantity 
of goods and services demanded. Most economists believe that 
the short-run macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy work primarily 
through aggregate demand. Yet fiscal policy can potentially influ-
ence the quantity of goods and services supplied as well.
	
For instance, consider the effects of tax changes on aggregate 
supply. One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that 
people respond to incentives. When government policymakers cut 
tax rates, workers get to keep more of each dollar they earn, so they 
have a greater incentive to work and produce goods and services. 
If they respond to this incentive, the quantity of goods and services 
supplied will be greater at each price level, and the aggregate-
supply curve will shift to the right. 
	
Some economists, called supply-siders, have argued that the 
influence of tax cuts on aggregate supply is large. According to some 
supply-siders, the influence is so large that a cut in tax rates will 
­stimulate enough additional production and income that tax rev-
enue will actually increase. This is certainly a theoretical possibility, 
but most economists do not consider it the normal case. While the 
supply-side effects of taxes are important to consider, they are usually 
not large enough to cause tax revenue to rise when tax rates fall.
	
Like changes in taxes, changes in government purchases can 
also potentially affect aggregate supply. Suppose, for instance, that 
the government increases expenditure on a form of government- 
provided capital, such as roads. Roads are used by private businesses 
to make deliveries to their customers; an increase in the quantity 
of roads increases these businesses’ productivity. Hence, when the 
government spends more on roads, it increases the quantity of goods 
and services supplied at any given price level and, thus, shifts the 
aggregate-supply curve to the right. This effect on aggregate supply 
is probably more important in the long run than in the short run, 
however, because it would take some time for the government to 
build the new roads and put them into use.
be filed. Thus, this “tax cut” actually represented only a short-term loan from the 
government. Not surprisingly, the impact of the policy on consumer spending 
and aggregate demand was relatively small.

Using Policy to Stabilize the Economy
We have seen how monetary and fiscal policy can affect the economy’s aggregate 
demand for goods and services. These theoretical insights raise some important 
policy questions: Should policymakers use these instruments to control aggregate 
demand and stabilize the economy? If so, when? If not, why not?
The Case for Active Stabilization Policy
Let’s return to the question that began this chapter: When the president and 
Congress raise taxes, how should the Federal Reserve respond? As we have seen, 
the level of taxation is one determinant of the position of the aggregate-demand

curve. When the government raises taxes, aggregate demand will fall, depress-
ing production and employment in the short run. If the Federal Reserve wants to 
prevent this adverse effect of the fiscal policy, it can expand aggregate demand by 
increasing the money supply. A monetary expansion would reduce interest rates, 
stimulate investment spending, and expand aggregate demand. If monetary pol-
icy responds appropriately, the combined changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
could leave the aggregate demand for goods and services unaffected.
This analysis is exactly the sort followed by members of the Federal Open 
Market Committee. They know that monetary policy is an important determinant 
of aggregate demand. They also know that there are other important determi-
nants as well, including fiscal policy set by the president and Congress. As a 
result, the Fed’s Open Market Committee watches the debates over fiscal policy 
with a keen eye.
This response of monetary policy to the change in fiscal policy is an example of 
a more general phenomenon: the use of policy instruments to stabilize aggregate 
demand and, as a result, production and employment. Economic stabilization has 
been an explicit goal of U.S. policy since the Employment Act of 1946. This act 
states that “it is the continuing policy and responsibility of the federal government 
to . . . promote full employment and production.” In essence, the government has 
chosen to hold itself accountable for short-run macroeconomic performance.
The Employment Act has two implications. The first, more modest, implication 
is that the government should avoid being a cause of economic fluctuations. Thus, 
most economists advise against large and sudden changes in monetary and fis-
cal policy, for such changes are likely to cause fluctuations in aggregate demand. 
Moreover, when large changes do occur, it is important that monetary and fiscal 
policymakers be aware of and respond to each others’ actions.
The second, more ambitious, implication of the Employment Act is that the 
government should respond to changes in the private economy to stabilize 
aggregate demand. The act was passed not long after the publication of Keynes’s 
The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, which has been one of the 
most ­influential books ever written about economics. In it, Keynes emphasized 
the key role of aggregate demand in explaining short-run economic fluctuations. 
Keynes claimed that the government should actively stimulate aggregate demand 
when aggregate demand appeared insufficient to maintain production at its full-
employment level. 
Keynes (and his many followers) argued that aggregate demand fluctuates 
because of largely irrational waves of pessimism and optimism. He used the term 
“animal spirits” to refer to these arbitrary changes in attitude. When pessimism 
reigns, households reduce consumption spending, and firms reduce investment 
spending. The result is reduced aggregate demand, lower production, and higher 
unemployment. Conversely, when optimism reigns, households and firms increase 
spending. The result is higher aggregate demand, higher production, and inflation-
ary pressure. Notice that these changes in attitude are, to some extent, self-fulfilling.
In principle, the government can adjust its monetary and fiscal policy in 
response to these waves of optimism and pessimism and, thereby, stabilize the 
economy. For example, when people are excessively pessimistic, the Fed can 
expand the money supply to lower interest rates and expand aggregate demand. 
When they are excessively optimistic, it can contract the money supply to raise 
interest rates and dampen aggregate demand. Former Fed Chairman William 
McChesney Martin described this view of monetary policy very simply: “The 
Federal Reserve’s job is to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going.”

Keynesians in the White House
When a reporter in 1961 asked President John F. Kennedy why he advocated a 
tax cut, Kennedy replied, “To stimulate the economy. Don’t you remember your 
Economics 101?” Kennedy’s policy was, in fact, based on the analysis of fiscal 
policy we have developed in this chapter. His goal was to enact a tax cut, which 
would raise consumer spending, expand aggregate demand, and increase the 
economy’s production and employment.
	
In choosing this policy, Kennedy was relying on his team of economic advisers. 
This team included such prominent economists as James Tobin and Robert Solow, 
who later would win Nobel Prizes for their contributions to economics. As stu-
dents in the 1940s, these economists had closely studied John Maynard Keynes’s 
General Theory, which then was only a few years old. When the Kennedy advisers 
proposed cutting taxes, they were putting Keynes’s ideas into action.
	
Although tax changes can have a potent influence on aggregate demand, they 
have other effects as well. In particular, by changing the incentives that people 
face, taxes can alter the aggregate supply of goods and services. Part of the 
Kennedy proposal was an investment tax credit, which gives a tax break to firms 
that invest in new capital. Higher investment would not only stimulate aggregate 
demand immediately but also increase the economy’s productive capacity over 
time. Thus, the short-run goal of increasing production through higher aggregate 
demand was coupled with a long-run goal of increasing production through 
higher aggregate supply. And indeed, when the tax cut Kennedy proposed was 
finally enacted in 1964, it helped usher in a period of robust economic growth.
	
Since the 1964 tax cut, policymakers have from time to time used fiscal policy 
as a tool for controlling aggregate demand. For example, when President Barack 
Obama moved into the Oval Office in 2009, he faced an economy in the midst 
of a recession. One of his first policy initiatives was a stimulus bill that included 
substantial increases in government spending. The accompanying In the News 
box discusses some of the debate over this policy initiative. ■
The Case against Active Stabilization Policy
Some economists argue that the government should avoid active use of monetary 
and fiscal policy to try to stabilize the economy. They claim that these policy instru-
ments should be set to achieve long-run goals, such as rapid economic growth and 
low inflation, and that the economy should be left to deal with short-run fluctua-
tions on its own. These economists may admit that monetary and fiscal policy can 
stabilize the economy in theory, but they doubt whether it can do so in practice.
The primary argument against active monetary and fiscal policy is that these 
policies affect the economy with a long lag. As we have seen, monetary policy 
works by changing interest rates, which in turn influence investment spending. 
But many firms make investment plans far in advance. Thus, most economists 
believe that it takes at least six months for changes in monetary policy to have 
much effect on output and employment. Moreover, once these effects occur, they 
can last for several years. Critics of stabilization policy argue that because of this 
lag, the Fed should not try to fine-tune the economy. They claim that the Fed often 
reacts too late to changing economic conditions and, as a result, ends up being 
a cause of rather than a cure for economic fluctuations. These critics advocate a 
passive monetary policy, such as slow and steady growth in the money supply.

Fiscal policy also works with a lag, but unlike the lag in monetary policy, the 
lag in fiscal policy is largely attributable to the political process. In the United 
States, most changes in government spending and taxes must go through con-
gressional committees in both the House and the Senate, be passed by both 
legislative bodies, and then be signed by the president. Completing this process 
can take months or, in some cases, years. By the time the change in fiscal policy 
is passed and ready to implement, the condition of the economy may well have 
changed.
These lags in monetary and fiscal policy are a problem in part because economic 
forecasting is so imprecise. If forecasters could accurately predict the condition of 
the economy a year in advance, then monetary and fiscal policymakers could look 
ahead when making policy decisions. In this case, policymakers could stabilize 
the economy despite the lags they face. In practice, however, major recessions and 
depressions arrive without much advance warning. The best policymakers can do 
at any time is to respond to economic changes as they occur.
Much Ado about 
Multipliers
I
t is the biggest peacetime fiscal expansion 
in history. Across the globe countries have 
countered the recession by cutting taxes and 
by boosting government spending. The G20 
group of economies, whose leaders meet 
this week in Pittsburgh, have introduced 
stimulus packages worth an average of 2% 
of GDP this year and 1.6% of GDP in 2010. 
Co-ordinated action on this scale might sug-
gest a consensus about the effects of fiscal 
stimulus. But economists are in fact deeply 
divided about how well, or indeed whether, 
such stimulus works. 
	
The debate hinges on the scale of the 
“fiscal multiplier”. This measure, first for-
malised in 1931 by Richard Kahn, a student 
of John Maynard Keynes, captures how 
effectively tax cuts or increases in govern-
ment spending stimulate output. A multi-
plier of one means that a $1 billion increase 
in government spending will increase a 
country’s GDP by $1 billion.
	
The size of the multiplier is bound to vary 
according to economic conditions. For an 
economy operating at full capacity, the fiscal 
multiplier should be zero. Since there are no 
spare resources, any increase in government 
demand would just replace spending else-
where. But in a recession, when workers and 
factories lie idle, a fiscal boost can increase 
overall demand. And if the initial stimulus 
triggers a cascade of expenditure among 
consumers and businesses, the multiplier 
can be well above one. 
	
The multiplier is also likely to vary accord-
ing to the type of fiscal action. Government 
spending on building a bridge may have a 
bigger multiplier than a tax cut if consumers 
save a portion of their tax windfall. A tax cut 
targeted at poorer people may have a bigger 
impact on spending than one for the afflu-
ent, since poorer folk tend to spend a higher 
share of their income.
	
Crucially, the overall size of the fiscal 
multiplier also depends on how people 
react to higher government borrowing. If 
the government’s actions bolster confidence 
and revive animal spirits, the multiplier 
could rise as demand goes up and private 
investment is “crowded in.” But if interest 
rates climb in response to government bor-
rowing then some private investment that 
would otherwise have occurred could get 
“crowded out.” And if consumers expect 
higher future taxes in order to finance new 
government borrowing, they could spend 
 How Large Is the Fiscal Policy Multiplier?
In the global economic downturn of 2008 and 2009, governments 
around the world turned to fiscal policy to prop up aggregate demand.

Automatic Stabilizers
All economists—both advocates and critics of stabilization policy—agree that the 
lags in implementation render policy less useful as a tool for short-run stabiliza-
tion. The economy would be more stable, therefore, if policymakers could find 
a way to avoid some of these lags. In fact, they have. Automatic stabilizers are 
changes in fiscal policy that stimulate aggregate demand when the economy goes 
into a recession without policymakers having to take any deliberate action.
The most important automatic stabilizer is the tax system. When the economy 
goes into a recession, the amount of taxes collected by the government falls 
automatically because almost all taxes are closely tied to economic activity. The 
personal income tax depends on households’ incomes, the payroll tax depends 
on workers’ earnings, and the corporate income tax depends on firms’ profits. 
Because incomes, earnings, and profits all fall in a recession, the government’s tax 
revenue falls as well. This automatic tax cut stimulates aggregate demand and, 
thereby, reduces the magnitude of economic fluctuations.

less today. All that would reduce the fiscal 
multiplier, potentially to below zero. 
	
Different assumptions about the impact 
of higher government borrowing on inter-
est rates and private spending explain wild 
variations in the estimates of multipliers 
from today’s stimulus spending. Economists 
in the Obama administration, who assume 
that the federal funds rate stays constant for 
a four-year period, expect a multiplier of 1.6 
for government purchases and 1.0 for tax 
cuts from America’s fiscal stimulus. An alter-
native assessment by John Cogan, Tobias 
Cwik, John Taylor and Volker Wieland uses 
models in which interest rates and taxes 
rise more quickly in response to higher 
public borrowing. Their multipliers are much 
smaller. They think America’s stimulus will 
boost GDP by only one-sixth as much as the 
Obama team expects. 
	
When forward-looking models disagree 
so dramatically, careful analysis of previ-
ous fiscal stimuli ought to help settle 
the debate. Unfortunately, it is extremely 
tricky to isolate the impact of changes 
in fiscal policy. One approach is to use 
microeconomic case studies to examine 
consumer behaviour in response to specific 
tax rebates and cuts. These studies, largely 
based on tax changes in America, find that 
permanent cuts have a bigger impact on 
consumer spending than temporary ones 
and that consumers who find it hard to 
borrow, such as those close to their credit-
card limit, tend to spend more of their tax 
windfall. But case studies do not measure 
the overall impact of tax cuts or spending 
increases on output. 
	
An alternative approach is to try to tease 
out the statistical impact of changes in 
government spending or tax cuts on GDP. 
The difficulty here is to isolate the effects 
of fiscal-stimulus measures from the rises 
in social-security spending and falls in tax 
revenues that naturally accompany reces-
sions. This empirical approach has narrowed 
the range of estimates in some areas. It has 
also yielded interesting cross-country com-
parisons. Multipliers are bigger in closed 
economies than open ones (because less of 
the stimulus leaks abroad via imports). They 
have traditionally been bigger in rich coun-
tries than emerging ones (where investors 
tend to take fright more quickly, pushing 
interest rates up). But overall economists 
find as big a range of multipliers from 
empirical estimates as they do from theo-
retical models. 
	
To add to the confusion, the post-war 
experiences from which statistical analyses 
are drawn differ in vital respects from the 
current situation. Most of the evidence 
on multipliers for government spending 
is based on military outlays, but today’s 
stimulus packages are heavily focused on 
infrastructure. Interest rates in many rich 
countries are now close to zero, which may 
increase the potency of, as well as the need 
for, fiscal stimulus. Because of the financial 
crisis relatively more people face borrow-
ing constraints, which would increase the 
effectiveness of a tax cut. At the same time, 
highly indebted consumers may now be 
keen to cut their borrowing, leading to a 
lower multiplier. And investors today have 
more reason to be worried about rich coun-
tries’ fiscal positions than those of emerging 
markets. 
	
Add all this together and the truth is that 
economists are flying blind. They can make 
relative judgments with some confidence. 
Temporary tax cuts pack less punch than 
permanent ones, for instance. Fiscal multipli-
ers will probably be lower in heavily indebted 
economies than in prudent ones. But poli-
cymakers looking for precise estimates are 
deluding themselves.

Government spending also acts as an automatic stabilizer. In particular, when 
the economy goes into a recession and workers are laid off, more people apply 
for unemployment insurance benefits, welfare benefits, and other forms of income 
support. This automatic increase in government spending stimulates aggregate 
demand at exactly the time when aggregate demand is insufficient to maintain 
full employment. Indeed, when the unemployment insurance system was first 
enacted in the 1930s, economists who advocated this policy did so in part because 
of its power as an automatic stabilizer.
The automatic stabilizers in the U.S. economy are not sufficiently strong to prevent 
recessions completely. Nonetheless, without these automatic stabilizers, output and 
employment would probably be more volatile than they are. For this reason, many 
economists oppose a constitutional amendment that would require the federal gov-
ernment always to run a balanced budget, as some politicians have proposed. When 
the economy goes into a recession, taxes fall, government spending rises, and the 
government’s budget moves toward deficit. If the government faced a strict balanced-
budget rule, it would be forced to look for ways to raise taxes or cut spending in a 
recession. In other words, a strict balanced-budget rule would eliminate the auto-
matic stabilizers inherent in our current system of taxes and government spending.

and people become pessimistic about the future. What happens to aggregate 
demand? If the Fed wants to stabilize aggregate demand, how should it alter the 
money supply? If it does this, what happens to the interest rate? Why might the Fed 
choose not to respond in this way?

 Offbeat Indicators
Because monetary and fiscal policy work with long lags, policymakers 
are constantly searching for clues about where the economy is heading.

Economic Numbers 
Befuddle Even the Best
By George Hager
E
conomists pore over scores of numbers 
every week, trying to sense when the 
recession is over. But quirky indicators and 
gut instinct might be almost as helpful—
maybe even more so.
	
Is your dentist busy? Dentists say people 
put off appointments when times turn tough, 
then reschedule when the economy improves.
	
How far away do you have to park when 
you go to the mall? Fewer shoppers equal 
more parking spaces. 
	
If you drive to work, has your commute 
time gotten shorter or longer?
	
Economist Michael Evans says a col-
league with a pipeline into the garbage 
business swears by his own homegrown 
Chicago Trash index. Collections plunged 
after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, rebounded 
in October but then fell off again in mid-
November. “Trash is a pretty good indi-
cator of what people are buying,” says 
Evans, an economist with Evans Carrol & 
Associates. “They’ve got to throw out the 
wrappings.” . . .
	
What’s actually happening is often 
clear only in hindsight. That’s one reason 
the National Bureau of Economic Research 
waited until November to declare that a 
recession began last March—and why it 
took them until December 1992 to declare 
that the last recession had ended more than 
a year earlier, in March 1991.
	
“The data can fail you,” says Allen Sinai, 
chief economist for Decision Economics. Sinai 
cautions that if numbers appear to be going 
up (or down), it’s best to wait to see what 
happens over two or three months before 
drawing a conclusion—something hairtrig-
ger financial markets routinely don’t do.
	
“We have lots of false predictions of 
recoveries by (stock) markets that don’t 
happen,” he says.
	
Like a lot of economists, Sinai leavens 
the numbers with informal observations. 
These days, he’s paying particular atten-
tion to what business executives say at 
meetings and cocktail parties because their 
mood—and their plans for investing and 
hiring—are key to a comeback.
	
Even the Federal Reserve, whose more 
than 200 economists monitor about every 
piece of the economy that can be mea-
sured, make room for anecdotes. Two 
weeks before every policy meeting, the Fed 
publishes its “beige book,” a survey based 
on off-the-record conversations between 
officials at the Fed’s 12 regional banks and 
local businesses.
	
The 
reports 
are 
peppered 
with 
quotes from unnamed business people 
(“Everybody’s decided to go shopping 
again,” someone told the Richmond Fed 
Bank last month) and the occasional odd 
detail that reveals just how far down the 
Fed inquisitors sometimes drill. Last March, 
the Dallas Fed Bank reported “healthy sales 
of singing gorillas” for Valentine’s Day.

Summary
Conclusion
• In developing a theory of short-run economic 
fluctuations, Keynes proposed the theory of 
liquidity preference to explain the determinants 
of the interest rate. According to this theory, the 
interest rate adjusts to balance the supply and 
demand for money. 
• An increase in the price level raises money 
demand and increases the interest rate that 
brings the money market into equilibrium. 
Because the interest rate represents the cost 
of borrowing, a higher interest rate reduces 
investment and, thereby, the quantity of goods 
and services demanded. The downward-sloping 
aggregate-demand curve expresses this nega-
tive relationship between the price level and the 
quantity demanded.
• Policymakers can influence aggregate demand 
with monetary policy. An increase in the money 
supply reduces the equilibrium interest rate for 
any given price level. Because a lower interest rate 
stimulates investment spending, the aggregate-
demand curve shifts to the right. Conversely, a 
decrease in the money supply raises the equilib-
rium interest rate for any given price level and 
shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.
• Policymakers can also influence aggregate demand 
with fiscal policy. An increase in government 
purchases or a cut in taxes shifts the aggregate-
demand curve to the right. A decrease in govern-
ment purchases or an increase in taxes shifts the 
aggregate-demand curve to the left.
• When the government alters spending or taxes, 
the resulting shift in aggregate demand can be 
larger or smaller than the fiscal change. The mul-
tiplier effect tends to amplify the effects of fiscal 
policy on aggregate demand. The crowding-out 
effect tends to dampen the effects of fiscal policy 
on aggregate demand.
• Because monetary and fiscal policy can influence 
aggregate demand, the government sometimes 
uses these policy instruments in an attempt 
to stabilize the economy. Economists disagree 
about how active the government should be in 
this effort. According to advocates of active sta-
bilization policy, changes in attitudes by house-
holds and firms shift aggregate demand; if the 
government does not respond, the result is 
undesirable and unnecessary fluctuations in 
output and employment. According to critics of 
active stabilization policy, monetary and fiscal 
policy work with such long lags that attempts 
at stabilizing the economy often end up being 
destabilizing. 
Before policymakers make any change in policy, they need to consider all the 
effects of their decisions. Earlier in the book, we examined classical models of 
the economy, which describe the long-run effects of monetary and fiscal policy. 
There we saw how fiscal policy influences saving, investment, and long-run 
growth and how monetary policy influences the price level and the inflation 
rate.
In this chapter, we examined the short-run effects of monetary and fiscal 
policy. We saw how these policy instruments can change the aggregate demand 
for goods and services and alter the economy’s production and employment 
in the short run. When Congress reduces government spending to balance the 
budget, it needs to consider both the long-run effects on saving and growth 
and the short-run effects on aggregate demand and employment. When the 
Fed reduces the growth rate of the money supply, it must take into account 
the long-run effect on inflation as well as the short-run effect on production. 
In all parts of government, policymakers must keep in mind both long-run and 
short-run goals.

billion below its natural rate, and fiscal policy-
makers want to close this recessionary gap. The 
central bank agrees to adjust the money supply 
to hold the interest rate constant, so there is 
no crowding out. The marginal propensity to 
consume is 4∕5, and the price level is completely 
fixed in the short run. In what direction and by 
how much would government spending need 
to change to close the recessionary gap? Explain 
your thinking.
	10.	 Suppose government spending increases. 
Would the effect on aggregate demand be 
larger if the Federal Reserve held the money 
supply constant in response or if the Fed were

Explain.
	11.	 In which of the following circumstances is 
expansionary fiscal policy more likely to lead to 
a short-run increase in investment? Explain.
a.	 When the investment accelerator is large or 
when it is small?
b.	When the interest sensitivity of investment is 
large or when it is small?
	12.	 For various reasons, fiscal policy changes auto-
matically when output and employment fluctuate.
a.	 Explain why tax revenue changes when the 
economy goes into a recession.
b.	Explain why government spending changes 
when the economy goes into a recession.
c.	 If the government were to operate under a 
strict balanced-budget rule, what would it

a.	 How would the Fed respond to an event that 
contracted aggregate demand?
b.	How would the Fed respond to an event that 
caused an adverse shift in short-run aggre-
gate supply? 
In each case, is there another monetary policy that 
would lead to greater stability in output?
