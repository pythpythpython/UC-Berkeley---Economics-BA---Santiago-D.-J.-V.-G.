Aggregate Demand  
     and Aggregate Supply
E
conomic activity fluctuates from year to year. In most years, the produc-
tion of goods and services rises. Because of increases in the labor force, 
increases in the capital stock, and advances in technological knowledge, 
the economy can produce more and more over time. This growth allows 
everyone to enjoy a higher standard of living. On average over the past half cen-
tury, the production of the U.S. economy as measured by real GDP has grown by 
about 3 percent per year. 
In some years, however, the economy experiences contraction rather than 
growth. Firms find themselves unable to sell all the goods and services they have 
to offer, so they cut back on production. Workers are laid off, unemployment 
rises, and factories are left idle. With the economy producing fewer goods and 
services, real GDP and other measures of income fall. Such a period of falling 
incomes and rising unemployment is called a recession if it is relatively mild and 
a depression if it is more severe.

An example of such a downturn occurred in 2008 and 2009. From the fourth 
quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2009, real GDP for the U.S. economy fell by 
4 percent. The rate of unemployment rose from 4.4 percent in May 2007 to 10.1 percent 
in October 2009—the highest level in more than a quarter century. Not surprisingly, 
students graduating during this time found that desirable jobs were hard to find.
What causes short-run fluctuations in economic activity? What, if anything, can 
public policy do to prevent periods of falling incomes and rising unemployment? 
When recessions and depressions occur, how can policymakers reduce their 
length and severity? These are the questions we take up now.
The variables that we study are largely those we have already seen in previous 
chapters. They include GDP, unemployment, interest rates, and the price level. Also 
familiar are the policy instruments of government spending, taxes, and the money 
supply. What differs from our earlier analysis is the time horizon. So far, our goal 
has been to explain the behavior of these variables in the long run. Our goal now is 
to explain their short-run deviations from long-run trends. In other words, instead of 
focusing on the forces that explain economic growth from generation to generation, we 
are now interested in the forces that explain economic fluctuations from year to year.
There remains some debate among economists about how best to analyze 
short-run fluctuations, but most economists use the model of aggregate demand 
and aggregate supply. Learning how to use this model for analyzing the short-run 
effects of various events and policies is the primary task ahead. This chapter intro-
duces the model’s two pieces: the aggregate-demand curve and the aggregate-
supply curve. Before turning to the model, however, let’s look at some of the key 
facts that describe the ups and downs of the economy.
Three Key Facts about Economic Fluctuations
Short-run fluctuations in economic activity have occurred in all countries through-
out history. As a starting point for understanding these year-to-year fluctuations, 
let’s discuss some of their most important properties.
Fact 1: Economic Fluctuations Are Irregular  
and Unpredictable
Fluctuations in the economy are often called the business cycle. As this term suggests, 
economic fluctuations correspond to changes in business conditions. When real 
GDP grows rapidly, business is good. During such periods of economic expansion, 
most firms find that customers are plentiful and that profits are growing. When 
real GDP falls during recessions, businesses have trouble. During such periods of 
economic contraction, most firms experience declining sales and dwindling profits. 
The term business cycle is somewhat misleading because it suggests that eco-
nomic fluctuations follow a regular, predictable pattern. In fact, economic fluctua-
tions are not at all regular, and they are almost impossible to predict with much 
accuracy. Panel (a) of Figure 1 shows the real GDP of the U.S. economy since 1965. 
The shaded areas represent times of recession. As the figure shows, recessions do 
not come at regular intervals. Sometimes recessions are close together, such as the 
recessions of 1980 and 1982. Sometimes the economy goes many years without a 
recession. The longest period in U.S. history without a recession was the economic 
expansion from 1991 to 2001.

Fact 2: Most Macroeconomic Quantities  
Fluctuate Together
Real GDP is the variable most commonly used to monitor short-run changes in 
the economy because it is the most comprehensive measure of economic activity. 
Real GDP measures the value of all final goods and services produced within a 
given period of time. It also measures the total income (adjusted for inflation) of 
everyone in the economy.
It turns out, however, that for monitoring short-run fluctuations, it does not 
really matter which measure of economic activity one looks at. Most macroeco-
nomic variables that measure some type of income, spending, or production fluc-
tuate closely together. When real GDP falls in a recession, so do personal income, 
corporate profits, consumer spending, investment spending, industrial production, 
retail sales, home sales, auto sales, and so on. Because recessions are economy-wide 
phenomena, they show up in many sources of macroeconomic data.
Although many macroeconomic variables fluctuate together, they fluctuate by 
different amounts. In particular, as panel (b) of Figure 1 shows, investment spend-
ing varies greatly over the business cycle. Even though investment averages about 
one-seventh of GDP, declines in investment account for about two-thirds of the 
declines in GDP during recessions. In other words, when economic conditions 
deteriorate, much of the decline is attributable to reductions in spending on new 
factories, housing, and inventories.
Fact 3: As Output Falls, Unemployment Rises
Changes in the economy’s output of goods and services are strongly correlated 
with changes in the economy’s utilization of its labor force. In other words, when 
real GDP declines, the rate of unemployment rises. This fact is hardly surprising: 
When firms choose to produce a smaller quantity of goods and services, they lay 
off workers, expanding the pool of unemployed. 
Panel (c) of Figure 1 shows the unemployment rate in the U.S. economy since 
1965. Once again, the shaded areas in the figure indicate periods of recession. The 
figure shows clearly the impact of recessions on unemployment. In each of the 
recessions, the unemployment rate rises substantially. When the recession ends 
and real GDP starts to expand, the unemployment rate gradually declines. The 
unemployment rate never approaches zero; instead, it fluctuates around its natural 
rate of about 5 or 6 percent.
QUICK QUIZ  List and discuss three key facts about economic fluctuations.
Explaining Short-Run Economic Fluctuations
Describing what happens to economies as they fluctuate over time is easy. 
Explaining what causes these fluctuations is more difficult. Indeed, compared to the 
topics we have studied in previous chapters, the theory of economic fluctuations 
remains controversial. In this and the next two chapters, we develop the model that 
most economists use to explain short-run fluctuations in economic activity.
The Assumptions of Classical Economics
In previous chapters, we developed theories to explain what determines most 
important macroeconomic variables in the long run. Chapter      explained the

CHAPTER 33    Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply
level and growth of productivity and real GDP. Chapters 26 and 27 explained 
how the financial system works and how the real interest rate adjusts to balance 
saving and investment. Chapter 28 explained why there is always some unem-
ployment in the economy. Chapters 29 and 30 explained the monetary system 
and how changes in the money supply affect the price level, the inflation rate, 
and the nominal interest rate. Chapters 31 and 32 extended this analysis to open 
economies to explain the trade balance and the exchange rate.
All of this previous analysis was based on two related ideas: the classical 
dichotomy and monetary neutrality. Recall that the classical dichotomy is the 
separation of variables into real variables (those that measure quantities or rela-
tive prices) and nominal variables (those measured in terms of money). According 
to classical macroeconomic theory, changes in the money supply affect nominal 
variables but not real variables. As a result of this monetary neutrality, Chapters 
25 through 28 were able to examine the determinants of real variables (real GDP, 
the real interest rate, and unemployment) without introducing nominal variables 
(the money supply and the price level).
In a sense, money does not matter in a classical world. If the quantity of money 
in the economy were to double, everything would cost twice as much, and every-
one’s income would be twice as high. But so what? The change would be nominal 
(by the standard meaning of “nearly insignificant”). The things that people really 
care about—whether they have a job, how many goods and services they can 
afford, and so on—would be exactly the same. 
This classical view is sometimes described by the saying, “Money is a veil.” 
That is, nominal variables may be the first things we see when we observe an 
economy because economic variables are often expressed in units of money. But 
what’s important are the real variables and the economic forces that determine 
them. According to classical theory, to understand these real variables, we need 
to look behind the veil. 
The Reality of Short-Run Fluctuations
Do these assumptions of classical macroeconomic theory apply to the world in 
which we live? The answer to this question is of central importance to under-
standing how the economy works. Most economists believe that classical theory 
describes the world in the long run but not in the short run. 
Consider again the impact of money on the economy. Most economists believe 
that, beyond a period of several years, changes in the money supply affect prices 
and other nominal variables but do not affect real GDP, unemployment, or other 
real variables—just as classical theory says. When studying year-to-year changes 
in the economy, however, the assumption of monetary neutrality is no longer 
appropriate. In the short run, real and nominal variables are highly intertwined, 
and changes in the money supply can temporarily push real GDP away from its 
long-run trend.
Even the classical economists themselves, such as David Hume, realized that 
classical economic theory did not hold in the short run. From his vantage point 
in 18th-century England, Hume observed that when the money supply expanded 
after gold discoveries, it took some time for prices to rise, and in the meantime, 
the economy enjoyed higher employment and production.
To understand how the economy works in the short run, we need a new 
model. This new model can be built using many of the tools we developed

in previous chapters, but it must abandon the classical dichotomy and the 
neutrality of money. We can no longer separate our analysis of real variables 
such as output and employment from our analysis of nominal variables such 
as money and the price level. Our new model focuses on how real and nominal 
variables interact. 
The Model of Aggregate Demand and  
Aggregate Supply
Our model of short-run economic fluctuations focuses on the behavior of two 
variables. The first variable is the economy’s output of goods and services, as mea-
sured by real GDP. The second is the average level of prices, as measured by the 
CPI or the GDP deflator. Notice that output is a real variable, whereas the price 
level is a nominal variable. By focusing on the relationship between these two 
variables, we are departing from the classical assumption that real and nominal 
variables can be studied separately. 
Recession Can 
Change a Way of Life 
By Tyler Cowen
A
s job losses mount and bailout costs 
run into the trillions, the social costs of 
the economic downturn become clearer. The 
primary question, to be sure, is what can be 
done to shorten or alleviate these bad times. 
But there is also a broader set of questions 
about how this downturn is changing our 
lives, in ways beyond strict economics. 
	
All recessions have cultural and social 
effects, but in major downturns the changes 
can be profound. The Great Depression, for 
example, may be regarded as a social and 
cultural era as well as an economic one. 
And the current crisis is also likely to enact 
changes in various areas, from our enter-
tainment habits to our health.
	
First, consider entertainment. Many stud-
ies have shown that when a job is harder 
to find or less lucrative, people spend more 
time on self-improvement and relatively inex-
pensive amusements. During the Depression 
of the 1930s, that meant listening to the 
radio and playing parlor and board games, 
sometimes in lieu of a glamorous night on 
the town. These stay-at-home tendencies 
persisted through at least the 1950s. 
	
In today’s recession, we can also expect 
to turn to less expensive activities—and 
maybe to keep those habits for years. They 
may take the form of greater interest in free 
content on the Internet and the simple plea-
sures of a daily walk, instead of expensive 
vacations and N.B.A. box seats.
	
In any recession, the poor suffer the most 
pain. But in cultural influence, it may well be 
the rich who lose the most in the current crisis. 
This downturn is bringing a larger-than-usual 
decline in consumption by the wealthy. 
	
The shift has been documented by Jonathan 
A. Parker and Annette Vissing-Jorgenson, finance 
professors at North­western University, in their 
recent paper, “Who Bears Aggregate Fluctua­
tions and How? Estimates and Implications for 
Consumption Inequality.” Of course, people who 
held much wealth in real estate or stocks have 
taken heavy losses. But most important, the 
 The Social Influences of Economic 
Downturns
The U.S. economy experienced a deep recession in 2008 and 2009, from 
which the economy was just beginning to recover as this book went to 
press. This event led some observers to ask how such events affect society 
more broadly.

We analyze fluctuations in the economy as a whole with the model of 
­aggregate demand and aggregate supply, which is illustrated in Figure 2. On 
the vertical axis is the overall price level in the economy. On the horizontal axis 
is the overall quantity of goods and services produced in the economy. The 
­aggregate-demand curve shows the quantity of goods and services that house-
holds, firms, the government, and customers abroad want to buy at each price 
level. The aggregate-supply curve shows the quantity of goods and services that 
firms produce and sell at each price level. According to this model, the price level 
and the quantity of output adjust to bring aggregate demand and aggregate sup-
ply into balance.
It is tempting to view the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply 
as nothing more than a large version of the model of market demand and market 
supply introduced in Chapter 4. In fact, this model is quite different. When we 
consider demand and supply in a specific market—ice cream, for instance—the 
behavior of buyers and sellers depends on the ability of resources to move from 
one market to another. When the price of ice cream rises, the quantity demanded 
falls because buyers will use their incomes to buy products other than ice cream.

paper says, the labor incomes of high earners 
have declined more than in past recessions, as 
seen in the financial sector. 
	
Popular culture’s catering to the wealthy 
may also decline in this downturn. We can 
expect a shift away from the lionizing of 
fancy restaurants, for example, and toward 
more use of public libraries. Such changes 
tend to occur in downturns, but this time 
they may be especially pronounced.
	
Recessions and depressions, of course, 
are not good for mental health. But it is 
less widely known that in the United States 
and other affluent countries, physical health 
seems to improve, on average, during a 
downturn. Sure, it’s stressful to miss a pay-
check, but eliminating the stresses of a job 
may have some beneficial effects. Perhaps 
more important, people may take fewer car 
trips, thus lowering the risk of accidents, and 
spend less on alcohol and tobacco. They also 
have more time for exercise and sleep, and 
tend to choose home cooking over fast food.
	
In a 2003 paper, “Healthy Living in Hard 
Times,” Christopher J. Ruhm, an econo-
mist at the University of North Carolina 
at Greensboro, found that the death rate 
falls as unemployment rises. In the United 
States, he found, a 1 percent increase in the 
unemployment rate, on average, decreases 
the death rate by 0.5 percent.
	
David Potts studied the social history of 
Australia in the 1930s in his 2006 book, “The 
Myth of the Great Depression.” Australia’s 
suicide rate spiked in 1930, but overall health 
improved and death rates declined; after 
1930, suicide rates declined as well. 
	
While he found in interviews that many 
people reminisced fondly about those 
depression years, we shouldn’t rush to con-
clude that depressions are happy times.
	
Many of their reports are likely illusory, 
as documented by the Harvard psycholo-
gist Daniel Gilbert in his best-selling book 
“Stumbling on Happiness.” According to 
Professor Gilbert, people often have rosy 
memories of very trying periods, which may 
include extreme poverty or fighting in a war.
	
In today’s context, we are also suffering 
fear and anxiety for the rather dubious con-
solation of having some interesting memo-
ries for the distant future.
	
But this downturn will likely mean a 
more prudent generation to come. That is 
implied by the work of two professors, Ulrike 
Malmendier of the University of California, 
Berkeley, and Stefan Nagel of the Stanford 
Business School, in a 2007 paper, “Depression 
Babies: Do Macroeconomic Experiences Affect 
Risk-Taking?”
	
A generation that grows up in a period 
of low stock returns is likely to take an 
unusually cautious approach to invest-
ing, even decades later, the paper found. 
Similarly, a generation that grows up with 
high inflation will be more cautious about 
buying bonds decades later.
	
In other words, today’s teenagers stand 
less chance of making foolish decisions in 
the stock market down the road. They are 
likely to forgo some good business opportu-
nities, but also to make fewer mistakes.
	
When all is said and done, something 
terrible has happened in the United States 
economy, and no one should wish for such 
an event. But a deeper look at the down-
turn, and the social changes it is bringing, 
shows a more complex picture.
	
In addition to trying to get out of the 
recession—our first priority—many of us 
will be making do with less and relying more 
on ourselves and our families. The social 
changes may well be the next big story of 
this recession.

Similarly, a higher price of ice cream raises the quantity supplied because firms 
that produce ice cream can increase production by hiring workers away from 
other parts of the economy. This microeconomic substitution from one market to 
another is impossible for the economy as a whole. After all, the quantity that our 
model is trying to explain—real GDP—measures the total quantity of goods and 
services produced by all firms in all markets. To understand why the aggregate-
demand curve is downward sloping and why the aggregate-supply curve is 
upward sloping, we need a macroeconomic theory that explains the total quantity 
of goods and services demanded and the total quantity of goods and services sup-
plied. Developing such a theory is our next task.
QUICK QUIZ  How does the economy’s behavior in the short run differ from its 
behavior in the long run? • Draw the model of aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply. What variables are on the two axes?
The Aggregate-Demand Curve
The aggregate-demand curve tells us the quantity of all goods and services 
demanded in the economy at any given price level. As Figure 3 illustrates, the 
aggregate-demand curve is downward sloping. This means that, other things 
equal, a decrease in the economy’s overall level of prices (from, say, P1 to P2) raises 
the quantity of goods and services demanded (from Y1 to Y2). Conversely, an 
increase in the price level reduces the quantity of goods and services demanded.
Why the Aggregate-Demand Curve  
Slopes Downward
Why does a change in the price level move the quantity of goods and services 
demanded in the opposite direction? To answer this question, it is useful to recall

that an economy’s GDP (which we denote as Y) is the sum of its consumption (C), 
investment (I), government purchases (G), and net exports (NX):
Y = C + I + G + NX.
Each of these four components contributes to the aggregate demand for goods 
and services. For now, we assume that government spending is fixed by policy. 
The other three components of spending—consumption, investment, and net 
exports—depend on economic conditions and, in particular, on the price level. 
Therefore, to understand the downward slope of the aggregate-demand curve, 
we must examine how the price level affects the quantity of goods and services 
demanded for consumption, investment, and net exports. 
The Price Level and Consumption: The Wealth Effect  Consider the 
money that you hold in your wallet and your bank account. The nominal value of 
this money is fixed: One dollar is always worth one dollar. Yet the real value of a 
dollar is not fixed. If a candy bar costs one dollar, then a dollar is worth one candy 
bar. If the price of a candy bar falls to 50 cents, then one dollar is worth two candy 
bars. Thus, when the price level falls, the dollars you are holding rise in value, 
which increases your real wealth and your ability to buy goods and services. 
This logic gives us the first reason the aggregate demand curve is downward 
sloping. A decrease in the price level raises the real value of money and makes consumers 
wealthier, which in turn encourages them to spend more. The increase in consumer spend-
ing means a larger quantity of goods and services demanded. Conversely, an increase in 
the price level reduces the real value of money and makes consumers poorer, which in turn 
reduces consumer spending and the quantity of goods and services demanded. 
The Price Level and Investment: The Interest-Rate Effect  The price level 
is one determinant of the quantity of money demanded. When the price level is 
lower, households need to hold less money to buy the goods and services they 
want. Therefore, when the price level falls, households try to reduce their holdings 
The Aggregate-Demand Curve
Figure 3
A fall in the price level from P1 to 
P2 increases the quantity of goods 
and services demanded from Y1 
to Y2. There are three reasons 
for this negative relationship. As 
the price level falls, real wealth 
rises, interest rates fall, and 
the exchange rate depreciates. 
These effects stimulate spending 
on consumption, investment, 
and net exports. Increased 
spending on any or all of these 
components of output means 
a larger quantity of goods and 
services demanded.

of money by lending some of it out. For instance, a household might use its excess 
money to buy interest-bearing bonds. Or it might deposit its excess money in an 
interest-bearing savings account, and the bank would use these funds to make 
more loans. In either case, as households try to convert some of their money into 
interest-bearing assets, they drive down interest rates. (The next chapter analyzes 
this process in more detail.)
Interest rates, in turn, affect spending on goods and services. Because a lower 
interest rate makes borrowing less expensive, it encourages firms to borrow more 
to invest in new plants and equipment, and it encourages households to borrow 
more to invest in new housing. (A lower interest rate might also stimulate con-
sumer spending, especially spending on large durable purchases such as cars, 
which are often bought on credit.) Thus, a lower interest rate increases the quan-
tity of goods and services demanded.
This logic gives us a second reason the aggregate demand curve is downward 
sloping. A lower price level reduces the interest rate, encourages greater spending on 
investment goods, and thereby increases the quantity of goods and services demanded. 
Conversely, a higher price level raises the interest rate, discourages investment spending, 
and decreases the quantity of goods and services demanded.
The Price Level and Net Exports: The Exchange-Rate Effect  As we have 
just discussed, a lower price level in the United States lowers the U.S. interest rate. 
In response to the lower interest rate, some U.S. investors will seek higher returns by 
investing abroad. For instance, as the interest rate on U.S. government bonds falls, a 
mutual fund might sell U.S. government bonds to buy German government bonds. 
As the mutual fund tries to convert its dollars into euros to buy the German bonds, 
it increases the supply of dollars in the market for foreign-currency exchange. 
The increased supply of dollars to be turned into euros causes the dollar to depre-
ciate relative to the euro. This leads to a change in the real exchange rate—the relative 
price of domestic and foreign goods. Because each dollar buys fewer units of foreign 
currencies, foreign goods become more expensive relative to domestic goods. 
The change in relative prices affects spending, both at home and abroad. 
Because foreign goods are now more expensive, Americans buy less from other 
countries, causing U.S. imports of goods and services to decrease. At the same 
time, because U.S. goods are now cheaper, foreigners buy more from the United 
States, so U.S. exports increase. Net exports equal exports minus imports, so 
both of these changes cause U.S. net exports to increase. Thus, the fall in the real 
exchange value of the dollar leads to an increase in the quantity of goods and 
services demanded.
This logic yields a third reason the aggregate demand curve is downward slop-
ing. When a fall in the U.S. price level causes U.S. interest rates to fall, the real value 
of the dollar declines in foreign exchange markets. This depreciation stimulates U.S. net 
exports and thereby increases the quantity of goods and services demanded. Conversely, 
when the U.S. price level rises and causes U.S. interest rates to rise, the real value of the 
dollar increases, and this appreciation reduces U.S. net exports and the quantity of goods 
and services demanded.
Summing Up  There are three distinct but related reasons a fall in the price 
level increases the quantity of goods and services demanded: 
	 1.	 Consumers are wealthier, which stimulates the demand for consumption goods. 
	 2.	 Interest rates fall, which stimulates the demand for investment goods. 
	 3.	 The currency depreciates, which stimulates the demand for net exports.

The same three effects work in reverse: When the price level rises, decreased 
wealth depresses consumer spending, higher interest rates depress investment 
spending, and a currency appreciation depresses net exports.
Here is a thought experiment to hone your intuition about these effects. 
Imagine that one day you wake up and notice that, for some mysterious reason, 
the prices of all goods and services have fallen by half, so the dollars you are hold-
ing are worth twice as much. In real terms, you now have twice as much money 
as you had when you went to bed the night before. What would you do with the 
extra money? You could spend it at your favorite restaurant, increasing consumer 
spending. You could lend it out (by buying a bond or depositing it in your bank), 
reducing interest rates and increasing investment spending. Or you could invest 
it overseas (by buying shares in an international mutual fund), reducing the real 
exchange value of the dollar and increasing net exports. Whichever of these three 
responses you choose, the fall in the price level leads to an increase in the quan-
tity of goods and services demanded. This is what the downward slope of the 
aggregate-demand curve represents.
It is important to keep in mind that the aggregate-demand curve (like all 
demand curves) is drawn holding “other things equal.” In particular, our three 
explanations of the downward-sloping aggregate-demand curve assume that 
the money supply is fixed. That is, we have been considering how a change in 
the price level affects the demand for goods and services, holding the amount 
of money in the economy constant. As we will see, a change in the quantity of 
money shifts the aggregate-demand curve. At this point, just keep in mind that 
the aggregate-demand curve is drawn for a given quantity of the money supply.
Why the Aggregate-Demand Curve Might Shift
The downward slope of the aggregate-demand curve shows that a fall in the price 
level raises the overall quantity of goods and services demanded. Many other fac-
tors, however, affect the quantity of goods and services demanded at a given price 
level. When one of these other factors changes, the quantity of goods and services 
demanded at every price level changes, and the aggregate-demand curve shifts.
Let’s consider some examples of events that shift aggregate demand. We can cat-
egorize them according to which component of spending is most directly affected.
Shifts Arising from Changes in Consumption  Suppose Americans sud-
denly become more concerned about saving for retirement and, as a result, 
reduce their current consumption. Because the quantity of goods and services 
demanded at any price level is lower, the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the 
left. Conversely, imagine that a stock-market boom makes people wealthier and 
less concerned about saving. The resulting increase in consumer spending means 
a greater quantity of goods and services demanded at any given price level, so the 
aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right.
Thus, any event that changes how much people want to consume at a given 
price level shifts the aggregate-demand curve. One policy variable that has this 
effect is the level of taxation. When the government cuts taxes, it encourages peo-
ple to spend more, so the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right. When the 
government raises taxes, people cut back on their spending, and the aggregate-
demand curve shifts to the left.
Shifts Arising from Changes in Investment  Any event that changes how 
much firms want to invest at a given price level also shifts the aggregate-demand 
curve. For instance, imagine that the computer industry introduces a faster line of

computers, and many firms decide to invest in new computer systems. Because 
the quantity of goods and services demanded at any price level is higher, the 
aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right. Conversely, if firms become pessimis-
tic about future business conditions, they may cut back on investment spending, 
shifting the aggregate-demand curve to the left.
Tax policy can also influence aggregate demand through investment. For 
example, an investment tax credit (a tax rebate tied to a firm’s investment spend-
ing) increases the quantity of investment goods that firms demand at any given 
interest rate and therefore shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right. The 
repeal of an investment tax credit reduces investment and shifts the aggregate-
demand curve to the left. 
Another policy variable that can influence investment and aggregate demand is 
the money supply. As we discuss more fully in the next chapter, an increase in the 
money supply lowers the interest rate in the short run. This decrease in the inter-
est rate makes borrowing less costly, which stimulates investment spending and 
thereby shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right. Conversely, a decrease 
in the money supply raises the interest rate, discourages investment spending, 
and thereby shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left. Many economists 
believe that throughout U.S. history, changes in monetary policy have been an 
important source of shifts in aggregate demand.
Shifts Arising from Changes in Government Purchases  The most direct 
way that policymakers shift the aggregate-demand curve is through government 
purchases. For example, suppose Congress decides to reduce purchases of new 
weapons systems. Because the quantity of goods and services demanded at any 
price level is lower, the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the left. Conversely, if 
state governments start building more highways, the result is a greater quantity of 
goods and services demanded at any price level, so the aggregate-demand curve 
shifts to the right.
Shifts Arising from Changes in Net Exports  Any event that changes net 
exports for a given price level also shifts aggregate demand. For instance, when 
Europe experiences a recession, it buys fewer goods from the United States. This 
reduces U.S. net exports at every price level and shifts the aggregate-demand 
curve for the U.S. economy to the left. When Europe recovers from its recession, it 
starts buying U.S. goods again, and the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right.
Net exports can also change because international speculators cause move-
ments in the exchange rate. Suppose, for instance, that these speculators lose 
confidence in foreign economies and want to move some of their wealth into 
the U.S. economy. In doing so, they bid up the value of the U.S. dollar in the 
foreign exchange market. This appreciation of the dollar makes U.S. goods more 
expensive compared to foreign goods, which depresses net exports and shifts the 
aggregate-demand curve to the left. Conversely, speculation that causes a depre-
ciation of the dollar stimulates net exports and shifts the aggregate-demand curve 
to the right.
Summing Up  In the next chapter, we analyze the aggregate-demand curve in 
more detail. There we examine more precisely how the tools of monetary and fis-
cal policy can shift aggregate demand and whether policymakers should use these 
tools for that purpose. At this point, however, you should have some idea about 
why the aggregate-demand curve slopes downward and what kinds of events 
and policies can shift this curve. Table 1 summarizes what we have learned so far.

QUICK QUIZ  Explain the three reasons the aggregate-demand curve slopes down-
ward • Give an example of an event that would shift the aggregate-demand curve. 
Which way would this event shift the curve?
The Aggregate-Supply Curve
The aggregate-supply curve tells us the total quantity of goods and services that firms 
produce and sell at any given price level. Unlike the aggregate-demand curve, which 
is always downward sloping, the aggregate-supply curve shows a relationship that 
depends crucially on the time horizon examined. In the long run, the aggregate-supply 
curve is vertical, whereas in the short run, the aggregate-supply curve is upward sloping. To 
understand short-run economic fluctuations, and how the short-run behavior of the 
economy deviates from its long-run behavior, we need to examine both the long-run 
aggregate-supply curve and the short-run aggregate-supply curve. 
Why the Aggregate-Supply Curve  
Is Vertical in the Long Run
What determines the quantity of goods and services supplied in the long run? 
We implicitly answered this question earlier in the book when we analyzed the 
The Aggregate-Demand  
Curve: Summary
Table 1
Why Does the Aggregate-Demand Curve Slope Downward?
1.	 The Wealth Effect: A lower price level increases real wealth, which stimulates spending on 
consumption.
2.	 The Interest-Rate Effect: A lower price level reduces the interest rate, which stimulates spending 
on investment. 
3.	 The Exchange-Rate Effect: A lower price level causes the real exchange rate to depreciate, 
which stimulates spending on net exports.
Why Might the Aggregate-Demand Curve Shift?
1.	 Shifts Arising from Changes in Consumption: An event that makes consumers spend more at 
a given price level (a tax cut, a stock-market boom) shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the 
right. An event that makes consumers spend less at a given price level (a tax hike, a stock-
market decline) shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.
2.	 Shifts Arising from Changes in Investment: An event that makes firms invest more at a given price 
level (optimism about the future, a fall in interest rates due to an increase in the money supply) 
shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right. An event that makes firms invest less at a given 
price level (pessimism about the future, a rise in interest rates due to a decrease in the money 
supply) shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left. 
3.	 Shifts Arising from Changes in Government Purchases: An increase in government purchases of goods 
and services (greater spending on defense or highway construction) shifts the aggregate-demand curve 
to the right. A decrease in government purchases on goods and services (a cutback in defense or high-
way spending) shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.
4.	 Shifts Arising from Changes in Net Exports: An event that raises spending on net exports at a 
given price level (a boom overseas, speculation that causes an exchange-rate depreciation) shifts 
the aggregate-demand curve to the right. An event that reduces spending on net exports at a 
given price level (a recession overseas, speculation that causes an exchange-rate appreciation) 
shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.

process of economic growth. In the long run, an economy’s production of goods and 
services (its real GDP) depends on its supplies of labor, capital, and natural resources and 
on the available technology used to turn these factors of production into goods and services. 
When we analyzed these forces that govern long-run growth, we did not need 
to make any reference to the overall level of prices. We examined the price level 
in a separate chapter, where we saw that it was determined by the quantity of 
money. We learned that if two economies were identical except that one had twice 
as much money in circulation as the other, the price level would be twice as high 
in the economy with more money. But since the amount of money does not affect 
technology or the supplies of labor, capital, and natural resources, the output of 
goods and services in the two economies would be the same.
Because the price level does not affect the long-run determinants of real GDP, 
the long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical, as in Figure 4. In other words, 
in the long run, the economy’s labor, capital, natural resources, and technology 
determine the total quantity of goods and services supplied, and this quantity 
supplied is the same regardless of what the price level happens to be.
The vertical long-run aggregate-supply curve is a graphical representation of the 
classical dichotomy and monetary neutrality. As we have already discussed, clas-
sical macroeconomic theory is based on the assumption that real variables do not 
depend on nominal variables. The long-run aggregate-supply curve is consistent 
with this idea because it implies that the quantity of output (a real variable) does 
not depend on the level of prices (a nominal variable). As noted earlier, most econo-
mists believe this principle works well when studying the economy over a period 
of many years but not when studying year-to-year changes. Thus, the aggregate-
supply curve is vertical only in the long run.
Why the Long-Run Aggregate-Supply  
Curve Might Shift
Because classical macroeconomic theory predicts the quantity of goods and ser-
vices produced by an economy in the long run, it also explains the position of the 
Figure 4
The Long-Run  
Aggregate-Supply Curve
In the long run, the quantity 
of output supplied depends 
on the economy’s quantities 
of labor, capital, and natural 
resources and on the technology 
for turning these inputs into 
output. Because the quantity 
supplied does not depend on the 
overall price level, the long-run 
aggregate-supply curve is vertical 
at the natural rate of output.

long-run aggregate-supply curve. The long-run level of production is sometimes 
called potential output or full-employment output. To be more precise, we call it the 
natural rate of output because it shows what the economy produces when unem-
ployment is at its natural, or normal, rate. The natural rate of output is the level of 
production toward which the economy gravitates in the long run.
Any change in the economy that alters the natural rate of output shifts the long-
run aggregate-supply curve. Because output in the classical model depends on 
labor, capital, natural resources, and technological knowledge, we can categorize 
shifts in the long-run aggregate-supply curve as arising from these four sources. 
Shifts Arising from Changes in Labor  Imagine that an economy experi-
ences an increase in immigration. Because there would be a greater number of 
workers, the quantity of goods and services supplied would increase. As a result, 
the long-run aggregate-supply curve would shift to the right. Conversely, if many 
workers left the economy to go abroad, the long-run aggregate-supply curve 
would shift to the left.
The position of the long-run aggregate-supply curve also depends on the natu-
ral rate of unemployment, so any change in the natural rate of unemployment 
shifts the long-run aggregate-supply curve. For example, if Congress were to raise 
the minimum wage substantially, the natural rate of unemployment would rise, 
and the economy would produce a smaller quantity of goods and services. As a 
result, the long-run aggregate-supply curve would shift to the left. Conversely, if 
a reform of the unemployment insurance system were to encourage unemployed 
workers to search harder for new jobs, the natural rate of unemployment would 
fall, and the long-run aggregate-supply curve would shift to the right.
Shifts Arising from Changes in Capital  An increase in the economy’s capi-
tal stock increases productivity and, thereby, the quantity of goods and services 
supplied. As a result, the long-run aggregate-supply curve shifts to the right. 
Conversely, a decrease in the economy’s capital stock decreases productivity 
and the quantity of goods and services supplied, shifting the long-run aggregate-
supply curve to the left. 
Notice that the same logic applies regardless of whether we are discussing 
physical capital such as machines and factories or human capital such as college 
degrees. An increase in either type of capital will raise the economy’s ability to 
produce goods and services and, thus, shift the long-run aggregate-supply curve 
to the right. 
Shifts Arising from Changes in Natural Resources  An economy’s produc-
tion depends on its natural resources, including its land, minerals, and weather. 
The discovery of a new mineral deposit shifts the long-run aggregate-supply curve 
to the right. A change in weather patterns that makes farming more difficult shifts 
the long-run aggregate-supply curve to the left.
In many countries, important natural resources are imported. A change in the 
availability of these resources can also shift the aggregate-supply curve. As we 
discuss later in this chapter, events occurring in the world oil market have histori-
cally been an important source of shifts in aggregate supply for the United States 
and other oil-importing nations.
Shifts Arising from Changes in Technological Knowledge  Perhaps the 
most important reason that the economy today produces more than it did a generation 
ago is that our technological knowledge has advanced. The invention of the computer, 
for instance, has allowed us to produce more goods and services from any given 
natural rate of 
output
the production of 
goods and services that 
an economy achieves 
in the long run when 
unemployment is at its 
normal rate

amounts of labor, capital, and natural resources. As computer use has spread through-
out the economy, it has shifted the long-run aggregate-supply curve to the right.
Although not literally technological, many other events act like changes in 
technology. For instance, opening up international trade has effects similar to 
inventing new production processes because it allows a country to specialize in 
higher-productivity industries; therefore, it also shifts the long-run aggregate-
supply curve to the right. Conversely, if the government passes new regulations 
preventing firms from using some production methods, perhaps to address 
worker safety or environmental concerns, the result would be a leftward shift in 
the long-run aggregate-supply curve.
Summing Up  Because the long-run aggregate-supply curve reflects the classi-
cal model of the economy we developed in previous chapters, it provides a new 
way to describe our earlier analysis. Any policy or event that raised real GDP in 
previous chapters can now be described as increasing the quantity of goods and 
services supplied and shifting the long-run aggregate-supply curve to the right. 
Any policy or event that lowered real GDP in previous chapters can now be 
described as decreasing the quantity of goods and services supplied and shifting 
the long-run aggregate-supply curve to the left. 
Using Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply to 
Depict Long-Run Growth and Inflation
Having introduced the economy’s aggregate-demand curve and the long-run 
aggregate-supply curve, we now have a new way to describe the economy’s long-
run trends. Figure 5 illustrates the changes that occur in an economy from decade 
to decade. Notice that both curves are shifting. Although many forces influence the 
economy in the long run and can in theory cause such shifts, the two most impor-
tant forces in practice are technology and monetary policy. Technological progress 
enhances an economy’s ability to produce goods and services, and the resulting 
increases in output are reflected in continual shifts of the long-run aggregate-supply 
curve to the right. At the same time, because the Fed increases the money supply 
over time, the aggregate-demand curve also shifts to the right. As the figure illus-
trates, the result is continuing growth in output (as shown by increasing Y) and con-
tinuing inflation (as shown by increasing P). This is just another way of representing 
the classical analysis of growth and inflation we conducted in earlier chapters.
The purpose of developing the model of aggregate demand and aggregate sup-
ply, however, is not to dress our previous long-run conclusions in new clothing. 
Instead, it is to provide a framework for short-run analysis, as we will see in a 
moment. As we develop the short-run model, we keep the analysis simple by not 
showing the continuing growth and inflation depicted by the shifts in Figure 5. But 
always remember that long-run trends are the background upon which short-run 
fluctuations are superimposed. Short-run fluctuations in output and the price level should 
be viewed as deviations from the continuing long-run trends of output growth and inflation.
Why the Aggregate-Supply Curve Slopes  
Upward in the Short Run
The key difference between the economy in the short run and in the long run is 
the behavior of aggregate supply. The long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical 
because, in the long run, the overall level of prices does not affect the economy’s 
ability to produce goods and services. By contrast, in the short run, the price

level does affect the economy’s output. That is, over a period of a year or two, an 
increase in the overall level of prices in the economy tends to raise the quantity of 
goods and services supplied, and a decrease in the level of prices tends to reduce 
the quantity of goods and services supplied. As a result, the short-run aggregate-
supply curve is upward sloping, as shown in Figure 6. 
Why do changes in the price level affect output in the short run? Macro­
economists have proposed three theories for the upward slope of the short-run 
aggregate-supply curve. In each theory, a specific market imperfection causes the 
supply side of the economy to behave differently in the short run than it does in 
the long run. The following theories differ in their details, but they share a com-
mon theme: The quantity of output supplied deviates from its long-run, or natural, level 
when the actual price level in the economy deviates from the price level that people expected 
to prevail. When the price level rises above the level that people expected, output 
rises above its natural rate, and when the price level falls below the expected level, 
output falls below its natural rate.
As the economy becomes better able to produce goods and services over time, 
primarily because of technological progress, the long-run aggregate-supply curve 
shifts to the right. At the same time, as the Fed increases the money supply, the 
aggregate-demand curve also shifts to the right. In this figure, output grows 
from Y1990 to Y2000 and then to Y2010, and the price level rises from P1990 to P2000 and 
then to P2010. Thus, the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply offers 
a new way to describe the classical analysis of growth and inflation.

The Sticky-Wage Theory  The first explanation of the upward slope of the 
short-run aggregate-supply curve is the sticky-wage theory. This theory is the 
simplest of the three approaches to aggregate supply, and some economists 
believe it highlights the most important reason why the economy in the short run 
differs from the economy in the long run. Therefore, it is the theory of short-run 
aggregate supply that we emphasize in this book. 
According to this theory, the short-run aggregate-supply curve slopes upward 
because nominal wages are slow to adjust to changing economic conditions. In 
other words, wages are “sticky” in the short run. To some extent, the slow adjust-
ment of nominal wages is attributable to long-term contracts between workers 
and firms that fix nominal wages, sometimes for as long as three years. In addi-
tion, this prolonged adjustment may be attributable to slowly changing social 
norms and notions of fairness that influence wage setting. 
An example helps explain how sticky nominal wages can result in a short-run 
aggregate-supply curve that slopes upward. Imagine that a year ago a firm expected 
the price level today to be 100, and based on this expectation, it signed a contract 
with its workers agreeing to pay them, say, $20 an hour. In fact, the price level, P, 
turns out to be only 95. Because prices have fallen below expectations, the firm gets 
5 percent less than expected for each unit of its product that it sells. The cost of labor 
used to make the output, however, is stuck at $20 per hour. Production is now less 
profitable, so the firm hires fewer workers and reduces the quantity of output sup-
plied. Over time, the labor contract will expire, and the firm can renegotiate with its 
workers for a lower wage (which they may accept because prices are lower), but in 
the meantime, employment and production will remain below their long-run levels.
The same logic works in reverse. Suppose the price level turns out to be 105, 
and the wage remains stuck at $20. The firm sees that the amount it is paid for 
each unit sold is up by 5 percent, while its labor costs are not. In response, it 
hires more workers and increases the quantity supplied. Eventually, the workers 
will demand higher nominal wages to compensate for the higher price level, but 
for a while, the firm can take advantage of the profit opportunity by increasing 
employment and the quantity of output supplied above their long-run levels.
Figure 6
The Short-Run  
Aggregate-Supply  
Curve
In the short run, a fall in the 
price level from P1 to P2 reduces 
the quantity of output supplied 
from Y1 to Y2. This positive 
relationship could be due to 
sticky wages, sticky prices, or 
misperceptions. Over time, 
wages, prices, and perceptions 
adjust, so this positive 
relationship is only temporary.

In short, according to the sticky-wage theory, the short-run aggregate-supply 
curve is upward sloping because nominal wages are based on expected prices 
and do not respond immediately when the actual price level turns out to be dif-
ferent from what was expected. This stickiness of wages gives firms an incentive 
to produce less output when the price level turns out lower than expected and to 
produce more when the price level turns out higher than expected. 
The Sticky-Price Theory  Some economists have advocated another approach 
to explaining the upward slope of the short-run aggregate-supply curve, called 
the sticky-price theory. As we just discussed, the sticky-wage theory emphasizes 
that nominal wages adjust slowly over time. The sticky-price theory emphasizes 
that the prices of some goods and services also adjust sluggishly in response to 
changing economic conditions. This slow adjustment of prices occurs in part 
because there are costs to adjusting prices, called menu costs. These menu costs 
include the cost of printing and distributing catalogs and the time required to 
change price tags. As a result of these costs, prices as well as wages may be sticky 
in the short run.
To see how sticky prices explain the aggregate-supply curve’s upward slope, 
suppose that each firm in the economy announces its prices in advance based 
on the economic conditions it expects to prevail over the coming year. Suppose 
further that after prices are announced, the economy experiences an unexpected 
contraction in the money supply, which (as we have learned) will reduce the 
overall price level in the long run. Although some firms can reduce their prices 
immediately in response to an unexpected change in economic conditions, other 
firms may not want to incur additional menu costs. As a result, they may tempo-
rarily lag behind in reducing their prices. Because these lagging firms have prices 
that are too high, their sales decline. Declining sales, in turn, cause these firms to 
cut back on production and employment. In other words, because not all prices 
adjust instantly to changing economic conditions, an unexpected fall in the price 
level leaves some firms with higher-than-desired prices, and these higher-than-
desired prices depress sales and induce firms to reduce the quantity of goods and 
services they produce. 
The same reasoning applies when the money supply and price level turn out 
to be above what firms expected when they originally set their prices. While some 
firms raise their prices immediately in response to the new economic environ-
ment, other firms lag behind, keeping their prices at the lower-than-desired levels. 
These low prices attract customers, which induces these firms to increase employ-
ment and production. Thus, during the time these lagging firms are operating 
with outdated prices, there is a positive association between the overall price level 
and the quantity of output. This positive association is represented by the upward 
slope of the short-run aggregate-supply curve.
The Misperceptions Theory  A third approach to explaining the upward 
slope of the short-run aggregate-supply curve is the misperceptions theory. 
According to this theory, changes in the overall price level can temporarily mis-
lead suppliers about what is happening in the individual markets in which they 
sell their output. As a result of these short-run misperceptions, suppliers respond 
to changes in the level of prices, and this response leads to an upward-sloping 
aggregate-supply curve.
To see how this might work, suppose the overall price level falls below the 
level that suppliers expected. When suppliers see the prices of their products fall, 
they may mistakenly believe that their relative prices have fallen; that is, they may

believe that their prices have fallen compared to other prices in the economy. For 
example, wheat farmers may notice a fall in the price of wheat before they notice 
a fall in the prices of the many items they buy as consumers. They may infer from 
this observation that the reward to producing wheat is temporarily low, and they 
may respond by reducing the quantity of wheat they supply. Similarly, workers 
may notice a fall in their nominal wages before they notice that the prices of the 
goods they buy are also falling. They may infer that the reward for working is 
temporarily low and respond by reducing the quantity of labor they supply. In 
both cases, a lower price level causes misperceptions about relative prices, and 
these misperceptions induce suppliers to respond to the lower price level by 
decreasing the quantity of goods and services supplied. 
Similar misperceptions arise when the price level is above what was expected. 
Suppliers of goods and services may notice the price of their output rising and 
infer, mistakenly, that their relative prices are rising. They would conclude that it 
is a good time to produce. Until their misperceptions are corrected, they respond 
to the higher price level by increasing the quantity of goods and services supplied. 
This behavior results in a short-run aggregate-supply curve that slopes upward.
Summing Up  There are three alternative explanations for the upward slope 
of the short-run aggregate-supply curve: (1) sticky wages, (2) sticky prices, and 
(3) misperceptions about relative prices. Economists debate which of these theo-
ries is correct, and it is very possible each contains an element of truth. For our 
purposes in this book, the similarities of the theories are more important than the 
differences. All three theories suggest that output deviates in the short run from 
its long-run level (the natural rate) when the actual price level deviates from the 
price level that people had expected to prevail. We can express this mathemati-
cally as follows:

where a is a number that determines how much output responds to unexpected 
changes in the price level.
Notice that each of the three theories of short-run aggregate supply emphasizes a 
problem that is likely to be temporary. Whether the upward slope of the aggregate-
supply curve is attributable to sticky wages, sticky prices, or misperceptions, 
these conditions will not persist forever. Over time, nominal wages will become 
unstuck, prices will become unstuck, and misperceptions about relative prices 
will be corrected. In the long run, it is reasonable to assume that wages and prices 
are flexible rather than sticky and that people are not confused about relative 
prices. Thus, while we have several good theories to explain why the short-run 
aggregate-supply curve is upward sloping, they are all consistent with a long-run 
aggregate-supply curve that is vertical.
Why the Short-Run Aggregate-Supply  
Curve Might Shift
The short-run aggregate-supply curve tells us the quantity of goods and services 
supplied in the short run for any given level of prices. This curve is similar to the long-
run aggregate-supply curve, but it is upward sloping rather than vertical because of 
sticky wages, sticky prices, and misperceptions. Thus, when thinking about what 
shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve, we have to consider all those variables

that shift the long-run aggregate-supply curve plus a new variable—the expected 
price level—that influences the wages that are stuck, the prices that are stuck, and the 
perceptions about relative prices that may be flawed.
Let’s start with what we know about the long-run aggregate-supply curve. As 
we discussed earlier, shifts in the long-run aggregate-supply curve normally arise 
from changes in labor, capital, natural resources, or technological knowledge. 
These same variables shift the short-run aggregate-supply curve. For example, 
when an increase in the economy’s capital stock increases productivity, the 
economy is able to produce more output, so both the long-run and short-run 
aggregate-supply curves shift to the right. When an increase in the minimum 
wage raises the natural rate of unemployment, the economy has fewer employed 
workers and thus produces less output, so both the long-run and short-run 
aggregate-supply curves shift to the left.
The important new variable that affects the position of the short-run aggregate-
supply curve is the price level that people expected to prevail. As we have dis-
cussed, the quantity of goods and services supplied depends, in the short run, 
on sticky wages, sticky prices, and misperceptions. Yet wages, prices, and per-
ceptions are set based on the expected price level. So when people change their 
expectations of the price level, the short-run aggregate-supply curve shifts.
To make this idea more concrete, let’s consider a specific theory of aggregate 
supply—the sticky-wage theory. According to this theory, when workers and firms 
expect the price level to be high, they are more likely to reach a bargain with a high 
level of nominal wages. High wages raise firms’ costs, and for any given actual 
price level, higher costs reduce the quantity of goods and services supplied. Thus, 
when the expected price level rises, wages are higher, costs increase, and firms 
produce a smaller quantity of goods and services at any given actual price level. 
Thus, the short-run aggregate-supply curve shifts to the left. Conversely, when the 
expected price level falls, wages are lower, costs decline, firms increase output at 
any given price level, and the short-run aggregate-supply curve shifts to the right.
A similar logic applies in each theory of aggregate supply. The general lesson 
is the following: An increase in the expected price level reduces the quantity of goods and 
services supplied and shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the left. A decrease in 
the expected price level raises the quantity of goods and services supplied and shifts the short-
run aggregate-supply curve to the right. As we will see in the next section, the influ-
ence of expectations on the position of the short-run aggregate-supply curve plays a 
key role in explaining how the economy makes the transition from the short run to 
the long run. In the short run, expectations are fixed, and the economy finds itself at 
the intersection of the aggregate-demand curve and the short-run aggregate-supply 
curve. In the long run, if people observe that the price level is different from what 
they expected, their expectations adjust, and the short-run aggregate-supply curve 
shifts. This shift ensures that the economy eventually finds itself at the intersection 
of the aggregate-demand curve and the long-run aggregate-supply curve.
You should now have some understanding about why the short-run aggregate-
supply curve slopes upward and what events and policies can cause this curve to 
shift. Table 2 summarizes our discussion.

Two Causes of Economic Fluctuations
Now that we have introduced the model of aggregate demand and aggregate sup-
ply, we have the basic tools we need to analyze fluctuations in economic activity. 
In particular, we can use what we have learned about aggregate demand and 
aggregate supply to examine the two basic causes of short-run fluctuations: shifts 
in aggregate demand and shifts in aggregate supply.
To keep things simple, we assume the economy begins in long-run equilibrium, 
as shown in Figure 7. Output and the price level are determined in the long run 
by the intersection of the aggregate-demand curve and the long-run aggregate-
supply curve, shown as point A in the figure. At this point, output is at its natural 
rate. Because the economy is always in a short-run equilibrium, the short-run 
aggregate-supply curve passes through this point as well, indicating that the 
expected price level has adjusted to this long-run equilibrium. That is, when an 
economy is in its long-run equilibrium, the expected price level must equal the 
actual price level so that the intersection of aggregate demand with short-run 
aggregate supply is the same as the intersection of aggregate demand with long-
run aggregate supply.
The Effects of a Shift in Aggregate Demand
Suppose that a wave of pessimism suddenly overtakes the economy. The cause 
might be a scandal in the White House, a crash in the stock market, or the outbreak 
The Short-Run 
Aggregate-Supply 
Curve: Summary
Table 2
Why Does the Short-Run Aggregate-Supply Curve Slope Upward?
1.	 The Sticky-Wage Theory: An unexpectedly low price level raises the real wage, which causes 
firms to hire fewer workers and produce a smaller quantity of goods and services. 
2.	 The Sticky-Price Theory: An unexpectedly low price level leaves some firms with higher-
than-desired prices, which depresses their sales and leads them to cut back production.
3.	 The Misperceptions Theory: An unexpectedly low price level leads some suppliers to think their 
relative prices have fallen, which induces a fall in production.
Why Might the Short-Run Aggregate-Supply Curve Shift?
1.	 Shifts Arising from Changes in Labor: An increase in the quantity of labor available (perhaps due to 
a fall in the natural rate of unemployment) shifts the aggregate-supply curve to the right. A decrease 
in the quantity of labor available (perhaps due to a rise in the natural rate of unemployment) shifts 
the aggregate-supply curve to the left.
2.	 Shifts Arising from Changes in Capital: An increase in physical or human capital shifts the 
aggregate-supply curve to the right. A decrease in physical or human capital shifts the aggregate-
supply curve to the left.
3.	 Shifts Arising from Changes in Natural Resources: An increase in the availability of natural 
resources shifts the aggregate-supply curve to the right. A decrease in the availability of natural 
resources shifts the aggregate-supply curve to the left. 
4.	 Shifts Arising from Changes in Technology: An advance in technological knowledge shifts the 
aggregate-supply curve to the right. A decrease in the available technology (perhaps due to  
government regulation) shifts the aggregate-supply curve to the left.
5.	 Shifts Arising from Changes in the Expected Price Level: A decrease in the expected price level 
shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the right. An increase in the expected price level 
shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the left.

of war overseas. Because of this event, many people lose confidence in the future 
and alter their plans. Households cut back on their spending and delay major 
purchases, and firms put off buying new equipment. 
What is the macroeconomic impact of such a wave of pessimism? In answering 
this question, we can follow the three steps we used in Chapter 4 when analyzing 
supply and demand in specific markets. First, we determine whether the event 
affects aggregate demand or aggregate supply. Second, we decide in which direc-
tion the curve shifts. Third, we use the diagram of aggregate demand and aggre-
gate supply to compare the initial and the new equilibrium. The new wrinkle is 
that we need to add a fourth step: We have to keep track of a new short-run equi-
librium, a new long-run equilibrium, and the transition between them. Table 3 
summarizes the four steps to analyzing economic fluctuations.
The first two steps are easy. First, because the wave of pessimism affects spend-
ing plans, it affects the aggregate-demand curve. Second, because households 
and firms now want to buy a smaller quantity of goods and services for any 
given price level, the event reduces aggregate demand. As Figure 8 shows, the 
aggregate-demand curve shifts to the left from AD1 to AD2.
The Long-Run Equilibrium

The long-run equilibrium of 
the economy is found where 
the aggregate-demand curve 
crosses the long-run aggregate-
supply curve (point A). When the 
economy reaches this long-run 
equilibrium, the expected price 
level will have adjusted to equal 
the actual price level. As a result, 
the short-run aggregate-supply 
curve crosses this point as well.

With this figure, we can perform step three: By comparing the initial and the new 
equilibrium, we can see the effects of the fall in aggregate demand. In the short run, 
the economy moves along the initial short-run aggregate-supply curve, AS1, going 
from point A to point B. As the economy moves between these two points, output 
falls from Y1 to Y2, and the price level falls from P1 to P2. The falling level of output 
indicates that the economy is in a recession. Although not shown in the figure, firms 
respond to lower sales and production by reducing employment. Thus, the pes-
simism that caused the shift in aggregate demand is, to some extent, self-fulfilling: 
Pessimism about the future leads to falling incomes and rising unemployment.
Now comes step four—the transition from the short-run equilibrium to the 
long-run equilibrium. Because of the reduction in aggregate demand, the price 
level initially falls from P1 to P2. The price level is thus below the level that people 
were expecting (P1) before the sudden fall in aggregate demand. People can be 
surprised in the short run, but they will not remain surprised. Over time, expec-
tations catch up with this new reality, and the expected price level falls as well. 
The fall in the expected price level alters wages, prices, and perceptions, which in 
turn influences the position of the short-run aggregate-supply curve. For exam-
ple, according to the sticky-wage theory, once workers and firms come to expect 
a lower level of prices, they start to strike bargains for lower nominal wages; the 
reduction in labor costs encourages firms to hire more workers and expands pro-
duction at any given level of prices. Thus, the fall in the expected price level shifts 
the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the right from AS1 to AS2 in Figure 8. This 
shift allows the economy to approach point C, where the new aggregate-demand 
curve (AD2) crosses the long-run aggregate-supply curve. 
In the new long-run equilibrium, point C, output is back to its natural rate. 
The economy has corrected itself: The decline in output is reversed in the long

run, even without action by policymakers. Although the wave of pessimism has 
reduced aggregate demand, the price level has fallen sufficiently (to P3) to offset 
the shift in the aggregate-demand curve, and people have come to expect this new 
lower price level as well. Thus, in the long run, the shift in aggregate demand is 
reflected fully in the price level and not at all in the level of output. In other words, 
the long-run effect of a shift in aggregate demand is a nominal change (the price 
level is lower) but not a real change (output is the same).
What should policymakers do when faced with a sudden fall in aggregate 
demand? In this analysis, we assumed they did nothing. Another possibility is that, 
as soon as the economy heads into recession (moving from point A to point B), 
policymakers could take action to increase aggregate demand. As we noted earlier, 
an increase in government spending or an increase in the money supply would 
increase the quantity of goods and services demanded at any price and, therefore, 
would shift the aggregate-demand curve to the right. If policymakers act with suf-
ficient speed and precision, they can offset the initial shift in aggregate demand, 
return the aggregate-demand curve to AD1, and bring the economy back to point A. 
If the policy is successful, the painful period of depressed output and employment 
can be reduced in length and severity. The next chapter discusses in more detail the 
ways in which monetary and fiscal policy influence aggregate demand, as well as 
some of the practical difficulties in using these policy instruments. 
To sum up, this story about shifts in aggregate demand has three important lessons:
• 	 In the short run, shifts in aggregate demand cause fluctuations in the economy’s 
output of goods and services.
FYI
 Monetary Neutrality Revisited
A
ccording to classical economic theory, money is neutral. That is, 
changes in the quantity of money affect nominal variables such 
as the price level but not real variables such as output. Earlier in this 
chapter, we noted that most economists accept this conclusion as 
a description of how the economy works in the long run but not in 
the short run. With the model of aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply, we can illustrate this conclusion and explain it more fully.
	
Suppose that the Federal Reserve reduces the quantity of money 
in the economy. What effect does this change have? As we dis-
cussed, the money supply is one determinant of aggregate demand. 
The reduction in the money supply shifts the aggregate-demand 
curve to the left.
	
The analysis looks just like Figure 8. Even though the cause of 
the shift in aggregate demand is different, we would observe the 
same effects on output and the price level. In the short run, both 
output and the price level fall. The economy experiences a recession. 
But over time, the expected price level falls as well. Firms and work-
ers respond to their new expectations by, for instance, agreeing to 
lower nominal wages. As they do so, the short-run aggregate-supply 
curve shifts to the right. Eventually, the economy finds itself back on 
the long-run aggregate-supply curve.
	
Figure 8 shows when money matters for real variables and when 
it does not. In the long run, money is neutral, as represented by the 
movement of the economy from point A to point C. But in the short 
run, a change in the money supply has real effects, as represented 
by the movement of the economy from point A to point B. An old 
saying summarizes the analysis: “Money is a veil, but when the veil 
flutters, real output sputters.”

Two Big Shifts in Aggregate Demand: The Great 
Depression and World War II
At the beginning of this chapter, we established three key facts about economic 
fluctuations by looking at data since 1965. Let’s now take a longer look at U.S. 
economic history. Figure 9 shows data since 1900 on the percentage change in 
real GDP over the previous three years. In an average three-year period, real GDP 
grows about 10 percent—a bit more than 3 percent per year. The business cycle, 
however, causes fluctuations around this average. Two episodes jump out as 
being particularly significant: the large drop in real GDP in the early 1930s and the 
large increase in real GDP in the early 1940s. Both of these events are attributable 
to shifts in aggregate demand.
	
The economic calamity of the early 1930s is called the Great Depression, and 
it is by far the largest economic downturn in U.S. history. Real GDP fell by 27 
percent from 1929 to 1933, and unemployment rose from 3 percent to 25 percent. 
At the same time, the price level fell by 22 percent over these four years. Many 
other countries experienced similar declines in output and prices during this 
period.

Over the course of U.S. economic history, two fluctuations stand out as especially 
large. During the early 1930s, the economy went through the Great Depression, 
when the production of goods and services plummeted. During the early 1940s, 
the United States entered World War II, and the economy experienced rapidly 
rising production. Both of these events are usually explained by large shifts in 
aggregate demand.

Economic historians continue to debate the causes of the Great Depression, but 
most explanations center on a large decline in aggregate demand. What caused 
aggregate demand to contract? Here is where the disagreement arises. 
	
Many economists place primary blame on the decline in the money supply: 
From 1929 to 1933, the money supply fell by 28 percent. As you may recall from 
our discussion of the monetary system, this decline in the money supply was due 
to problems in the banking system. As households withdrew their money from 
financially shaky banks and bankers became more cautious and started holding 
greater reserves, the process of money creation under fractional-reserve bank-
ing went into reverse. The Fed, meanwhile, failed to offset this fall in the money 
multiplier with expansionary open-market operations. As a result, the money 
supply declined. Many economists blame the Fed’s failure to act for the Great 
Depression’s severity.
	
Other economists have suggested alternative reasons for the collapse in aggre-
gate demand. For example, stock prices fell about 90 percent during this period, 
depressing household wealth and thereby consumer spending. In addition, the 
banking problems may have prevented some firms from obtaining the financing 
they wanted for investment projects, and this would have depressed investment 
spending. It is possible that all these forces may have acted together to contract 
aggregate demand during the Great Depression.
	
The second significant episode in Figure 9—the economic boom of the early 
1940s—is easier to explain. The obvious cause of this event was World War II. As 
the United States entered the war overseas, the federal government had to devote 
more resources to the military. Government purchases of goods and services 
increased almost fivefold from 1939 to 1944. This huge expansion in aggregate 
demand almost doubled the economy’s production of goods and services and led 
to a 20 percent increase in the price level (although widespread government price 
controls limited the rise in prices). Unemployment fell from 17 percent in 1939 to 
about 1 percent in 1944—the lowest level in U.S. history. ■
The Recession of 2008–2009
In 2008 and 2009, the U.S. economy experienced a financial crisis and a severe 
downturn in economic activity. In many ways, it was the worst macroeconomic 
event in more than half a century.
	
The story of this downturn begins a few years earlier with a substantial boom 
in the housing market. The boom was, in part, fueled by low interest rates. In 
the aftermath of the recession of 2001, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates 
to historically low levels. Low interest rates helped the economy recover, but by 
making it less expensive to get a mortgage and buy a home, they also contributed 
to a rise in housing prices.
	
In addition to low interest rates, various developments in the mortgage mar-
ket made it easier for subprime borrowers—those borrowers with a higher risk of 
default based on their income and credit history—to get loans to buy homes. 
One development was securitization, the process by which a financial institu-
tion (specifically, a mortgage originator) makes loans and then (with the help 
of an investment bank) bundles them together into financial instruments called 
mortgage-backed securities. These mortgage-backed securities were then sold to 
other institutions (such as banks and insurance companies), which may not have

fully appreciated the risks in these securities. Some economists blame inadequate 
regulation for these high-risk loans. Others blame misguided government policy: 
Some policies encouraged this high-risk lending to make the goal of homeowner-
ship more attainable for low-income families. Together, these many forces drove 
up housing demand and housing prices. From 1995 to 2006, average housing 
prices in the United States more than doubled.
	
The high price of housing, however, proved unsustainable. From 2006 to 2009, 
housing prices nationwide fell about 30 percent. Such price fluctuations should 
not necessarily be a problem in a market economy. After all, price movements 
are how markets equilibrate supply and demand. In this case, however, the price 
But Have We  
Learned Enough?

L
ike most economists, those at the Inter­
national Monetary Fund are lowering their 
growth forecasts. The financial turmoil gripping 
Wall Street will probably spill over onto every 
other street in America. Most likely, current job 
losses are only the tip of an ugly iceberg.
	
But when Olivier Blanchard, the I.M.F.’s 
chief economist, was asked about the possi-
bility of the world sinking into another Great 
Depression, he reassuringly replied that the 
chance was “nearly nil.” He added, “We’ve 
learned a few things in 80 years.”
	
Yes, we have. But have we learned what 
caused the Depression of the 1930s? Most 
important, have we learned enough to avoid 
doing the same thing again?
	
The Depression began, to a large extent, 
as a garden-variety downturn. The 1920s 
were a boom decade, and as it came to a 
close the Federal Reserve tried to rein in 
what might have been called the irrational 
exuberance of the era. 
	
In 1928, the Fed maneuvered to drive up 
interest rates. So interest-sensitive sectors 
like construction slowed.
	
But things took a bad turn after the 
crash of October 1929. Lower stock prices 
made households poorer and discouraged 
consumer spending, which then made up 
three-quarters of the economy. (Today it’s 
about two-thirds.) 
	
According to the economic historian 
Christina D. Romer, a professor at the 
University of California, Berkeley, the great 
volatility of stock prices at the time also 
increased consumers’ feelings of uncer-
tainty, inducing them to put off purchases 
until the uncertainty was resolved. Spending 
on consumer durable goods like autos 
dropped precipitously in 1930. 
	
Next came a series of bank panics. From 
1930 to 1933, more than 9,000 banks were 
shuttered, imposing losses on depositors 
and shareholders of about $2.5 billion. As 
a share of the economy, that would be the 
equivalent of $340 billion today. 
	
The banking panics put downward pres-
sure on economic activity in two ways. First, 
they put fear into the hearts of depositors. 
Many people concluded that cash in their mat-
tresses was wiser than accounts at local banks.
	
As they withdrew their funds, the bank-
ing system’s normal lending and money 
creation went into reverse. The money 
supply collapsed, resulting in a 24 percent 
drop in the consumer price index from 1929 
to 1933. This deflation pushed up the real 
burden of households’ debts.
 Modern Parallels to the Great 
Depression
As the economy sank in recession in 2008, some observers wondered 
whether we might see a downturn similar to the Great Depression. As of 
2010, when this book was going to press, that scenario seemed unlikely. 
But the similarities between the events of 2008 and 2009 and those of 
the 1930s were too troubling to ignore. This article describes how things 
looked in the midst of the recent economic downturn.

decline had two related repercussions that caused a sizable fall in aggregate 
demand.
	
The first repercussion was a substantial rise in mortgage defaults and home 
foreclosures. During the housing boom, many homeowners had bought their 
homes with mostly borrowed money and minimal down payments. When hous-
ing prices declined, these homeowners were underwater (they owed more on their 
mortgages than their homes were worth). Many of these homeowners stopped 
paying their loans. The banks servicing the mortgages responded to these defaults 
by taking the houses away in foreclosure procedures and then selling them off. 
The banks’ goal was to recoup whatever they could from the bad loans. As you 
	
Second, the disappearance of so many 
banks made credit hard to come by. Small 
businesses often rely on established rela-
tionships with local bankers when they 
need loans, either to tide them over in 
tough times or for business expansion. With 
so many of those relationships interrupted 
at the same time, the economy’s ability to 
channel financial resources toward their 
best use was seriously impaired.
	
Together, these forces proved cataclys-
mic. Unemployment, which had been 3 
percent in 1929, rose to 25 percent in 1933. 
Even during the worst recession since then, 
in 1982, the United States economy did not 
experience half that level of unemployment.
	
Policy makers in the 1930s responded 
vigorously as the situation deteriorated. But 
like a doctor facing a patient with a new 
disease and strange symptoms, they often 
acted in ways that, with the benefit of hind-
sight, appeared counterproductive.
	
Probably the most important source 
of recovery after 1933 was monetary 
expansion, eased by President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt’s decision to abandon the gold 
standard and devalue the dollar. From 1933 
to 1937, the money supply rose, stopping 
the deflation. Production in the economy 
grew about 10 percent a year, three times 
its normal rate.
	
Less successful were various market 
interventions. According to a study by 
the economists Harold L. Cole and Lee 
E. Ohanian, both of the University of 
California, Los Angeles, and the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, President 
Roosevelt made things worse when he 
encouraged the formation of cartels through 
the National Industrial Recovery Act of 
1933. Similarly, they argue, the National 
Labor Relations Act of 1935 strengthened 
organized labor but weakened the recovery 
by impeding market forces. 
	
Looking back at these events, it’s hard 
to avoid seeing parallels to the current situ-
ation. Today, as then, uncertainty has con-
sumers spooked. By some measures, stock 
market volatility in recent days has reached 
levels not seen since the 1930s. With vola-
tility spiking, the University of Michigan’s 
survey reading of consumer sentiment has 
been plunging.
	
Deflation across the economy is not a 
problem (yet), but deflation in the housing 
market is the source of many of our pres-
ent difficulties. With so many homeowners 
owing more on their mortgages than their 
houses are worth, default is an unfortu-
nate but often rational choice. Widespread 
foreclosures, however, only perpetuate the 
downward spiral of housing prices, further 
defaults and additional losses at financial 
institutions. 
	
The Fed and the Treasury Department, 
intent on avoiding the early policy inaction 
that let the Depression unfold, have been 
working hard to keep credit flowing. But 
the financial situation they face is, arguably, 
more difficult than that of the 1930s. Then, 
the problem was largely a crisis of confi-
dence and a shortage of liquidity. Today, 
the problem may be more a shortage of 
solvency, which is harder to solve.
	
What’s next? Perhaps the most trou-
bling study of the 1930s economy was 
written in 1988 by the economists Kathryn 
Dominguez, Ray Fair and Matthew Shapiro; 
it was called “Forecasting the Depression: 
Harvard Versus Yale.” (Mr. Fair is an eco-
nomics professor at Yale; Ms. Dominguez 
and Mr. Shapiro are at the University of 
Michigan.)
	
The three researchers show that the 
leading economists at the time, at compet-
ing forecasting services run by Harvard and 
Yale, were caught completely by surprise 
by the severity and length of the Great 
Depression. What’s worse, despite many 
advances in the tools of economic analysis, 
modern economists armed with the data 
from the time would not have forecast 
much better. In other words, even if another 
Depression were around the corner, you 
shouldn’t expect much advance warning 
from the economics profession.
	
Let me be clear: Like Mr. Blanchard at 
the I.M.F., I am not predicting another Great 
Depression. We have indeed learned a lot 
over the last 80 years. But you should take 
that economic forecast, like all others, with 
more than a single grain of salt.

might have expected from your study of supply and demand, the increase in the 
number of homes for sale exacerbated the downward spiral of house prices. As 
house prices fell, spending on the construction of housing also collapsed.
	
A second repercussion was that the various financial institutions that owned 
mortgage-backed securities suffered huge losses. In essence, by borrowing large 
sums to buy high-risk mortgages, these companies had bet that house prices 
would keep rising; when this bet turned bad, they found themselves at or near 
the point of bankruptcy. Because of these large losses, many financial institutions 
did not have funds to loan out, and the ability of the financial system to channel 
resources to those who could best use them was impaired. Even creditworthy 
customers found themselves unable to borrow to finance investment spending.
	
As a result of all these events, the economy experienced a large contractionary 
shift in aggregate demand. Real GDP and employment both fell sharply. Real 
GDP declined by almost 4 percent between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the 
second quarter of 2009. The rate of unemployment rose from 4.4 percent in May 
2007 to 10.1 percent in October 2009. 
	
As the crisis unfolded, the U.S government responded in a variety of ways. 
Three policy actions—all aimed in part at returning aggregate demand to its 
previous level—are most noteworthy. First, the Fed cut its target for the federal 
funds rate from 5.25 percent in September 2007 to about zero in December 2008. 
The Federal Reserve also started buying mortgage-backed securities and other 
private loans in open-market operations. By purchasing these instruments from 
the banking system, the Fed provided banks with additional funds in the hope 
that the banks would makes loans more readily available. 
	
Second, in an even more unusual move in October 2008, Congress appropri-
ated $700 billion for the Treasury to use to rescue the financial system. The goal 
was to stem the financial crisis on Wall Street and make loans easier to obtain. 
Much of these funds were used for equity injections into banks. That is, the 
Treasury put funds into the banking system, which the banks could use to make 
loans; in exchange for these funds, the U.S. government became a part owner of 
these banks, at least temporarily.
	
Finally, when Barack Obama became president in January 2009, his first major 
initiative was a large increase in government spending. After a relatively brief con-
gressional debate over the form of the legislation, the new president signed a $787 
billion stimulus bill on February 17, 2009. This policy move is discussed more fully in 
the next chapter when we consider the impact of fiscal policy on aggregate demand.
	
As this book was going to press, the economy was starting to recover from 
the economic downturn. Real GDP was growing again, and unemployment had 
fallen to 9.5 percent in June 2010. Which, if any, of these many policy moves were 
most important for promoting this economic recovery? That is surely a question 
that macroeconomic historians will debate in the years to come. ■
The Effects of a Shift in Aggregate Supply
Imagine once again an economy in its long-run equilibrium. Now suppose that 
suddenly some firms experience an increase in their costs of production. For 
example, bad weather in farm states might destroy some crops, driving up the 
cost of producing food products. Or a war in the Middle East might interrupt the 
shipping of crude oil, driving up the cost of producing oil products.
To analyze the macroeconomic impact of such an increase in production costs, 
we follow the same four steps as we always do. First, which curve is affected? 
Because production costs affect the firms that supply goods and services, changes

in production costs alter the position of the aggregate-supply curve. Second, in 
which direction does the curve shift? Because higher production costs make sell-
ing goods and services less profitable, firms now supply a smaller quantity of 
output for any given price level. Thus, as Figure 10 shows, the short-run aggre-
gate-supply curve shifts to the left from AS1 to AS2. (Depending on the event, the 
long-run aggregate-supply curve might also shift. To keep things simple, how-
ever, we will assume that it does not.)
The figure allows us to perform step three of comparing the initial and the new 
equilibrium. In the short run, the economy goes from point A to point B, moving 
along the existing aggregate-demand curve. The output of the economy falls from 
Y1 to Y2, and the price level rises from P1 to P2. Because the economy is experienc-
ing both stagnation (falling output) and inflation (rising prices), such an event is 
sometimes called stagflation.
Now consider step four—the transition from the short-run equilibrium to the 
long-run equilibrium. According to the sticky-wage theory, the key issue is how 
stagflation affects nominal wages. Firms and workers may at first respond to the 
higher level of prices by raising their expectations of the price level and setting 
higher nominal wages. In this case, firms’ costs will rise yet again, and the short-
run aggregate-supply curve will shift farther to the left, making the problem 
of stagflation even worse. This phenomenon of higher prices leading to higher 
wages, in turn leading to even higher prices, is sometimes called a wage-price spiral. 
At some point, this spiral of ever-rising wages and prices will slow. The low 
level of output and employment will put downward pressure on workers’ wages 
because workers have less bargaining power when unemployment is high. As 
nominal wages fall, producing goods and services becomes more profitable, and 
the short-run aggregate-supply curve shifts to the right. As it shifts back toward 
AS1, the price level falls, and the quantity of output approaches its natural rate. In 
stagflation

the long run, the economy returns to point A, where the aggregate-demand curve 
crosses the long-run aggregate-supply curve.
This transition back to the initial equilibrium assumes, however, that aggregate 
demand is held constant throughout the process. In the real world, that may not be 
the case. Policymakers who control monetary and fiscal policy might attempt to off-
set some of the effects of the shift in the short-run aggregate-supply curve by shift-
ing the aggregate-demand curve. This possibility is shown in Figure 11. In this case, 
changes in policy shift the aggregate-demand curve to the right from AD1 to AD2—
exactly enough to prevent the shift in aggregate supply from affecting output. The 
economy moves directly from point A to point C. Output remains at its natural rate, 
and the price level rises from P1 to P3. In this case, policymakers are said to accommo-
date the shift in aggregate supply. An accommodative policy accepts a permanently 
higher level of prices to maintain a higher level of output and employment. 
To sum up, this story about shifts in aggregate supply has two important lessons:
• 	 Shifts in aggregate supply can cause stagflation—a combination of recession 
(falling output) and inflation (rising prices). 
• 	 Policymakers who can influence aggregate demand can potentially mitigate 
the adverse impact on output but only at the cost of exacerbating the problem 
of inflation. 
Oil and the Economy
Some of the largest economic fluctuations in the U.S. economy since 1970 have 
originated in the oil fields of the Middle East. Crude oil is a key input into the 
production of many goods and services, and much of the world’s oil comes from 
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and other Middle Eastern countries. When some event

(usually political in origin) reduces the supply of crude oil flowing from this 
region, the price of oil rises around the world. U.S. firms that produce gasoline, 
tires, and many other products experience rising costs, and they find it less prof-
itable to supply their output of goods and services at any given price level. The 
result is a leftward shift in the aggregate-supply curve, which in turn leads to 
stagflation.
	
The first episode of this sort occurred in the mid-1970s. The countries with 
large oil reserves got together as members of OPEC, the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC is a cartel—a group of sellers that attempts 
to thwart competition and reduce production to raise prices. And indeed, oil 
prices rose substantially. From 1973 to 1975, oil approximately doubled in price. 
Oil-importing countries around the world experienced simultaneous inflation 
and recession. The U.S. inflation rate as measured by the CPI exceeded 10 percent 
for the first time in decades. Unemployment rose from 4.9 percent in 1973 to 8.5 
percent in 1975.
	
Almost the same thing happened a few years later. In the late 1970s, the 
OPEC countries again restricted the supply of oil to raise the price. From 
1978 to 1981, the price of oil more than doubled. Once again, the result was 
FYI
 The Origins of the Model of Aggregate 
Demand and Aggregate Supply
N
ow that we have a preliminary understand-
ing of the model of aggregate demand and 
aggregate supply, it is worthwhile to step back from 
it and consider its history. How did this model of 
short-run fluctuations develop? The answer is that 
this model, to a large extent, is a by-product of the 
Great Depression of the 1930s. Economists and 
policymakers at the time were puzzled about what 
had caused this calamity and were uncertain about 
how to deal with it.
	
In 1936, economist John Maynard Keynes 
published a book titled The General Theory of 
Employment, Interest, and Money, which 
attempted to explain short-run economic fluc-
tuations in general and the Great Depression in particular. Keynes’s 
primary message was that recessions and depressions can occur 
because of inadequate aggregate demand for goods and services. 
	
Keynes had long been a critic of classical economic theory—
the theory we examined earlier in the book—because it could 
explain only the long-run effects of policies. A 
few years before offering The General Theory, 
Keynes had written the following about classical 
economics:
The long run is a misleading guide to current 
affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists 
set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in 
tempestuous seasons they can only tell us when 
the storm is long past, the ocean will be flat.
Keynes’s message was aimed at policymakers as 
well as economists. As the world’s economies suf-
fered with high unemployment, Keynes advocated 
policies to increase aggregate demand, including 
government spending on public works. 
	
In the next chapter, we examine in detail how policymakers can 
use the tools of monetary and fiscal policy to influence aggregate 
demand. The analysis in the next chapter, as well as in this one, 
owes much to the legacy of John Maynard Keynes.

stagflation. Inflation, which had subsided somewhat after the first OPEC 
event, again rose above 10 percent per year. But because the Fed was not 
willing to accommodate such a large rise in inflation, a recession was soon to 
follow. Unemployment rose from about 6 percent in 1978 and 1979 to about 
10 percent a few years later.
	
The world market for oil can also be a source of favorable shifts in aggre-
gate supply. In 1986, squabbling broke out among members of OPEC. Member 
countries reneged on their agreements to restrict oil production. In the world 
market for crude oil, prices fell by about half. This fall in oil prices reduced costs 
to U.S. firms, which now found it more profitable to supply goods and services 
at any given price level. As a result, the aggregate-supply curve shifted to the 
right. The U.S. economy experienced the opposite of stagflation: Output grew 
rapidly, unemployment fell, and the inflation rate reached its lowest level in 
many years.
	
In recent years, the world market for oil has not been as important a source of 
economic fluctuations. Part of the reason is that conservation efforts and changes 
in technology have reduced the economy’s dependence on oil. The amount of oil 
used to produce a unit of real GDP has declined about 40 percent since the OPEC 
shocks of the 1970s. As a result, the economic impact of any change in oil prices is 
smaller today than it was in the past. ■

Conclusion
This chapter has achieved two goals. First, we have discussed some of the impor-
tant facts about short-run fluctuations in economic activity. Second, we have 
introduced a basic model to explain those fluctuations, called the model of aggre-
gate demand and aggregate supply. We continue our study of this model in the 
next chapter to understand more fully what causes fluctuations in the economy 
and how policymakers might respond to these fluctuations.

Summary
• All societies experience short-run economic fluc-
tuations around long-run trends. These fluctua­
tions are irregular and largely unpredictable. 
When recessions do occur, real GDP and other 
measures of income, spending, and production 
fall, and unemployment rises.
• Classical economic theory is based on the 
assumption that nominal variables such as 
the money supply and the price level do not 
influence real variables such as output and 
employment. Most economists believe that this 
assumption is accurate in the long run but not in 
the short run. Economists analyze short-run eco-
nomic fluctuations using the model of aggregate 
demand and aggregate supply. According to this 
model, the output of goods and services and the 
overall level of prices adjust to balance aggregate 
demand and aggregate supply.

• The aggregate-demand curve slopes downward 
for three reasons. The first is the wealth effect: A 
lower price level raises the real value of house-
holds’ money holdings, which stimulates con-

effect: A lower price level reduces the quantity 
of money households demand; as households 
try to convert money into interest-bearing assets, 
interest rates fall, which stimulates investment 
spending. The third is the exchange-rate effect: 
As a lower price level reduces interest rates, 
the dollar depreciates in the market for foreign-
currency exchange, which stimulates net exports.
• Any event or policy that raises consumption, 
investment, government purchases, or net exports 
at a given price level increases aggregate demand. 
Any event or policy that reduces consumption, 
investment, government purchases, or net exports 
at a given price level decreases aggregate demand.
• The long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical. 
In the long run, the quantity of goods and ser-
vices supplied depends on the economy’s labor, 
capital, natural resources, and technology but 
not on the overall level of prices. 
• Three theories have been proposed to explain the 
upward slope of the short-run aggregate-supply 
curve. According to the sticky-wage theory, 
an unexpected fall in the price level temporar-
ily raises real wages, which induces firms to 
reduce employment and production. According 
to the sticky-price theory, an unexpected fall 
in the price level leaves some firms with prices 
that are temporarily too high, which reduces 
their sales and causes them to cut back produc-
tion. According to the misperceptions theory, 
an unexpected fall in the price level leads sup-
pliers to mistakenly believe that their relative 
prices have fallen, which induces them to reduce 
production. All three theories imply that output 
deviates from its natural rate when the actual 
price level deviates from the price level that 
people expected.
• Events that alter the economy’s ability to produce 
output, such as changes in labor, capital, natural 
resources, or technology, shift the short-run 
aggregate-supply curve (and may shift the long-
run aggregate-supply curve as well). In addition, 
the position of the short-run aggregate-supply 
curve depends on the expected price level. 
• One possible cause of economic fluctuations is a 
shift in aggregate demand. When the aggregate-
demand curve shifts to the left, for instance, 
output and prices fall in the short run. Over 
time, as a change in the expected price level 
causes wages, prices, and perceptions to adjust, 
the short-run aggregate-supply curve shifts to 
the right. This shift returns the economy to its 
natural rate of output at a new, lower price level.
• A second possible cause of economic fluctuations 
is a shift in aggregate supply. When the short-run 
aggregate-supply curve shifts to the left, the effect 
is falling output and rising prices—a combination 
called stagflation. Over time, as wages, prices, 
and perceptions adjust, the short-run aggregate-
supply curve shifts back to the right, returning 
the price level and output to their original levels.

Problems and Applications
	 1.	 Suppose the economy is in a long-run  
equilibrium.
a.	 Draw a diagram to illustrate the state of 
the economy. Be sure to show aggregate 
demand, short-run aggregate supply, and 
long-run aggregate supply.
b.	Now suppose that a stock-market crash 
causes aggregate demand to fall. Use your 
diagram to show what happens to output 
and the price level in the short run. What 
happens to the unemployment rate? 
c.	 Use the sticky-wage theory of aggregate sup-
ply to explain what will happen to output and 
the price level in the long run (assuming there 
is no change in policy). What role does the 
expected price level play in this adjustment? 
Be sure to illustrate your analysis in a graph.
	 2.	 Explain whether each of the following events 
will increase, decrease, or have no effect on 
long-run aggregate supply.
a.	 The United States experiences a wave of 
immigration.
b.	Congress raises the minimum wage to $10 
per hour.
c.	 Intel invents a new and more powerful com-
puter chip.
d.	A severe hurricane damages factories along 
the East Coast.
	 3.	 Suppose an economy is in long-run equilibrium.
a.	 Use the model of aggregate demand and 
aggregate supply to illustrate the initial equi-
librium (call it point A). Be sure to include 
both short-run and long-run aggregate supply.
b. 	The central bank raises the money supply by 
5 percent. Use your diagram to show what 
happens to output and the price level as the 
economy moves from the initial to the new 
short-run equilibrium (call it point B).
c.	 Now show the new long-run equilibrium 
(call it point C). What causes the economy to 
move from point B to point C?
d.	According to the sticky-wage theory of 
aggregate supply, how do nominal wages at 
point A compare to nominal wages at point 
B? How do nominal wages at point A com-
pare to nominal wages at point C?
e.	 According to the sticky-wage theory of 
aggregate supply, how do real wages at point 
A compare to real wages at point B? How do 
real wages at point A compare to real wages 
at point C?
f.	 Judging by the impact of the money supply 
on nominal and real wages, is this analysis 
consistent with the proposition that money 
has real effects in the short run but is neutral 
in the long run? 
	 4.	 In 1939, with the U.S. economy not yet 
fully recovered from the Great Depression, 
President Roosevelt proclaimed that 
Thanksgiving would fall a week earlier than 
usual so that the shopping period before 
Christmas would be longer. Explain what 
President Roosevelt might have been trying to 
achieve, using the model of aggregate demand 
and aggregate supply.
	 5.	 Explain why the following statements are false.
a.	 “The aggregate-demand curve slopes down-
ward because it is the horizontal sum of the 
demand curves for individual goods.”
b.	“The long-run aggregate-supply curve is 
vertical because economic forces do not affect 
long-run aggregate supply.”

c.	 “If firms adjusted their prices every day, then 
the short-run aggregate-supply curve would 
be horizontal.”
d.	“Whenever the economy enters a recession, 
its long-run aggregate-supply curve shifts to 
the left.”
	 6.	 For each of the three theories for the upward 
slope of the short-run aggregate-supply curve, 
carefully explain the following:
a.	 How the economy recovers from a recession 
and returns to its long-run equilibrium with-
out any policy intervention.
b.	What determines the speed of that recovery.
	 7.	 Suppose the Fed expands the money supply, but 
because the public expects this Fed action, it simul-
taneously raises its expectation of the price level. 
What will happen to output and the price level in 
the short run? Compare this result to the outcome if 
the Fed expanded the money supply but the public 
didn’t change its expectation of the price level.
	 8.	 The economy begins in long-run equilibrium. 
Then one day, the president appoints a new 
chairman of the Federal Reserve. This new 
chairman is well-known for his view that infla-
tion is not a major problem for an economy. 
a.	 How would this news affect the price level 
that people would expect to prevail?
b.	 How would this change in the expected price 
level affect the nominal wage that workers and 
firms agree to in their new labor contracts?
c.	 How would this change in the nominal wage 
affect the profitability of producing goods 
and services at any given price level?
d.	How does this change in profitability affect 
the short-run aggregate-supply curve?
e.	 If aggregate demand is held constant, how 
does this shift in the aggregate-supply curve 
affect the price level and the quantity of out-
put produced?
f.	 Do you think this Fed chairman was a good 
appointment?
	 9.	 Explain whether each of the following events 
shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve, the 
aggregate-demand curve, both, or neither. For 
each event that does shift a curve, draw a dia-
gram to illustrate the effect on the economy.
a.	 Households decide to save a larger share of 
their income.
b.	Florida orange groves suffer a prolonged 
period of below-freezing temperatures.
c.	 Increased job opportunities overseas cause 
many people to leave the country.
	10.	 For each of the following events, explain the 
short-run and long-run effects on output and 
the price level, assuming policymakers take no 
action.
	a. The stock market declines sharply, reducing 
consumers’ wealth.
	b. The federal government increases spending 
on national defense.
	c. A technological improvement raises produc-
tivity.
	d. A recession overseas causes foreigners to buy 
fewer U.S. goods. 
	11.	 Suppose firms become very optimistic about 
future business conditions and invest heavily in 
new capital equipment.
a.	 Draw an aggregate-demand/aggregate- 
supply diagram to show the short-run effect of 
this optimism on the economy. Label the new 
levels of prices and real output. Explain in 
words why the aggregate quantity of output 
supplied changes.
b.	Now use the diagram from part (a) to show 
the new long-run equilibrium of the econ-
omy. (For now, assume there is no change 
in the long-run aggregate-supply curve.) 
Explain in words why the aggregate quan-
tity of output demanded changes between the 
short run and the long run.
c.	 How might the investment boom affect the 
long-run aggregate-supply curve? Explain.
	12.	 In economy A, all workers agree in advance on 
the nominal wages that their employers will 
pay them. In economy B, half of all workers 
have these nominal wage contracts, while the 
other half have indexed employment contracts, 
so their wages rise and fall automatically with 
the price level. According to the sticky-wage 
theory of aggregate supply, which economy 
has a more steeply sloped short-run aggregate-
supply curve? In which economy would a 5 per-
cent increase in the money supply have a larger 
impact on output? In which economy would it 
have a larger impact on the price level? Explain.
