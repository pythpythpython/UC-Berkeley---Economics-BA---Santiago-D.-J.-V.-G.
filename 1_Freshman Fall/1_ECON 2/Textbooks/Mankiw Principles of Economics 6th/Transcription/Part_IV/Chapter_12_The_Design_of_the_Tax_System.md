The Design of the 
    Tax System
A
l “Scarface” Capone, the notorious 1920s gangster and crime boss, was 
never convicted for his many violent crimes. Yet eventually, he did go 
to jail—for tax evasion. He had neglected to heed Ben Franklin’s obser-
vation that “in this world nothing is certain but death and taxes.”
When Franklin made this claim in 1789, the average American paid less than 
5 percent of his income in taxes, and that remained true for the next hundred years. 
Over the course of the 20th century, however, taxes became ever more important 
in the life of the typical U.S. citizen. Today, all taxes taken together—including 
personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, sales taxes, and 
property taxes—use up about a third of the average American’s income. In many 
European countries, the tax bite is even larger.
Taxes are inevitable because we as citizens expect our government to provide 
us with various goods and services. The previous two chapters shed light on one 
of the Ten Principles of Economics from Chapter 1: The government can sometimes 
improve market outcomes. When the government remedies an externality (such

as air pollution), provides a public good (such as national defense), or regulates 
the use of a common resource (such as fish in a public lake), it can raise economic 
well-being. Yet these activities are costly. For the government to perform these 
and its many other functions, it needs to raise revenue through taxation.
We began our study of taxation in earlier chapters, where we saw how a tax on 
a good affects supply and demand for that good. In Chapter 6, we saw that a tax 
reduces the quantity sold in a market, and we examined how the burden of a tax is 
shared by buyers and sellers depending on the elasticities of supply and demand. 
In Chapter 8, we examined how taxes affect economic well-being. We learned that 
taxes cause deadweight losses: The reduction in consumer and producer surplus 
resulting from a tax exceeds the revenue raised by the government.
In this chapter, we build on these lessons to discuss the design of a tax system. 
We begin with a financial overview of the U.S. government. When thinking about 
the tax system, it is useful to know some basic facts about how the U.S. govern-
ment raises and spends money. We then consider the fundamental principles of 
taxation. Most people agree that taxes should impose as small a cost on society as 
possible and that the burden of taxes should be distributed fairly. That is, the tax 
system should be both efficient and equitable. As we will see, however, stating these 
goals is easier than achieving them.

CHAPTER 12    The Design of the Tax System
government has grown substantially over the past century. In 1902, the govern-
ment collected 7 percent of total income; in recent years, government has col-
lected about 30 percent. In other words, as the economy’s income has grown, the 
government’s revenue from taxation has grown even more.
Table 1 compares the tax burden for several major countries, as measured by 
the government’s tax revenue as a percentage of the nation’s total income. The 
United States is in the middle of the pack. The U.S. tax burden is low compared to 
many European countries, but it is high compared to some other nations around 
the world. Less economically developed countries, such as India, often have rela-
tively low tax burdens. This fact is consistent with the evidence in Figure 1 of a 
growing tax burden over time: As a nation gets richer, the government typically 
takes a larger share of income in taxes.
The overall size of government tells only part of the story. Behind the total 
dollar figures lie thousands of individual decisions about taxes and spending. 
To understand the government’s finances more fully, let’s look at how the total 
breaks down into some broad categories.
The Federal Government
The U.S. federal government collects about two-thirds of the taxes in our economy. 
It raises this money in a number of ways, and it finds even more ways to spend it.
Receipts  Table 2 shows the receipts of the federal government in 2009. Total 
receipts that year were $2,105 billion, a number so large that it is hard to compre-
hend. To bring this astronomical number down to earth, we can divide it by the 
size of the U.S. population, which was about 307 million in 2009. We then find that 
the average American paid $6,846 to the federal government.

The Economics of the Public Sector
The largest source of revenue for the federal government is the individual 
income tax. As April 15 approaches each year, almost every American family fills 
out a tax form to determine how much income tax it owes the government. Each 
family is required to report its income from all sources: wages from working, 
interest on savings, dividends from corporations in which it owns shares, profits 
from any small businesses it operates, and so on. The family’s tax liability (how 
much it owes) is then based on its total income. 
A family’s income tax liability is not simply proportional to its income. Instead, 
the law requires a more complicated calculation. Taxable income is computed as 
total income minus an amount based on the number of dependents (primarily chil-
dren) and minus certain expenses that policymakers have deemed “deductible” 
(such as mortgage interest payments, state and local tax payments, and charitable 
giving). Then the tax liability is calculated from taxable income using a schedule 
such as the one shown in Table 3.
This table presents the marginal tax rate—the tax rate applied to each additional 
dollar of income. Because the marginal tax rate rises as income rises, higher-
income families pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes. Note that each 
tax rate in the table applies only to income within the associated range, not to 
a person’s entire income. For example, a person with an income of $1 million 
still pays only 10 percent of the first $8,375. (Later in this chapter we discuss the 
concept of marginal tax rate more fully.)
Almost as important to the federal government as the individual income tax 
are payroll taxes. A payroll tax is a tax on the wages that a firm pays its workers. 
Table 2 calls this revenue social insurance taxes because the revenue from these 
taxes is earmarked to pay for Social Security and Medicare. Social Security is an 
income-support program designed primarily to maintain the living standards of 
the elderly. Medicare is the government health program for the elderly. Table 2 
shows that the average American paid $2,899 in social insurance taxes in 2009.
Next in magnitude, but much smaller than either individual income taxes or 
social insurance taxes, is the corporate income tax. A corporation is a business set 
up to have its own legal existence, distinct and separate from its owners. The 
government taxes each corporation based on its profit—the amount the corpora-
tion receives for the goods or services it sells minus the costs of producing those 
goods or services. Notice that corporate profits are, in essence, taxed twice. They 
are taxed once by the corporate income tax when the corporation earns the profits; 
they are taxed a second time by the individual income tax when the corporation

This table shows the marginal tax rates for an 
unmarried taxpayer. The taxes owed by a taxpayer 
depend on all the marginal tax rates up to his or 
her income level. For example, a taxpayer with 
income of $25,000 pays 10 percent of the first 
$8,375 of income, and then 15 percent of the rest.

uses its profits to pay dividends to its shareholders. In 2003, the tax rate on divi-
dend income was reduced to 15 percent, in part to compensate for this double 
taxation.
The last category, labeled “other” in Table 2, makes up 8 percent of receipts. 
This category includes excise taxes, which are taxes on specific goods like gasoline, 
cigarettes, and alcoholic beverages. It also includes various small items, such as 
estate taxes and customs duties.
Spending  Table 4 shows the spending of the federal government in 2009. Total 
spending was $3,518 billion, or $11,441 per person. This table also shows how the 
federal government’s spending was divided among major categories.
The largest category in Table 4 is Social Security, which represents mostly 
transfer payments to the elderly. A transfer payment is a government payment 
not made in exchange for a good or service. This category made up 19 percent of 
spending by the federal government in 2009.
The second largest category of spending is national defense. This includes both 
the salaries of military personnel and the purchases of military equipment such 
as guns, fighter jets, and warships. Spending on national defense fluctuates over 
time as international tensions and the political climate change. Not surprisingly, 
spending on national defense rises substantially during wars. In part because of 
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, defense spending rose from 17 to 19 percent of 
total federal spending from 2001 to 2009.
The third category in Table 4, spending on income security, includes transfer 
payments to poor families and the unemployed. One program is Temporary 
Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), often simply called “welfare.” Another is 
the Food Stamp program, which gives poor families vouchers that they can use 
to buy food. A third program is unemployment compensation, which provides 
income to people who have recently lost their jobs. The federal government pays 
some of this money to state and local governments, which administer the pro-
grams under federal guidelines. Income security spending tends to rise during 
recessions, when people’s incomes fall and the number of unemployed increases. 
This explains the rise in income security spending from 13 to 15 percent of total 
federal spending between 2006 and 2009. 
Health spending looms large in the federal budget. Medicare, the fourth cate­
gory in Table 4, is the government’s health plan for the elderly. The fifth category

in the table is other health spending, which includes Medicaid, the federal health 
program for the poor, and spending on medical research, such as that conducted 
through the National Institutes of Health. Total health spending makes up about 
a fifth of the federal budget.
Next on the list is net interest. When a person borrows from a bank, the bank 
requires the borrower to pay interest for the loan. The same is true when the 
government borrows from the public. The more indebted the government, the 
larger the amount it must spend in interest payments.
The “other” category in Table 4 consists of many less expensive functions of 
government. It includes, for example, the federal court system, the space program, 
farm-support programs, housing credit programs, as well as the salaries of mem-
bers of Congress and the president.
You might have noticed that total receipts of the federal government shown in 
Table 2 fall short of total spending shown in Table 4 by $1,413 billion. In such a 
situation, the government is said to run a budget deficit. When receipts exceed 
spending, the government is said to run a budget surplus. The government 
finances a budget deficit by borrowing from the public. That is, it sells govern-
ment debt to the private sector, including both investors in the United States and 
those abroad. When the government runs a budget surplus, it uses the excess 
receipts to reduce its outstanding debts.
 The Fiscal Challenge Ahead
In 2009, the federal government ran a budget deficit of $1,413 billion. The magni-
tude of this figure represents an almost eightfold increase over the deficit in 2007. 
The dramatic rise in the budget deficit is due primarily to the deep recession the 
economy was experiencing at the time; recessions tend to increase government 
spending and reduce government revenue. However, this short-term increase 
in the deficit is only the tip of the iceberg: Long-term projections of the govern-
ment’s budget show that, under current law, the government will spend vastly 
more than it will receive in tax revenue in the decades ahead. As a percentage of 
gross domestic product (the total income in the economy), taxes are projected to 
be about constant. But government spending as a percentage of GDP is projected 
to rise gradually but substantially over the next several decades.
	
One reason for the rise in government spending is that Social Security and 
Medicare provide significant benefits for the elderly, who are a growing percent-
age of the overall population. Over the past half century, medical advances and 
lifestyle improvements have greatly increased life expectancy. In 1950, a man age 
65 could expect to live for another 13 years; now he can expect to live another 17 
years. The life expectancy of a 65-year-old woman has risen from 16 years in 1950 
to 20 years today. At the same time, people are having fewer children. In 1950, the 
typical woman had three children. Today, the number is about two. As a result 
of smaller families, the labor force is growing more slowly now than it has in the 
past. 
	
Panel (a) of Figure 2 shows the demographic shift that is arising from the com-
bination of longer life expectancy and lower fertility. In 1950, the elderly popula-
tion equaled about 14 percent of the working-age population. Now the elderly 
are about 21 percent of the working-age population, and that figure will rise to 
about 40 percent over the next 50 years. Turning those numbers on their head, this

CHAPTER 12    The Design of the Tax System
means that in 1950 there were about 7 working-age people for every elderly person, 
whereas in 2050 there will be only 2.5. As a result, there will be fewer workers 
paying taxes to support the government benefits that each elderly person receives. 
	
A second, related trend that will affect government spending in the decades 
ahead is the rising cost of healthcare. The government provides healthcare to 
the elderly through the Medicare system and to the poor through Medicaid. As 
the cost of healthcare increases, government spending on these programs will 
increase as well.
	
Policymakers have proposed various ways to stem the rise in healthcare costs, 
such as reducing the burden of lawsuits on the healthcare system, encouraging 
more competition among healthcare providers, and promoting greater use of 
information technology. In 2010, President Obama signed a healthcare reform 
bill with the goal of both expanding health insurance coverage and reducing the 
growth of healthcare costs. Many health economists, however, believe that such 
measures will have only a limited impact on reducing the government’s health-
care expenditures because the main reason for rising healthcare costs is medi-
cal advances that provide new, better, but often expensive ways to extend and 
improve our lives.
	
Panel (b) of Figure 2 shows government spending on Social Security, Medicare, 
and Medicaid as a percentage of GDP. Spending on these programs has risen from 
less than 1 percent in 1950 to about 10 percent today. The combination of a grow-
ing elderly population and rising healthcare costs is expected to continue and 
even accelerate the trend.

government budget. Panel (b) shows government spending on Social Security, Medicare, 
and Medicaid as a percentage of GDP. The projection for future years assumes no 
change in current law. Unless changes in benefits are enacted, government spending  
on these programs will rise significantly and will require large tax increases to pay  
for them.

 How our society will handle these spending increases is an open question. 
Simply increasing the budget deficit is not feasible. A budget deficit just pushes 
the cost of government spending onto a future generation of taxpayers, who will 
inherit a government with greater debts. In the long run, the government needs 
to pay for what it spends.
	
Some economists believe that to pay for these commitments, we will need to 
raise taxes substantially as a percentage of GDP. If so, the long-term trend we saw 
in Figure 1 will continue. Spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid 
is expected to rise by about 10 percentage points of GDP. Because taxes are now 
30 percent of GDP, paying for these benefits would require approximately a one-
third increase in all taxes.
	
Other economists believe that such high tax rates would impose too great a cost 
on younger workers. They believe that policymakers should reduce the promises 
now being made to the elderly of the future and that, at the same time, people 
should be encouraged to take a greater role caring for themselves as they age. This 
might entail raising the normal retirement age, while giving people more incen-
tive to save during their working years to prepare for their own retirement and 
health costs. 
	
It is likely that the final resolution will involve a combination of measures. 
No one can dispute that resolving this debate is one of the great challenges 
ahead.  ■
State and Local Government
State and local governments collect about 40 percent of all taxes paid. Let’s look 
at how they obtain tax revenue and how they spend it.
Receipts  Table 5 shows the receipts of U.S. state and local governments. Total 
receipts for 2007 were $2,329 billion, or $7,574 per person. The table also shows 
how this total is broken down into different kinds of taxes.
The two most important taxes for state and local governments are sales taxes 
and property taxes. Sales taxes are levied as a percentage of the total amount 
spent at retail stores. Every time a customer buys something, he or she pays the 
storekeeper an extra amount that the storekeeper remits to the government. (Some 
states exclude certain items that are considered necessities, such as food and cloth-
ing.) Property taxes are levied as a percentage of the estimated value of land and

structures and are paid by property owners. Together, these two taxes make up 
more than a third of all receipts of state and local governments.
State and local governments also levy individual and corporate income taxes. 
In many cases, state and local income taxes are similar to federal income taxes. 
In other cases, they are quite different. For example, some states tax income from 
wages less heavily than income earned in the form of interest and dividends. 
Some states do not tax income at all.
State and local governments also receive substantial funds from the federal 
government. To some extent, the federal government’s policy of sharing its 
revenue with state governments redistributes funds from high-income states 
(who pay more taxes) to low-income states (who receive more benefits). Often, 
these funds are tied to specific programs that the federal government wants to 
subsidize.
Finally, state and local governments receive much of their receipts from vari-
ous sources included in the “other” category in Table 5. These include fees for 
fishing and hunting licenses, tolls from roads and bridges, and fares for public 
buses and subways. 
Spending  Table 6 shows the total spending of state and local governments in 
2007 and its breakdown among the major categories.
By far the biggest single expenditure for state and local governments is educa-
tion. Local governments pay for the public schools, which educate most students 
from kindergarten through high school. State governments contribute to the sup-
port of public universities. In 2007, education accounted for about a third of the 
spending of state and local governments.
The second largest category of spending is for public welfare, which includes 
transfer payments to the poor. This category includes some federal programs that 
are administered by state and local governments. The next category is highways, 
which includes the building of new roads and the maintenance of existing ones. 
The large “other” category in Table 6 includes the many additional services pro-
vided by state and local governments, such as libraries, police, garbage removal, 
fire protection, park maintenance, and snow removal.

Now that we have seen how various levels of the U.S. government raise and 
spend money, let’s consider how one might evaluate its tax policy and design a 
tax system. The primary aim of a tax system is to raise revenue for the govern-
ment, but there are many ways to raise any given amount of money. When choos-
ing among the many alternative tax systems, policymakers have two objectives: 
efficiency and equity.
One tax system is more efficient than another if it raises the same amount of 
revenue at a smaller cost to taxpayers. What are the costs of taxes to taxpayers? 
The most obvious cost is the tax payment itself. This transfer of money from the 
taxpayer to the government is an inevitable feature of any tax system. Yet taxes 
also impose two other costs, which well-designed tax policy tries to avoid or, at 
least, minimize:
• 	 The deadweight losses that result when taxes distort the decisions that  
people make; 
• 	 The administrative burdens that taxpayers bear as they comply with the  
tax laws.
An efficient tax system is one that imposes small deadweight losses and small 
administrative burdens.
Deadweight Losses
One of the Ten Principles of Economics is that people respond to incentives, and this 
includes incentives provided by the tax system. If the government taxes ice cream, 
people eat less ice cream and more frozen yogurt. If the government taxes hous-
ing, people live in smaller houses and spend more of their income on other things. 
If the government taxes labor earnings, people work less and enjoy more leisure.
Because taxes distort incentives, they entail deadweight losses. As we first 
discussed in Chapter 8, the deadweight loss of a tax is the reduction in economic 
well-being of taxpayers in excess of the amount of revenue raised by the govern-
ment. The deadweight loss is the inefficiency that a tax creates as people allocate 
resources according to the tax incentive rather than the true costs and benefits of 
the goods and services that they buy and sell.
To recall how taxes cause deadweight losses, consider an example. Suppose 
that Joe places an $8 value on a pizza, and Jane places a $6 value on it. If there is 
no tax on pizza, the price of pizza will reflect the cost of making it. Let’s sup-
pose that the price of pizza is $5, so both Joe and Jane choose to buy one. Both 
con­sumers get some surplus of value over the amount paid. Joe gets consumer 
surplus of $3, and Jane gets consumer surplus of $1. Total surplus is $4.
Now suppose that the government levies a $2 tax on pizza and the price of 
pizza rises to $7. (This occurs if supply is perfectly elastic.) Joe still buys a pizza, 
but now he has consumer surplus of only $1. Jane now decides not to buy a 
pizza because its price is higher than its value to her. The government collects tax 
revenue of $2 on Joe’s pizza. Total consumer surplus has fallen by $3 (from $4 to 
$1). Because total surplus has fallen by more than the tax revenue, the tax has a 
deadweight loss. In this case, the deadweight loss is $1.
Notice that the deadweight loss comes not from Joe, the person who pays the 
tax, but from Jane, the person who doesn’t. The reduction of $2 in Joe’s surplus 
“I was gonna fix the 
place up, but if I did, the 
city would just raise my 
taxes!”

CHAPTER 12    The Design of the Tax System
exactly offsets the amount of revenue the government collects. The deadweight 
loss arises because the tax causes Jane to alter her behavior. When the tax raises 
the price of pizza, Jane is worse off, and yet there is no offsetting revenue to the 
government. This reduction in Jane’s welfare is the deadweight loss of the tax. 
Should Income or Consumption Be Taxed?
When taxes induce people to change their behavior—such as inducing Jane to 
buy less pizza—the taxes cause deadweight losses and make the allocation of 
resources less efficient. As we have already seen, much government revenue 
comes from the individual income tax. In a case study in Chapter 8, we dis-
cussed how this tax discourages people from working as hard as they otherwise 
might. Another inefficiency caused by this tax is that it discourages people from 
saving.
	
Consider a person 25 years old who is considering saving $1,000. If he puts 
this money in a savings account that earns 8 percent and leaves it there, he would 
have $21,720 when he retires at age 65. Yet if the government taxes one-fourth of 
his interest income each year, the effective interest rate is only 6 percent. After 
40 years of earning 6 percent, the $1,000 grows to only $10,290, less than half of 
what it would have been without taxation. Thus, because interest income is taxed, 
saving is much less attractive.
	
Some economists advocate eliminating the current tax system’s disincentive 
toward saving by changing the basis of taxation. Rather than taxing the amount of 
income that people earn, the government could tax the amount that people spend. 
Under this proposal, all income that is saved would not be taxed until the saving 
is later spent. This alternative system, called a consumption tax, would not distort 
people’s saving decisions. 
	
Various provisions of the current tax code already make the tax system a bit 
like a consumption tax. Taxpayers can put a limited amount of their saving into 
special accounts—such as Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k) plans—that 
escape taxation until the money is withdrawn at retirement. For people who do 
most of their saving through these retirement accounts, their tax bill is, in effect, 
based on their consumption rather than their income.
	
European countries tend to rely more on consumption taxes than does the 
United States. Most of them raise a significant amount of government revenue 
through a value-added tax, or a VAT. A VAT is like the retail sales tax that many 
U.S. states use, but rather than collecting all of the tax at the retail level when the 
consumer buys the final good, the government collects the tax in stages as the 
good is being produced (that is, as value is added by firms along the chain of 
production). 
	
Various U.S. policymakers have proposed that the tax code move further in 
the direction of taxing consumption rather than income. In 2005, economist Alan 
Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, offered this advice to a presi-
dential commission on tax reform: “As you know, many economists believe that 
a consumption tax would be best from the perspective of promoting economic 
growth—particularly if one were designing a tax system from scratch—because 
a consumption tax is likely to encourage saving and capital formation. However, 
getting from the current tax system to a consumption tax raises a challenging set 
of transition issues.”  ■

 The Temporarily Disappearing Estate Tax
In an odd twist of legislative history, the U.S. tax on large estates—
bequests people leave their descendents when they die—expired in 
January 2010, but for one year only. That is, the tax would once again 
be in effect as of January 1, 2011. This article, written at the end of 
2009, describes people responding to the peculiar incentives presented 
by the expiration and reinstatement of the estate tax.

Rich Cling to Life to 
Beat Tax Man 
By Laura Saunders 
N
othing’s certain except death and 
taxes—but a temporary lapse in 
the estate tax is causing a few wealthy 
Americans to try to bend those rules.
	
Starting Jan. 1, 2010, the estate tax—
which can erase nearly half of a wealthy 
person’s estate—goes away for a year. 
For families facing end-of-life decisions in 
the immediate future, the change is mak-
ing one of life’s most trying episodes only 
more complex.
	
“I have two clients on life support, and 
the families are struggling with whether to 
continue heroic measures for a few more 
days,” says Joshua Rubenstein, a lawyer 
with Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP in New 
York. “Do they want to live for the rest of 
their lives having made serious medical deci-
sions based on estate-tax law?”
	
Currently, the tax applies to about 5,500 
taxpayers a year. So, on average, at least 15 
people die every day whose estates would 
benefit from the tax’s lapse.
	
The macabre situation stems from 2001, 
when Congress raised estate-tax exemp-
tions, culminating with the tax’s disap-
pearance in 2010. However, due to budget 
constraints, lawmakers didn’t make the 
change permanent. So the estate tax is due 
to come back to life in 2011—at a higher 
rate and lower exemption.
	
To make it easier on their heirs, some 
clients are putting provisions into their health-
care proxies allowing whoever makes end-of-
life medical decisions to consider changes in 
estate-tax law. “We have done this at least 
a dozen times, and have gotten more calls 
recently,” says Andrew Katzenstein, a lawyer 
with Proskauer Rose LLP in Los Angeles.
	
Of course, plenty of taxpayers them-
selves are eager to live to see the new 
year. One wealthy, terminally ill real-estate 
entrepreneur has told his doctors he is 
determined to live until the law changes.
	
“Whenever he wakes up,” says his lawyer, 
“He says: ‘What day is it? Is it Jan. 1 yet?’”. . .
	
The situation is causing at least one 
person to add the prospect of euthanasia 
to his estate-planning mix, according to 
Mr. Katzenstein of Proskauer Rose. An 
elderly, infirm client of his recently asked 
whether undergoing euthanasia during 
2010 in Holland, where it’s legal, might 
allow his estate to dodge the tax.
	
His answer: Yes.

Administrative Burden
If you ask the typical person on April 15 for an opinion about the tax system, you 
might get an earful (perhaps peppered with expletives) about the headache of 
filling out tax forms. The administrative burden of any tax system is part of the 
inefficiency it creates. This burden includes not only the time spent in early April 
filling out forms but also the time spent throughout the year keeping records for 
tax purposes and the resources the government has to use to enforce the tax laws.
Many taxpayers—especially those in higher tax brackets—hire tax lawyers 
and accountants to help them with their taxes. These experts in the complex tax 
laws fill out the tax forms for their clients and help them arrange their affairs in a 
way that reduces the amount of taxes owed. This behavior is legal tax avoidance, 
which is different from illegal tax evasion.

CHAPTER 12    The Design of the Tax System
Critics of our tax system say that these advisers help their clients avoid taxes 
by abusing some of the detailed provisions of the tax code, often dubbed “loop-
holes.” In some cases, loopholes are congressional mistakes: They arise from 
ambiguities or omissions in the tax laws. More often, they arise because Congress 
has chosen to give special treatment to specific types of behavior. For example, 
the U.S. federal tax code gives preferential treatment to investors in municipal 
bonds because Congress wanted to make it easier for state and local governments 
to borrow money. To some extent, this provision benefits states and localities, and 
to some extent, it benefits high-income taxpayers. Most loopholes are well known 
by those in Congress who make tax policy, but what looks like a loophole to one 
taxpayer may look like a justifiable tax deduction to another.
The resources devoted to complying with the tax laws are a type of deadweight 
loss. The government gets only the amount of taxes paid. By contrast, the taxpayer 
loses not only this amount but also the time and money spent documenting, 
computing, and avoiding taxes.
The administrative burden of the tax system could be reduced by simplifying 
the tax laws. Yet simplification is often politically difficult. Most people are ready 
to simplify the tax code by eliminating the loopholes that benefit others, but few 
are eager to give up the loopholes that benefit them. In the end, the complexity of 
the tax law results from the political process as various taxpayers with their own 
special interests lobby for their causes. 
Marginal Tax Rates versus Average Tax Rates
When discussing the efficiency and equity of income taxes, economists distin-
guish between two notions of the tax rate: the average and the marginal. The 
average tax rate is total taxes paid divided by total income. The marginal tax rate 
is the extra taxes paid on an additional dollar of income.
For example, suppose that the government taxes 20 percent of the first $50,000 
of income and 50 percent of all income above $50,000. Under this tax, a person 
who makes $60,000 pays a tax of $15,000: 20 percent of the first $50,000 (0.20 × 
$50,000 = $10,000) plus 50 percent of the next $10,000 (0.50 × $10,000 = $5,000). 
For this person, the average tax rate is $15,000/$60,000, or 25 percent. But the mar-
ginal tax rate is 50 percent. If the taxpayer earned an additional dollar of income, 
that dollar would be subject to the 50 percent tax rate, so the amount the taxpayer 
would owe to the government would rise by $0.50.
The marginal and average tax rates each contain a useful piece of information. 
If we are trying to gauge the sacrifice made by a taxpayer, the average tax rate 
is more appropriate because it measures the fraction of income paid in taxes. By 
contrast, if we are trying to gauge how much the tax system distorts incentives, 
the marginal tax rate is more meaningful. One of the Ten Principles of Economics 
in Chapter 1 is that rational people think at the margin. A corollary to this princi-
ple is that the marginal tax rate measures how much the tax system discourages 
people from working. If you are thinking of working an extra few hours, the 
marginal tax rate determines how much the government takes of your additional 
earnings. It is the marginal tax rate, therefore, that determines the deadweight loss 
of an income tax.
Lump-Sum Taxes
Suppose the government imposes a tax of $4,000 on everyone. That is, everyone 
owes the same amount, regardless of earnings or any actions that a person might 
take. Such a tax is called a lump-sum tax.

The Economics of the Public Sector
A lump-sum tax shows clearly the difference between average and marginal 
tax rates. For a taxpayer with income of $20,000, the average tax rate of a $4,000 
lump-sum tax is 20 percent; for a taxpayer with income of $40,000, the average tax 
rate is 10 percent. For both taxpayers, the marginal tax rate is zero because no tax 
is owed on an additional dollar of income. 
A lump-sum tax is the most efficient tax possible. Because a person’s deci-
sions do not alter the amount owed, the tax does not distort incentives and, 
therefore, does not cause deadweight losses. Because everyone can easily com-
pute the amount owed and because there is no benefit to hiring tax lawyers and 
accountants, the lump-sum tax imposes a minimal administrative burden on 
taxpayers. 
If lump-sum taxes are so efficient, why do we rarely observe them in the real 
world? The reason is that efficiency is only one goal of the tax system. A lump-
sum tax would take the same amount from the poor and the rich, an outcome most 
people would view as unfair. To understand the tax systems that we observe, we 
must therefore consider the other major goal of tax policy: equity. 
Quick Quiz  What is meant by the efficiency of a tax system? • What can make a 
tax system inefficient?
Taxes and Equity
Ever since American colonists dumped imported tea into Boston harbor to protest 
high British taxes, tax policy has generated some of the most heated debates in 
American politics. The heat is rarely fueled by questions of efficiency. Instead, it 
arises from disagreements over how the tax burden should be distributed. Senator 
Russell Long once mimicked the public debate with this ditty:
Don’t tax you. 
Don’t tax me. 
Tax that fella behind the tree.
Of course, if we are to rely on the government to provide some of the goods and 
services we want, taxes must fall on someone. In this section, we consider the 
equity of a tax system. How should the burden of taxes be divided among the 
population? How do we evaluate whether a tax system is fair? Everyone agrees 
that the tax system should be equitable, but there is much disagreement about 
what equity means and how the equity of a tax system can be judged.
The Benefits Principle
One principle of taxation, called the benefits principle, states that people should 
pay taxes based on the benefits they receive from government services. This 
principle tries to make public goods similar to private goods. It seems fair that 
a person who often goes to the movies pays more in total for movie tickets than a 
person who rarely goes. Similarly, a person who gets great benefit from a public 
good should pay more for it than a person who gets little benefit.
The gasoline tax, for instance, is sometimes justified using the benefits princi-
ple. In some states, revenues from the gasoline tax are used to build and main-
tain roads. Because those who buy gasoline are the same people who use the 
benefits principle
the idea that people 
should pay taxes based on 
the benefits they receive 
from government services

CHAPTER 12    The Design of the Tax System
roads, the gasoline tax might be viewed as a fair way to pay for this government 
service.
The benefits principle can also be used to argue that wealthy citizens should 
pay higher taxes than poorer ones. Why? Simply because the wealthy benefit 
more from public services. Consider, for example, the benefits of police protection 
from theft. Citizens with much to protect benefit more from police than do those 
with less to protect. Therefore, according to the benefits principle, the wealthy 
should contribute more than the poor to the cost of maintaining the police force. 
The same argument can be used for many other public services, such as fire 
protection, national defense, and the court system.
It is even possible to use the benefits principle to argue for antipoverty pro-
grams funded by taxes on the wealthy. As we discussed in Chapter 11, people 
may prefer living in a society without poverty, suggesting that antipoverty pro-
grams are a public good. If the wealthy place a greater dollar value on this public 
good than members of the middle class do, perhaps just because the wealthy have 
more to spend, then according to the benefits principle, they should be taxed more 
heavily to pay for these programs.
The Ability-to-Pay Principle
Another way to evaluate the equity of a tax system is called the ability-to-pay 
principle, which states that taxes should be levied on a person according to how 
well that person can shoulder the burden. This principle is sometimes justified by 
the claim that all citizens should make an “equal sacrifice” to support the govern-
ment. The magnitude of a person’s sacrifice, however, depends not only on the 
size of his tax payment but also on his income and other circumstances. A $1,000 
tax paid by a poor person may require a larger sacrifice than a $10,000 tax paid 
by a rich one.
The ability-to-pay principle leads to two corollary notions of equity: vertical 
equity and horizontal equity. Vertical equity states that taxpayers with a greater 
ability to pay taxes should contribute a larger amount. Horizontal equity states 
that taxpayers with similar abilities to pay should contribute the same amount. 
These notions of equity are widely accepted, but applying them to evaluate a tax 
system is rarely straightforward. 
Vertical Equity  If taxes are based on ability to pay, then richer taxpayers 
should pay more than poorer taxpayers. But how much more should the rich pay? 
Much of the debate over tax policy concerns this question.
Consider the three tax systems in Table 7. In each case, taxpayers with higher 
incomes pay more. Yet the systems differ in how quickly taxes rise with income.

The first system is called proportional because all taxpayers pay the same fraction 
of income. The second system is called regressive because high-income taxpayers 
pay a smaller fraction of their income, even though they pay a larger amount. The 
third system is called progressive because high-income taxpayers pay a larger 
fraction of their income. 
Which of these three tax systems is most fair? There is no obvious answer, and 
economic theory does not offer any help in trying to find one. Equity, like beauty, 
is in the eye of the beholder.
How the Tax Burden Is Distributed
Much debate over tax policy concerns whether the wealthy pay their fair share. 
There is no objective way to make this judgment. In evaluating the issue for your-
self, however, it is useful to know how much families with different incomes pay 
under the current tax system.
	
Table 8 presents some data on how all federal taxes are distributed among 
income classes. To construct this table, families are ranked according to their 
income and placed into five groups of equal size, called quintiles. The table also 
presents data on the richest 1 percent of Americans.
	
The second column of the table shows the average income of each group. The 
poorest one-fifth of families had average income of $17,200, and the richest one-
fifth had average income of $248,400. The richest 1 percent had average income of 
over $1.7 million.
	
The next column of the table shows total taxes as a percentage of income. As 
you can see, the U.S. federal tax system is progressive. The poorest fifth of families 
paid 4.3 percent of their incomes in taxes, and the richest fifth paid 25.8 percent. 
The top 1 percent paid 31.2 percent of their incomes.
	
The fourth and fifth columns compare the distribution of income and the dis-
tribution of taxes. The poorest quintile earns 3.9 percent of all income and pays 
0.8 percent of all taxes. The richest quintile earns 55.7 percent of all income and 
pays 69.3 percent of all taxes. The richest 1 percent (which, remember, is 1/20 the 
size of each quintile) earns 18.8 percent of all income and pays 28.3 percent of all 
taxes.

CHAPTER 12    The Design of the Tax System
	
This table on taxes is a good starting point for understanding the burden of 
government, but the picture it offers is incomplete. Although it includes all the 
taxes that flow from households to the federal government, it fails to include the 
transfer payments, such as Social Security and welfare, that flow from the federal 
government back to households. 
	
Studies that include both taxes and transfers show even greater progressiv-
ity. The richest group of families still pays about one-quarter of its income to the 
government, even after transfers are subtracted. By contrast, poor families typi-
cally receive more in transfers than they pay in taxes. The average tax rate of the 
poorest quintile, rather than being 4.3 percent as in the table, is approximately 
negative 30 percent. In other words, their income is about 30 percent higher than it 
would be without government taxes and transfers. The lesson is clear: To under-
stand fully the progressivity of government policies, one must take account of 
both what people pay and what they receive.  ■
Horizontal Equity  If taxes are based on ability to pay, then similar taxpayers 
should pay similar amounts of taxes. But what determines if two taxpayers are 
similar? Families differ in many ways. To evaluate whether a tax code is horizon-
tally equitable, one must determine which differences are relevant for a family’s 
ability to pay and which differences are not.
Suppose the Smith and Jones families each have income of $100,000. The Smiths 
have no children, but Mr. Smith has an illness that causes medical expenses of 
$40,000. The Joneses are in good health, but they have four children. Two of the Jones 
children are in college, generating tuition bills of $60,000. Would it be fair for these 
two families to pay the same tax because they have the same income? Would it be fair 
to give the Smiths a tax break to help them offset their high medical expenses? Would 
it be fair to give the Joneses a tax break to help them with their tuition expenses?
There are no easy answers to these questions. In practice, the U.S. income 
tax is filled with special provisions that alter a family’s tax based on its specific 
circumstances. 
Tax Incidence and Tax Equity
Tax incidence—the study of who bears the burden of taxes—is central to evaluat-
ing tax equity. As we first saw in Chapter 6, the person who bears the burden of 
a tax is not always the person who gets the tax bill from the government. Because 
taxes alter supply and demand, they alter equilibrium prices. As a result, they 
affect people beyond those who, according to statute, actually pay the tax. When 
evaluating the vertical and horizontal equity of any tax, it is important to take 
these indirect effects into account.
Many discussions of tax equity ignore the indirect effects of taxes and are based 
on what economists mockingly call the flypaper theory of tax incidence. According 
to this theory, the burden of a tax, like a fly on flypaper, sticks wherever it first 
lands. This assumption, however, is rarely valid. 
For example, a person not trained in economics might argue that a tax on 
expensive fur coats is vertically equitable because most buyers of furs are wealthy. 
Yet if these buyers can easily substitute other luxuries for furs, then a tax on furs 
might only reduce the sale of furs. In the end, the burden of the tax will fall more 
on those who make and sell furs than on those who buy them. Because most 
workers who make furs are not wealthy, the equity of a fur tax could be quite dif-
ferent from what the flypaper theory indicates.

Who Pays the Corporate Income Tax?
The corporate income tax provides a good example of the importance of tax inci-
dence for tax policy. The corporate tax is popular among voters. After all, corpora-
tions are not people. Voters are always eager to have their taxes reduced and have 
some impersonal corporation pick up the tab.
	
But before deciding that the corporate income tax is a good way for the govern-
ment to raise revenue, we should consider who bears the burden of the corporate 
tax. This is a difficult question on which economists disagree, but one thing is 
certain: People pay all taxes. When the government levies a tax on a corporation, 
the corporation is more like a tax collector than a taxpayer. The burden of the tax 
ultimately falls on people—the owners, customers, or workers of the corporation.
Much to Love, and 
Hate, in a VAT
By N. Gregory Mankiw
T
he policy world is abuzz with talk about 
whether a value-added tax should be 
part of the solution to our long-term fiscal 
problems. Most recently, Paul A. Volcker, 
head of President Obama’s economic advi-
sory board, said a VAT was “not as toxic an 
idea” as it used to be. 
	
But is it actually a good idea? Regardless 
of whether your politics lean left or right, the 
VAT gives you some things to love and some 
to hate. 
	
Let’s start with the basics. Economists 
define a business’s “value added” as the 
revenue it gets from the sale of goods and 
services, minus the amount it pays for goods 
and services. So, for example, if a farmer sells 
wheat to a miller for $1, the miller sells flour 
to a baker for $2, and the baker sells bread 
to a customer for $3, each of the three pro-
ducers has a value-added of $1. 
	
(For simplicity, I am assuming that the 
farmer does not buy anything to grow the 
wheat.) 
	
Now let’s invoke a piece of advanced 
mathematics: $1 + $1 + $1 = $3. That 
is, the value of the final product—the $3 
bread—is the sum of the value-added along 
the chain of production. 
	
This leads to the first and most impor-
tant insight about a value-added tax: It is 
essentially the same as a retail sales tax. The 
government could impose, say, a 10 percent 
retail sales tax, causing the baker to add 30 
cents to the price of bread. Or it could impose 
a 10 percent tax on value-added. In this case, 
the farmer raises the price of wheat to $1.10, 
the miller raises the price of flour to $2.20 
(reflecting both the tax and the higher price 
of wheat), and the baker raises the price of 
bread to $3.30. Either way, the consumer 
pays 10 percent more for the final product. 
	
Although a value-added tax is just 
another form of a retail sales tax, a VAT has 
the advantage of being harder to evade. Tax 
experts believe that large retail sales taxes 
lead to compliance problems, which we can 
avoid by collecting the same tax along the 
chain of production. 
	
So that’s what a VAT is. What is there to 
love and hate about it? 
	
For liberals, the main advantage of a VAT 
is that it would be a source of revenue to 
 The Value-Added Tax
In 2010, as the U.S. government faced large budget deficits over a long 
time horizon, some policymakers started wondering whether a new 
source of tax revenue was needed. One widely discussed option was a 
value-added tax.

CHAPTER 12    The Design of the Tax System
	
Many economists believe that workers and customers bear much of the burden 
of the corporate income tax. To see why, consider an example. Suppose that the 
U.S. government decides to raise the tax on the income earned by car companies. 
At first, this tax hurts the owners of the car companies, who receive less profit. 
But over time, these owners will respond to the tax. Because producing cars is less 
profitable, they invest less in building new car factories. Instead, they invest their 
wealth in other ways—for example, by buying larger houses or by building fac-
tories in other industries or other countries. With fewer car factories, the supply 
of cars declines, as does the demand for autoworkers. Thus, a tax on corporations 
making cars causes the price of cars to rise and the wages of autoworkers to fall. 
	
The corporate income tax shows how dangerous the flypaper theory of tax 
incidence can be. The corporate income tax is popular in part because it appears 
to be paid by rich corporations. Yet those who bear the ultimate burden of the 
tax—the customers and workers of corporations—are often not rich. If the true 
incidence of the corporate tax were more widely known, this tax might be less 
popular among voters.  ■

fund a robust, compassionate government. 
Over the past century in the United States, 
the federal government has expanded the 
social safety net, including programs like 
Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and, 
most recently, the insurance subsidies in Mr. 
Obama’s health care overhaul. Yet Congress 
has been more successful promising benefits 
than finding the revenue to pay for them. A 
VAT could solve that problem. 
	
Yet liberals balk at the distributional 
impact of a VAT. The tax has the same effect 
on rich and poor, as gauged by a proportion 
of their spending. But because high-income 
households save a higher fraction of their 
income, they will pay a lower fraction of 
their income. 
	
Whether this distribution of the tax bur-
den is fair is open to debate. (What is indis-
putable is that adding it without subtracting 
something else would violate Mr. Obama’s 
campaign pledge not to raise taxes on fami-
lies making less than $250,000 a year.) 
	
Conservatives emphasize an altogether 
different set of concerns. For them, the main 
disadvantage of a VAT is that it would be a 
source of revenue to fund a large, intrusive 
government. 
	
Western Europe is a case in point. 
Many nations there have large govern-
ments financed in part by value-added 
taxes. Europeans also typically work less 
than Americans and, as a result, have 
lower income per person. While sorting out 
cause-and-effect among these international 
differences is hard, many conservatives 
agree with Edward C. Prescott, a Nobel 
laureate in economics whose research sug-
gests that Europe’s lower income is largely 
attributable to its higher tax rates. 
	
On the other hand, conservatives have 
long argued that the American tax system 
is grossly inefficient and impedes the econ-
omy’s ability to reach its full potential. They 
contend that taxing consumption is better 
than taxing income, and a value-added tax 
does exactly that. 
	
Moreover, a VAT is the twin of the flat 
tax that conservatives sometimes advocate. 
To see why, imagine that we 
started with a VAT. Then we add 
a wrinkle: We allow businesses to 
deduct wages, in addition to the 
cost of goods and services. We also 
require households to pay a tax on 
their wage income. 
	        Other than shifting the respon-
sibility for the tax on wages from 
the business to the household, it 
might seem that we haven’t done 
anything significant. Indeed, we 
haven’t. But the new tax system 
would no longer be a VAT. It 
would be the flat tax that Robert E. Hall 
and Alvin Rabushka first proposed back 
in 1981. 
	
So why, if these two tax systems are 
really the same, are conservatives attracted 
to the flat tax and repelled by the VAT? It 
is because the flat tax is usually proposed 
as a substitute for our current tax system, 
whereas the VAT is often suggested as an 
addition to it. 
	
The bottom line, from both political per-
spectives, is that a VAT is neither blessed nor 
evil. It is a tool. We can use it to advance 
a larger government, a more efficient tax 
system, or some combination of the two. 
	
That will be the key issue in the coming 
debate.

Summary
Quick Quiz  Explain the benefits principle and the ability-to-pay principle. • What 
are vertical equity and horizontal equity? • Why is studying tax incidence important 
for determining the equity of a tax system?
Conclusion: The Trade-off between Equity and Efficiency
Almost everyone agrees that equity and efficiency are the two most important 
goals of a tax system. But these two goals often conflict, especially when equity 
is judged by the progressivity of the tax system. People disagree about tax policy 
often because they attach different weights to these goals.
The recent history of tax policy shows how political leaders differ in their 
views on equity and efficiency. When Ronald Reagan was elected president in 
1980, the marginal tax rate on the earnings of the richest Americans was 50 per-
cent. On interest income, the marginal tax rate was 70 percent. Reagan argued 
that such high tax rates greatly distorted economic incentives to work and save. 
In other words, he claimed that these high tax rates cost too much in terms of 
economic efficiency. Tax reform was, therefore, a high priority of his adminis-
tration. Reagan signed into law large cuts in tax rates in 1981 and then again in 
1986. When Reagan left office in 1989, the richest Americans faced a marginal 
tax rate of only 28 percent.
The pendulum of political debate swings both ways. When Bill Clinton ran 
for president in 1992, he argued that the rich were not paying their fair share 
of taxes. In other words, the low tax rates on the rich violated his view of ver-
tical equity. In 1993, President Clinton signed into law a bill that raised the 
tax rates on the richest Americans to about 40 percent. When George W. Bush 
ran for president, he reprised many of Reagan’s themes, and as president he 
reversed part of the Clinton tax increase, reducing the highest tax rate to 35 
percent. Barack Obama pledged during the 2008 presidential campaign that he 
would raise taxes on high-income households, and it looks likely that during his 
presidency the top marginal tax rate will increase to levels not seen since Ronald 
Reagan took office.
Economics alone cannot determine the best way to balance the goals of effi-
ciency and equity. This issue involves political philosophy as well as economics. 
But economists have an important role in this debate: They can shed light on 
the trade-offs that society inevitably faces when designing the tax system and 
can help us avoid policies that sacrifice efficiency without any benefit in terms 
of equity.
• The U.S. government raises revenue using vari-
ous taxes. The most important taxes for the 
federal government are individual income taxes 
and payroll taxes for social insurance. The most 
important taxes for state and local governments 
are sales taxes and property taxes.
• The efficiency of a tax system refers to the costs 
it imposes on taxpayers. There are two costs 
of taxes beyond the transfer of resources from 
the taxpayer to the government. The first is the 
deadweight loss that arises as taxes alter incen-
tives and distort the allocation of resources. The

second is the administrative burden of comply-
ing with the tax laws.
• The equity of a tax system concerns whether the tax 
burden is distributed fairly among the population. 
According to the benefits principle, it is fair for peo-
ple to pay taxes based on the benefits they receive 
from the government. According to the ability-to-
pay principle, it is fair for people to pay taxes based 
on their capability to handle the financial burden. 
When evaluating the equity of a tax system, it is 
important to remember a lesson from the study 
of tax incidence: The distribution of tax burdens is 
not the same as the distribution of tax bills.
• When considering changes in the tax laws, policy­
makers often face a trade-off between efficiency 
and equity. Much of the debate over tax policy 
arises because people give different weights to 
these two goals.

b.	Looking at the combined revenue of the 
federal government and state and local 
governments, how has the composition 
of total revenue changed over time? 
Are personal income taxes more or less 
important? Social insurance taxes? Corporate 
profits taxes?
c.	 Looking at the combined expenditures of 
the federal government and state and local 
governments, how have the relative shares 
of transfer payments and purchases of goods 
and services changed over time?
	 3.	 The chapter states that the elderly population in 
the United States is growing more rapidly than 
the total population. In particular, the number 
of workers is rising slowly, while the number  
of retirees is rising quickly. Concerned about  
the future of Social Security, some members  
of Congress propose a “freeze” on the  
program.
a.	 If total expenditures were frozen, what 
would happen to benefits per retiree? To tax 
payments per worker? (Assume that Social 
Security taxes and receipts are balanced in 
each year.)
b.	If benefits per retiree were frozen, what 
would happen to total expenditures? To tax 
payments per worker?
c.	 If tax payments per worker were frozen, 
what would happen to total expenditures? To 
benefits per retiree?
d.	What do your answers to parts (a), (b), and 
(c) imply about the difficult decisions faced 
by policymakers?
	 4.	 Suppose you are a typical person in the U.S. 
economy. You pay 4 percent of your income in 
a state income tax and 15.3 percent of your labor 
earnings in federal payroll taxes (employer 
and employee shares combined). You also pay 
federal income taxes as in Table 3. How much 
tax of each type do you pay if you earn $20,000 
a year? Taking all taxes into account, what are 
your average and marginal tax rates? What 
happens to your tax bill and to your average 
and marginal tax rates if your income rises to 
$40,000?
	 5.	 Some states exclude necessities, such as food 
and clothing, from their sales tax. Other states 
do not. Discuss the merits of this exclusion. 
Consider both efficiency and equity.
	 6.	 When someone owns an asset (such as a share 
of stock) that rises in value, he has an “accrued” 
capital gain. If he sells the asset, he “realizes” 
the gains that have previously accrued. Under 
the U.S. income tax, realized capital gains are 
taxed, but accrued gains are not. 
a.	 Explain how individuals’ behavior is affected 
by this rule. 
b.	Some economists believe that cuts in capital 
gains tax rates, especially temporary ones, 
can raise tax revenue. How might this be so?
c.	 Do you think it is a good rule to tax realized 
but not accrued capital gains? Why or why 
not?
	 7.	 Suppose that your state raises its sales tax 
from 5 percent to 6 percent. The state revenue 
commissioner forecasts a 20 percent increase in 
sales tax revenue. Is this plausible? Explain.
	 8.	 The Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated the 
deductibility of interest payments on consumer 
debt (mostly credit cards and auto loans) 
but maintained the deductibility of interest 
payments on mortgages and home equity loans. 
What do you think happened to the relative 
amounts of borrowing through consumer debt 
and home equity debt?
	 9.	 Categorize each of the following funding 
schemes as examples of the benefits principle or 
the ability-to-pay principle.
a.	 Visitors to many national parks pay an 
entrance fee.
b.	Local property taxes support elementary and 
secondary schools.
c.	 An airport trust fund collects a tax on each 
plane ticket sold and uses the money to 
improve airports and the air traffic control 
system.
	10.	 Any income tax schedule embodies two types 
of tax rates: average tax rates and marginal tax 
rates.
a.	 The average tax rate is defined as total taxes 
paid divided by income. For the proportional 
tax system presented in Table 7, what are 
the average tax rates for people earning 
$50,000, $100,000, and $200,000? What are 
the corresponding average tax rates in the 
regressive and progressive tax systems?
b.	The marginal tax rate is defined as the extra 
taxes paid on additional income divided 
by the increase in income. Calculate the 
marginal tax rate for the proportional tax 
system as income rises from $50,000 to 
$100,000. Calculate the marginal tax rate 
as income rises from $100,000 to $200,000.

CHAPTER 12    The Design of the Tax System
Calculate the corresponding marginal tax 
rates for the regressive and progressive tax 
systems.
c.	 Describe the relationship between average 
tax rates and marginal tax rates for each of 
these three systems. In general, which rate 
is relevant for someone deciding whether 
to accept a job that pays slightly more than 
her current job? Which rate is relevant for 
judging the vertical equity of a tax system?
	12.	 Each of the following expenditures is a 
deduction for the purposes of calculating a 
person’s federal income tax liability:
a.	 Mortgage interest
b.	State and local taxes
c.	 Charitable contributions
If the income tax base were broadened by 
eliminating these deductions, tax rates could be 
lowered, while raising the same amount of tax 
revenue. 
For each of these deductions, what would you 
expect the likely effect on taxpayer behavior to 
be? Discuss the pros and cons of each deduction 
from the standpoint of efficiency, vertical equity, 
and horizontal equity. Would you keep or 
eliminate the deduction?
