irms that make and sell paper also create, as a by-product of the manufac-
turing process, a chemical called dioxin. Scientists believe that once dioxin 
enters the environment, it raises the population’s risk of cancer, birth 
defects, and other health problems.
Is the production and release of dioxin a problem for society? In Chapters 4 
through 9, we examined how markets allocate scarce resources with the forces 
of supply and demand, and we saw that the equilibrium of supply and demand 
is typically an efficient allocation of resources. To use Adam Smith’s famous 
metaphor, the “invisible hand” of the marketplace leads self-interested buyers 
and sellers in a market to maximize the total benefit that society derives from 
that market. This insight is the basis for one of the Ten Principles of Economics in 
Chapter 1: Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity. Should 
we conclude, therefore, that the invisible hand prevents firms in the paper market 
from emitting too much dioxin? 
Markets do many things well, but they do not do everything well. In this chapter, 
we begin our study of another of the Ten Principles of Economics: Government

action can sometimes improve upon market outcomes. We examine why mar-
kets sometimes fail to allocate resources efficiently, how government policies can 
potentially improve the market’s allocation, and what kinds of policies are likely 
to work best. 
The market failures examined in this chapter fall under a general category 
called externalities. An externality arises when a person engages in an activity 
that influences the well-being of a bystander but neither pays nor receives any 
compensation for that effect. If the impact on the bystander is adverse, it is called 
a negative externality. If it is beneficial, it is called a positive externality. In the pres-
ence of externalities, society’s interest in a market outcome extends beyond the 
well-being of buyers and sellers who participate in the market to include the 
well-being of bystanders who are affected indirectly. Because buyers and sellers 
neglect the external effects of their actions when deciding how much to demand 
or supply, the market equilibrium is not efficient when there are externalities. That 
is, the equilibrium fails to maximize the total benefit to society as a whole. The 
release of dioxin into the environment, for instance, is a negative externality. Self-
interested paper firms will not consider the full cost of the pollution they create in 
their production process, and consumers of paper will not consider the full cost of 
the pollution they contribute from their purchasing decisions. Therefore, the firms 
will emit too much pollution unless the government prevents or discourages them 
from doing so.
Externalities come in many varieties, as do the policy responses that try to deal 
with the market failure. Here are some examples:
• 	 The exhaust from automobiles is a negative externality because it creates 
smog that other people have to breathe. As a result of this externality, 
drivers tend to pollute too much. The federal government attempts to solve 
this problem by setting emission standards for cars. It also taxes gasoline to 
reduce the amount that people drive.
• 	 Restored historic buildings convey a positive externality because people 
who walk or ride by them can enjoy the beauty and the sense of history 
that these buildings provide. Building owners do not get the full benefit of 
restoration and, therefore, tend to discard older buildings too quickly. Many 
local governments respond to this problem by regulating the destruction of 
historic buildings and by providing tax breaks to owners who restore them.
• 	 Barking dogs create a negative externality because neighbors are disturbed 
by the noise. Dog owners do not bear the full cost of the noise and, 
therefore, tend to take too few precautions to prevent their dogs from 
barking. Local governments address this problem by making it illegal to 
“disturb the peace.”
• 	 Research into new technologies provides a positive externality because it 
creates knowledge that other people can use. Because inventors cannot 
capture the full benefits of their inventions, they tend to devote too few 
resources to research. The federal government addresses this problem 
partially through the patent system, which gives inventors exclusive use of 
their inventions for a limited time.
In each of these cases, some decision maker fails to take account of the external 
effects of his or her behavior. The government responds by trying to influence this 
behavior to protect the interests of bystanders.

CHAPTER 10   Externalities
Externalities and Market Inefficiency
In this section, we use the tools of welfare economics developed in Chapter 7 to 
examine how externalities affect economic well-being. The analysis shows pre-
cisely why externalities cause markets to allocate resources inefficiently. Later in 
the chapter, we examine various ways in which private individuals and public 
policymakers may remedy this type of market failure.
Welfare Economics: A Recap
We begin by recalling the key lessons of welfare economics from Chapter 7. 
To make our analysis concrete, we consider a specific market—the market 
for aluminum. Figure 1 shows the supply and demand curves in the market for 
aluminum. 
As you should recall from Chapter 7, the supply and demand curves contain 
important information about costs and benefits. The demand curve for aluminum 
reflects the value of aluminum to consumers, as measured by the prices they are 
willing to pay. At any given quantity, the height of the demand curve shows 
the willingness to pay of the marginal buyer. In other words, it shows the value 
to the consumer of the last unit of aluminum bought. Similarly, the supply curve 
reflects the costs of producing aluminum. At any given quantity, the height of 
the supply curve shows the cost to the marginal seller. In other words, it shows 
the cost to the producer of the last unit of aluminum sold.
In the absence of government intervention, the price adjusts to balance the 
supply and demand for aluminum. The quantity produced and consumed in the 
market equilibrium, shown as QMARKET in Figure 1, is efficient in the sense that it 
maximizes the sum of producer and consumer surplus. That is, the market allo-
cates resources in a way that maximizes the total value to the consumers who 
buy and use aluminum minus the total costs to the producers who make and sell 
aluminum.
Figure 1
The Market for Aluminum
The demand curve reflects the value  
to buyers, and the supply curve reflects 
the costs of sellers. The equilibrium 
quantity, QMARKET, maximizes the total 
value to buyers minus the total  
costs of sellers. In the absence of 
externalities, therefore, the market 
equilibrium is efficient.

Negative Externalities
Now let’s suppose that aluminum factories emit pollution: For each unit of alu-
minum produced, a certain amount of smoke enters the atmosphere. Because this 
smoke creates a health risk for those who breathe the air, it is a negative externality. 
How does this externality affect the efficiency of the market outcome?
Because of the externality, the cost to society of producing aluminum is larger 
than the cost to the aluminum producers. For each unit of aluminum produced, 
the social cost includes the private costs of the aluminum producers plus the costs 
to those bystanders affected adversely by the pollution. Figure 2 shows the social 
cost of producing aluminum. The social-cost curve is above the supply curve 
because it takes into account the external costs imposed on society by aluminum 
production. The difference between these two curves reflects the cost of the pollu­
tion emitted.
What quantity of aluminum should be produced? To answer this question, 
we once again consider what a benevolent social planner would do. The plan-
ner wants to maximize the total surplus derived from the market—the value to 
consumers of aluminum minus the cost of producing aluminum. The planner 
understands, however, that the cost of producing aluminum includes the external 
costs of the pollution.
The planner would choose the level of aluminum production at which the 
demand curve crosses the social-cost curve. This intersection determines the opti-
mal amount of aluminum from the standpoint of society as a whole. Below this 
level of production, the value of the aluminum to consumers (as measured by the 
height of the demand curve) exceeds the social cost of producing it (as measured 
by the height of the social-cost curve). The planner does not produce more than 
this level because the social cost of producing additional aluminum exceeds the 
value to consumers.
Note that the equilibrium quantity of aluminum, QMARKET, is larger than the 
socially optimal quantity, QOPTIMUM. This inefficiency occurs because the market

CHAPTER 10   Externalities
equilibrium reflects only the private costs of production. In the market equilib-
rium, the marginal consumer values aluminum at less than the social cost of 
producing it. That is, at QMARKET, the demand curve lies below the social-cost 
curve. Thus, reducing aluminum production and consumption below the market 
equilibrium level raises total economic well-being.
How can the social planner achieve the optimal outcome? One way would be 
to tax aluminum producers for each ton of aluminum sold. The tax would shift 
the supply curve for aluminum upward by the size of the tax. If the tax accu-
rately reflected the external cost of pollutants released into the atmosphere, the 
new supply curve would coincide with the social-cost curve. In the new market 
equilibrium, aluminum producers would produce the socially optimal quantity 
of aluminum. 
The use of such a tax is called internalizing the externality because it 
gives buyers and sellers in the market an incentive to take into account the 
external effects of their actions. Aluminum producers would, in essence, take 
the costs of pollution into account when deciding how much aluminum to 
supply because the tax would make them pay for these external costs. And, 
because the market price would reflect the tax on producers, consumers of 
aluminum would have an incentive to use a smaller quantity. The policy is 
based on one of the Ten Principles of Economics: People respond to incentives. 
Later in this chapter, we consider in more detail how policymakers can deal 
with externalities.
Positive Externalities
Although some activities impose costs on third parties, others yield benefits. For 
example, consider education. To a large extent, the benefit of education is private: 
The consumer of education becomes a more productive worker and thus reaps 
much of the benefit in the form of higher wages. Beyond these private benefits, 
however, education also yields positive externalities. One externality is that a 
more educated population leads to more informed voters, which means better 
government for everyone. Another externality is that a more educated popula-
tion tends to mean lower crime rates. A third externality is that a more educated 
population may encourage the development and dissemination of technological 
advances, leading to higher productivity and wages for everyone. Because of 
these three positive externalities, a person may prefer to have neighbors who are 
well educated. 
The analysis of positive externalities is similar to the analysis of negative exter-
nalities. As Figure 3 shows, the demand curve does not reflect the value to society 
of the good. Because the social value is greater than the private value, the social-
value curve lies above the demand curve. The optimal quantity is found where 
the social-value curve and the supply curve (which represents costs) intersect. 
Hence, the socially optimal quantity is greater than the quantity determined by 
the private market. 
Once again, the government can correct the market failure by inducing market 
participants to internalize the externality. The appropriate response in the case 
of positive externalities is exactly the opposite to the case of negative exter­
nalities. To move the market equilibrium closer to the social optimum, a positive 
externality requires a subsidy. In fact, that is exactly the policy the government 
follows: Education is heavily subsidized through public schools and government 
scholarships.

The Lorax Was 
Wrong: Skyscrapers 
Are Green
By Edward L. Glaeser
 I
n Dr. Seuss’ environmentalist fable, “The 
Lorax,” the Once-ler, a budding textile mag-
nate, chops down Truffula to knit “Thneeds.” 
	
Over the protests of the environmentally 
sensitive Lorax, the Once-ler builds a great 
industrial town that despoils the environment, 
because he “had to grow bigger.” Even­tually, 
the Once-ler overdoes it, and he chops down 
the last Truffula tree, destroying the source of 
his income. Chastened, Dr. Seuss’s industrialist 
turns green, urging a young listener to take 
the last Truffula seed and plant a new forest. 
	
Some of the lessons told by this story 
are correct. From a purely profit-maximizing 
point of view, the Once-ler is pretty inept, 
because he kills his golden goose. Any good 
management consultant would have told 
him to manage his growth more wisely. 
One aspect of the story’s environmentalist 
message, that bad things happen when we 
overfish a common pool, is also correct. 
	
But the unfortunate aspect of the story 
is that urbanization comes off terribly. The 
forests are good; the factories are bad. Not 
only does the story disparage the remarkable 
benefits that came from the mass pro-
duction of clothing in 19th-century textile 
towns, it sends exactly the wrong message 
on the environment. Contrary to the story’s 
implied message, living in cities is green, 
while living surrounded by forests is brown. 
	
By building taller and taller buildings, 
the Once-ler was proving himself to be the 
real environmentalist.

income. We added in carbon emissions from 
home electricity and home heating. . . .
	
In almost every metropolitan area, we 
found the central city residents emitted less 
carbon than the suburban counterparts. In 
New York and San Francisco, the average 
urban family emits more than two tons less 
carbon annually because it drives less. In 
Nashville, the city-suburb carbon gap due 
to driving is more than three tons. After all, 
density is the defining characteristic of cities. 
All that closeness means that people need to 
travel shorter distances, and that shows up 
clearly in the data. 
	
While public transportation certainly 
uses much less energy, per rider, than 
driving, large carbon reductions are pos-
sible without any switch to buses or rails. 
Higher-density suburban areas, which are 
still entirely car-dependent, still involve a lot 
less travel than the really sprawling places. 
This fact offers some hope for greens eager 
to reduce carbon emissions, since it is a lot 
easier to imagine Americans driving shorter 
distances than giving up their cars. 
	
But cars represent only one-third of 
the gap in carbon emissions between New 
Yorkers and their suburbanites. The gap in 
electricity usage between New York City 
and its suburbs is also about two tons. 
The gap in emissions from home heating 
is almost three tons. All told, we estimate 
a seven-ton difference in carbon emis-
sions between the residents of Manhattan’s 
urban aeries and the good burghers of 
Westchester County. Living surrounded by 
concrete is actually pretty green. Living sur-
rounded by trees is not. 
	
The policy prescription that follows from 
this is that environmentalists should be 
championing the growth of more and taller 
skyscrapers. Every new crane in New York 
City means less low-density development. 
The environmental ideal should be an apart-
ment in downtown San Francisco, not a 
ranch in Marin County.
	
Of course, many environmentalists will 
still prefer to take their cue from Henry David 
Thoreau, who advocated living alone in the 
woods. They would do well to remember 
that Thoreau, in a sloppy chowder-cooking 
moment, burned down 300 acres of prime 
Concord woodland. Few Boston merchants 
did as much environmental harm, which sug-
gests that if you want to take good care of 
the environment, stay away from it and live 
in cities. 
To summarize: Negative externalities lead markets to produce a larger quantity than 
is socially desirable. Positive externalities lead markets to produce a smaller quantity than 
is socially desirable. To remedy the problem, the government can internalize the exter­
nality by taxing goods that have negative externalities and subsidizing goods that have 
positive externalities.
Technology Spillovers, Industrial Policy, and  
Patent Protection
A potentially important type of positive externality is called a technology spillover—
the impact of one firm’s research and production efforts on other firms’ access to 
technological advance. For example, consider the market for industrial robots. 
Robots are at the frontier of a rapidly changing technology. Whenever a firm 
builds a robot, there is some chance that the firm will discover a new and better 
design. This new design may benefit not only this firm but society as a whole 
because the design will enter society’s pool of technological knowledge. That 
is, the new design may have positive externalities for other producers in the 
economy.

The Economics of the Public Sector
In this case, the government can internalize the externality by subsidizing the 
production of robots. If the government paid firms a subsidy for each robot pro-
duced, the supply curve would shift down by the amount of the subsidy, and this 
shift would increase the equilibrium quantity of robots. To ensure that the market 
equilibrium equals the social optimum, the subsidy should equal the value of the 
technology spillover.
How large are technology spillovers, and what do they imply for public policy? 
This is an important question because technological progress is the key to why 
living standards rise over time. Yet it is also a difficult question on which econo-
mists often disagree. 
Some economists believe that technology spillovers are pervasive and that the 
government should encourage those industries that yield the largest spillovers. 
For instance, these economists argue that if making computer chips yields greater 
spillovers than making potato chips, then the government should encourage the 
production of computer chips relative to the production of potato chips. The U.S. 
tax code does this in a limited way by offering special tax breaks for expenditures 
on research and development. Some other nations go farther by subsidizing spe-
cific industries that supposedly offer large technology spillovers. Government 
intervention in the economy that aims to promote technology-enhancing indus-
tries is sometimes called industrial policy. 
Other economists are skeptical about industrial policy. Even if technology 
spillovers are common, the success of an industrial policy requires that the 
govern­ment be able to measure the size of the spillovers from different markets. 
This measurement problem is difficult at best. Moreover, without precise mea-
surements, the political system may end up subsidizing industries with the most 
political clout rather than those that yield the largest positive externalities.
Another way to deal with technology spillovers is patent protection. The ­patent 
laws protect the rights of inventors by giving them exclusive use of their inventions 
for a period of time. When a firm makes a technological breakthrough, it can patent 
the idea and capture much of the economic benefit for itself. The patent internal-
izes the externality by giving the firm a property right over its invention. If other 
firms want to use the new technology, they have to obtain permission from the 
inventing firm and pay it a royalty. Thus, the patent system gives firms a greater 
incentive to engage in research and other activities that advance technology.  ■

Explain why market outcomes are inefficient in the presence of these externalities.
Public Policies toward Externalities 
We have discussed why externalities lead markets to allocate resources ineffi-
ciently but have mentioned only briefly how this inefficiency can be remedied. 
In practice, both public policymakers and private individuals respond to exter­
nalities in various ways. All of the remedies share the goal of moving the alloca-
tion of resources closer to the social optimum. 
This section considers governmental solutions. As a general matter, the govern-
ment can respond to externalities in one of two ways. Command-and-control policies 
regulate behavior directly. Market-based policies provide incentives so that private 
decision makers will choose to solve the problem on their own.

CHAPTER 10   Externalities
Command-and-Control Policies: Regulation
The government can remedy an externality by making certain behaviors either 
required or forbidden. For example, it is a crime to dump poisonous chemicals 
into the water supply. In this case, the external costs to society far exceed the 
­benefits to the polluter. The government therefore institutes a command-and-
control policy that prohibits this act altogether. 
In most cases of pollution, however, the situation is not this simple. Despite 
the stated goals of some environmentalists, it would be impossible to prohibit 
all polluting activity. For example, virtually all forms of transportation—even 
the horse—produce some undesirable polluting by-products. But it would 
not be sensible for the government to ban all transportation. Thus, instead of 
­trying to eradicate pollution entirely, society has to weigh the costs and bene­
fits to decide the kinds and quantities of pollution it will allow. In the United 
States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the government agency 
with the task of developing and enforcing regulations aimed at protecting the 
environment. 
Environmental regulations can take many forms. Sometimes the EPA dictates a 
maximum level of pollution that a factory may emit. Other times the EPA requires 
that firms adopt a particular technology to reduce emissions. In all cases, to design 
good rules, the government regulators need to know the details about specific 
industries and about the alternative technologies that those industries could 
adopt. This information is often difficult for government regulators to obtain.
Market-Based Policy 1: Corrective Taxes  
and Subsidies
Instead of regulating behavior in response to an externality, the government can 
use market-based policies to align private incentives with social efficiency. For 
instance, as we saw earlier, the government can internalize the externality by 
taxing activities that have negative externalities and subsidizing activities that 
have positive externalities. Taxes enacted to deal with the effects of negative exter-
nalities are called corrective taxes. They are also called Pigovian taxes after econo-
mist Arthur Pigou (1877–1959), an early advocate of their use. An ideal corrective 
tax would equal the external cost from an activity with negative externalities, and 
an ideal corrective subsidy would equal the external benefit from an activity with 
positive externalities.
Economists usually prefer corrective taxes to regulations as a way to deal with 
pollution because they can reduce pollution at a lower cost to society. To see why, 
let us consider an example. 
Suppose that two factories—a paper mill and a steel mill—are each dumping 
500 tons of glop into a river every year. The EPA decides that it wants to reduce 
the amount of pollution. It considers two solutions:
• 	 Regulation: The EPA could tell each factory to reduce its pollution to  
300 tons of glop per year.
• 	 Corrective tax: The EPA could levy a tax on each factory of $50,000 for  
each ton of glop it emits. 
The regulation would dictate a level of pollution, whereas the tax would give fac-
tory owners an economic incentive to reduce pollution. Which solution do you 
think is better?

The Economics of the Public Sector
Most economists prefer the tax. To explain this preference, they would first 
point out that a tax is just as effective as a regulation in reducing the overall level 
of pollution. The EPA can achieve whatever level of pollution it wants by setting 
the tax at the appropriate level. The higher the tax, the larger the reduction in 
pollu­tion. If the tax is high enough, the factories will close down altogether, reduc-
ing pollution to zero. 
Although regulation and corrective taxes are both capable of reducing pollution, 
the tax accomplishes this goal more efficiently. The regulation requires each factory 
to reduce pollution by the same amount. An equal reduction, however, is not neces-
sarily the least expensive way to clean up the water. It is possible that the paper mill 
can reduce pollution at lower cost than the steel mill. If so, the paper mill would 
respond to the tax by reducing pollution substantially to avoid the tax, whereas the 
steel mill would respond by reducing pollution less and paying the tax. 
In essence, the corrective tax places a price on the right to pollute. Just as 
markets allocate goods to those buyers who value them most highly, a corrective 
tax allocates pollution to those factories that face the highest cost of reducing it. 
Whatever the level of pollution the EPA chooses, it can achieve this goal at the 
lowest total cost using a tax.
Economists also argue that corrective taxes are better for the environment. 
Under the command-and-control policy of regulation, the factories have no reason 
to reduce emission further once they have reached the target of 300 tons of glop. 
By contrast, the tax gives the factories an incentive to develop cleaner technologies 
because a cleaner technology would reduce the amount of tax the factory has to pay.
Corrective taxes are unlike most other taxes. As we discussed in Chapter 8, 
most taxes distort incentives and move the allocation of resources away from the 
social optimum. The reduction in economic well-being—that is, in consumer and 
producer surplus—exceeds the amount of revenue the government raises, result-
ing in a deadweight loss. By contrast, when externalities are present, society also 
cares about the well-being of the bystanders who are affected. Corrective taxes 
alter incentives to account for the presence of externalities and thereby move the 
allocation of resources closer to the social optimum. Thus, while corrective taxes 
raise revenue for the government, they also enhance economic efficiency.
Why Is Gasoline Taxed So Heavily? 
In many nations, gasoline is among the most heavily taxed goods. The gas tax 
can be viewed as a corrective tax aimed at addressing three negative externalities 
associated with driving:
• 	 Congestion: If you have ever been stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, you 
have probably wished that there were fewer cars on the road. A gasoline tax 
keeps congestion down by encouraging people to take public transportation, 
carpool more often, and live closer to work. 
• 	 Accidents: Whenever people buy large cars or sport-utility vehicles, they 
may make themselves safer but they certainly put their neighbors at risk. 
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a person 
driving a typical car is five times as likely to die if hit by a sport-utility 
vehicle than if hit by another car. The gas tax is an indirect way of making 
people pay when their large, gas-guzzling vehicles impose risk on others.

It would induce them to take this risk into account when choosing what

• 	 Pollution: Cars cause smog. Moreover, the burning of fossil fuels such as 
gasoline is widely believed to be the primary cause of global warming. 
Experts disagree about how dangerous this threat is, but there is no doubt 
that the gas tax reduces the threat by reducing the use of gasoline.
So the gas tax, rather than causing deadweight losses like most taxes, actually 
makes the economy work better. It means less traffic congestion, safer roads, and 
a cleaner environment.
How high should the tax on gasoline be? Most European countries impose 
gasoline taxes that are much higher than those in the United States. Many observ-
ers have suggested that the United States also should tax gasoline more heavily. A 
2007 study published in the Journal of Economic Literature summarized the research 
on the size of the various externalities associated with driving. It concluded that 
the optimal corrective tax on gasoline was $2.10 per gallon, compared to the actual 
tax in the United States of only 40 cents.
The tax revenue from a gasoline tax could be used to lower taxes that distort 
incentives and cause deadweight losses, such as income taxes. In addition, some 
of the burdensome government regulations that require automakers to produce 
more fuel-efficient cars would prove unnecessary. This idea, however, has never 
proven politically popular.  ■
Market-Based Policy 2: Tradable Pollution Permits
Returning to our example of the paper mill and the steel mill, let us suppose that, 
despite the advice of its economists, the EPA adopts the regulation and requires 
each factory to reduce its pollution to 300 tons of glop per year. Then one day,

The Economics of the Public Sector
after the regulation is in place and both mills have complied, the two firms go to 
the EPA with a proposal. The steel mill wants to increase its emission of glop by 
100 tons. The paper mill has agreed to reduce its emission by the same amount if 
the steel mill pays it $5 million. Should the EPA allow the two factories to make 
this deal?
From the standpoint of economic efficiency, allowing the deal is good policy. 
The deal must make the owners of the two factories better off because they are 
voluntarily agreeing to it. Moreover, the deal does not have any external effects 
because the total amount of pollution remains the same. Thus, social welfare is 
enhanced by allowing the paper mill to sell its pollution rights to the steel mill.
The same logic applies to any voluntary transfer of the right to pollute from 
one firm to another. If the EPA allows firms to make these deals, it will, in essence, 
have created a new scarce resource: pollution permits. A market to trade these 
permits will eventually develop, and that market will be governed by the forces 
of supply and demand. The invisible hand will ensure that this new market allo-
cates the right to pollute efficiently. That is, the permits will end up in the hands 
of those firms that value them most highly, as judged by their willingness to pay. 
A firm’s willingness to pay for the right to pollute, in turn, will depend on its cost 
of reducing pollution: The more costly it is for a firm to cut back on pollution, the 
more it will be willing to pay for a permit.
An advantage of allowing a market for pollution permits is that the initial allo-
cation of pollution permits among firms does not matter from the standpoint of 
economic efficiency. Those firms that can reduce pollution at a low cost will sell 
whatever permits they get, and firms that can reduce pollution only at a high cost 
will buy whatever permits they need. As long as there is a free market for the pollu­
tion rights, the final allocation will be efficient regardless of the initial allocation.
Reducing pollution using pollution permits may seem very different from 
using corrective taxes, but the two policies have much in common. In both cases, 
firms pay for their pollution. With corrective taxes, polluting firms must pay a tax 
to the government. With pollution permits, polluting firms must pay to buy the 
permit. (Even firms that already own permits must pay to pollute: The opportu-
nity cost of polluting is what they could have received by selling their permits 
on the open market.) Both corrective taxes and pollution permits internalize the 
externality of pollution by making it costly for firms to pollute.
The similarity of the two policies can be seen by considering the market for 
pollution. Both panels in Figure 4 show the demand curve for the right to pollute. 
This curve shows that the lower the price of polluting, the more firms will choose 
to pollute. In panel (a), the EPA uses a corrective tax to set a price for pollution. 
In this case, the supply curve for pollution rights is perfectly elastic (because 
firms can pollute as much as they want by paying the tax), and the position of the 
demand curve determines the quantity of pollution. In panel (b), the EPA sets a 
quantity of pollution by issuing pollution permits. In this case, the supply curve 
for pollution rights is perfectly inelastic (because the quantity of pollution is fixed 
by the number of permits), and the position of the demand curve determines 
the price of pollution. Hence, the EPA can achieve any point on a given demand 
curve either by setting a price with a corrective tax or by setting a quantity with 
pollution permits.
In some circumstances, however, selling pollution permits may be better than 
levying a corrective tax. Suppose the EPA wants no more than 600 tons of glop 
dumped into the river. But because the EPA does not know the demand curve

CHAPTER 10   Externalities
for pollution, it is not sure what size tax would achieve that goal. In this case, it 
can simply auction off 600 pollution permits. The auction price would yield the 
appropriate size of the corrective tax.
The idea of the government auctioning off the right to pollute may at first 
sound like a creature of some economist’s imagination. And in fact, that is how 
the idea began. But increasingly, the EPA has used the system as a way to con-
trol pollution. A notable success story has been the case of sulfur dioxide (SO2), 
a leading cause of acid rain. In 1990, amendments to the Clean Air Act required 
power plants to reduce SO2 emissions substantially. At the same time, the amend-
ments set up a system that allowed plants to trade their SO2 allowances. Initially, 
both industry representatives and environmentalists were skeptical of the pro-
posal, but over time the system has reduced pollution with minimal disruption. 
Pollution permits, like corrective taxes, are now widely viewed as a cost-effective 
way to keep the environment clean.
Objections to the Economic Analysis of Pollution
“We cannot give anyone the option of polluting for a fee.” This comment by the 
late Senator Edmund Muskie reflects the view of some environmentalists. Clean 
air and clean water, they argue, are fundamental human rights that should not 
be debased by considering them in economic terms. How can you put a price on 
In panel (a), the EPA sets a price on pollution by levying a corrective tax, and the 
demand curve determines the quantity of pollution. In panel (b), the EPA limits the 
quantity of pollution by limiting the number of pollution permits, and the demand 
curve determines the price of pollution. The price and quantity of pollution are the 
same in the two cases.

clean air and clean water? The environment is so important, they claim, that we 
should protect it as much as possible, regardless of the cost.
Economists have little sympathy for this type of argument. To economists, good 
environmental policy begins by acknowledging the first of the Ten Principles of 
Economics in Chapter 1: People face trade-offs. Certainly, clean air and clean water 
have value. But their value must be compared to their opportunity cost—that 
is, to what one must give up to obtain them. Eliminating all pollution is impos-
sible. Trying to eliminate all pollution would reverse many of the technological 
advances that allow us to enjoy a high standard of living. Few people would be 
willing to accept poor nutrition, inadequate medical care, or shoddy housing to 
make the environment as clean as possible.
Economists argue that some environmental activists hurt their own cause by not 
thinking in economic terms. A clean environment can be viewed as simply another 
good. Like all normal goods, it has a positive income elasticity: Rich countries can 
afford a cleaner environment than poor ones and, therefore, usually have more 
rigorous environmental protection. In addition, like most other goods, clean air 
A Missed Opportunity 
on Climate Change 
By N. Gregory Mankiw
D
uring the presidential campaign of 2008, 
Barack Obama distinguished himself on 
the economics of climate change, speaking 
far more sensibly about the issue than most 
of his rivals. Unfortunately, now that he is 
president, Mr. Obama may sign a climate bill 
that falls far short of his aspirations. Indeed, 
the legislation making its way to his desk 
could well be worse than nothing at all.
	
Let’s start with the basics. The essential 
problem of climate change, scientists tell us, 
is that humans are emitting too much carbon 
into the atmosphere, which tends to raise 
world temperatures. Emitting carbon is what 
economists call a “negative externality”—an 
adverse side effect of certain market activities 
on bystanders.
	
The textbook solution for dealing with 
negative externalities is to use the tax system 
to align private incentives with social costs and 
benefits. Suppose the government imposed a 
tax on carbon-based products and used the 
proceeds to cut other taxes. People would 
have an incentive to shift their consumption 
toward less carbon-intensive products. A car-
bon tax is the remedy for climate change that 
wins overwhelming support among econo-
mists and policy wonks.
	
When he was still a candidate, Mr. 
Obama did not exactly endorse a carbon tax. 
He wanted to be elected, and embracing any 
tax that hits millions of middle-class voters 
is not a recipe for electoral success. But he 
did come tantalizingly close.
	
What Mr. Obama proposed was a 
­cap-and-trade system for carbon, with all 
the allowances sold at auction. In short, the 
system would put a ceiling on the amount 
of carbon released, and companies would 
bid on the right to emit carbon into the 
atmosphere. 
	
Such a system is tantamount to a carbon 
tax. The auction price of an emission right 
is effectively a tax on carbon. The revenue 
raised by the auction gives the government 
the resources to cut other taxes that distort 
behavior, like income or payroll taxes.
	
So far, so good. The problem occurred 
as this sensible idea made the trip from 
the campaign trail through the legislative 
process. Rather than auctioning the carbon

President Obama has proposed a policy to deal with the externalities

and clean water obey the law of demand: The lower the price of environmental 
protection, the more the public will want. The economic approach of using pollu-
tion permits and corrective taxes reduces the cost of environmental protection and 
should, therefore, increase the public’s demand for a clean environment.
Quick Quiz  A glue factory and a steel mill emit smoke containing a chemical that is 
harmful if inhaled in large amounts. Describe three ways the town government might

Private Solutions to Externalities
Although externalities tend to cause markets to be inefficient, government action 
is not always needed to solve the problem. In some circumstances, people can 
develop private solutions.
allowances, the bill that recently passed the 
House would give most of them away to 
powerful special interests. 
	
The numbers involved are not trivial. 
From Congressional Budget Office esti-
mates, one can calculate that if all the 
allowances were auctioned, the government 
could raise $989 billion in proceeds over 
10 years. But in the bill as written, the auc-
tion proceeds are only $276 billion.
	
Mr. Obama understood these risks. When 
asked about a carbon tax in an interview in 
July 2007, he said: “I believe that, depending 
on how it is designed, a carbon tax accom-
plishes much of the same thing that a cap-
and-trade program accomplishes. The danger 
in a cap-and-trade system is that the permits 
to emit greenhouse gases are given away for 
free as opposed to priced at auction. One of 
the mistakes the Europeans made in setting 
up a cap-and-trade system was to give too 
many of those permits away.”
	
Congress is now in the process of 
sending President Obama a bill that makes 
exactly this mistake.
	
How much does it matter? For the pur-
pose of efficiently allocating the carbon 
rights, it doesn’t. Even if these rights are 
handed out on political rather than ­economic 
grounds, the “trade” part of “cap and trade” 
will take care of the rest. Those companies 
with the most need to emit carbon will 
buy carbon allowances on newly formed 
exchanges. Those without such pressing 
needs will sell whatever allowances they are 
given and enjoy the profits that resulted from 
Congress’s largess.
	
The problem arises in how the climate 
policy interacts with the overall tax system. 
As the president pointed out, a cap-and-
trade system is like a carbon tax. The price 
of carbon allowances will eventually be 
passed on to consumers in the form of 
higher prices for carbon-intensive products. 
But if most of those allowances are handed 
out rather than auctioned, the government 
won’t have the resources to cut other taxes 
and offset that price increase. The result is 
an increase in the effective tax rates facing 
most Americans, leading to lower real take-
home wages, reduced work incentives, and 
depressed economic activity.
	
The hard question is whether, on net, 
such a policy is good or bad. Here you can 
find policy wonks on both sides. To those 
who view climate change as an impending 
catastrophe and the distorting effects of 
the tax system as a mere annoyance, an 
imperfect bill is better than none at all. To 
those not fully convinced of the enormity of 
global warming but deeply worried about 
the adverse effects of high current and 
prospective tax rates, the bill is a step in the 
wrong direction.
	
What everyone should agree on is that the 
legislation making its way through Congress 
is a missed opportunity. President Obama 
knows what a good climate bill would look 
like. But despite his immense popularity and 
personal charisma, he appears unable to 
persuade Congress to go along.

The Types of Private Solutions
Sometimes the problem of externalities is solved with moral codes and social 
sanctions. Consider, for instance, why most people do not litter. Although there 
are laws against littering, these laws are not vigorously enforced. Most people 
do not litter just because it is the wrong thing to do. The Golden Rule taught to 
most children says, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” This 
moral injunction tells us to take account of how our actions affect other people. In 
economic terms, it tells us to internalize externalities.
Another private solution to externalities is charities, many of which are estab-
lished to deal with externalities. For example, the Sierra Club, whose goal is to 
protect the environment, is a nonprofit organization funded with private dona-
tions. As another example, colleges and universities receive gifts from alumni, cor-
porations, and foundations in part because education has positive externalities for 
society. The government encourages this private solution to externalities through 
the tax system by allowing an income tax deduction for charitable donations.
The private market can often solve the problem of externalities by relying on 
the self-interest of the relevant parties. Sometimes the solution takes the form of 
integrating different types of businesses. For example, consider an apple grower 
and a beekeeper who are located next to each other. Each business confers a 
positive externality on the other: By pollinating the flowers on the trees, the bees 
help the orchard produce apples. At the same time, the bees use the nectar they 
get from the apple trees to produce honey. Nonetheless, when the apple grower 
is deciding how many trees to plant and the beekeeper is deciding how many 
bees to keep, they neglect the positive externality. As a result, the apple grower 
plants too few trees and the beekeeper keeps too few bees. These externalities 
could be internalized if the beekeeper bought the apple orchard or if the apple 
grower bought the beehives: Both activities would then take place within the 
same firm, and this single firm could choose the optimal number of trees and bees. 
Internalizing externalities is one reason that some firms are involved in different 
types of businesses.
Another way for the private market to deal with external effects is for the inter-
ested parties to enter into a contract. In the foregoing example, a contract between 
the apple grower and the beekeeper can solve the problem of too few trees and 
too few bees. The contract can specify the number of trees, the number of bees, 
and perhaps a payment from one party to the other. By setting the right number 
of trees and bees, the contract can solve the inefficiency that normally arises from 
these externalities and make both parties better off.
The Coase Theorem
How effective is the private market in dealing with externalities? A famous result, 
called the Coase theorem after economist Ronald Coase, suggests that it can be 
very effective in some circumstances. According to the Coase theorem, if private 
parties can bargain over the allocation of resources at no cost, then the private mar-
ket will always solve the problem of externalities and allocate resources efficiently.
To see how the Coase theorem works, consider an example. Suppose that Dick 
owns a dog named Spot. Spot barks and disturbs Jane, Dick’s neighbor. Dick gets 
a benefit from owning the dog, but the dog confers a negative externality on Jane. 
Should Dick be forced to send Spot to the pound, or should Jane have to suffer 
sleepless nights because of Spot’s barking?

CHAPTER 10   Externalities
Consider first what outcome is socially efficient. A social planner, considering 
the two alternatives, would compare the benefit that Dick gets from the dog to 
the cost that Jane bears from the barking. If the benefit exceeds the cost, it is effi-
cient for Dick to keep the dog and for Jane to live with the barking. Yet if the cost 
exceeds the benefit, then Dick should get rid of the dog.
According to the Coase theorem, the private market will reach the efficient 
outcome on its own. How? Jane can simply offer to pay Dick to get rid of the dog. 
Dick will accept the deal if the amount of money Jane offers is greater than the 
benefit of keeping the dog.
By bargaining over the price, Dick and Jane can always reach the efficient out-
come. For instance, suppose that Dick gets a $500 benefit from the dog and Jane 
bears an $800 cost from the barking. In this case, Jane can offer Dick $600 to get rid 
of the dog, and Dick will gladly accept. Both parties are better off than they were 
before, and the efficient outcome is reached.
It is possible, of course, that Jane would not be willing to offer any price that 
Dick would accept. For instance, suppose that Dick gets a $1,000 benefit from the 
dog and Jane bears an $800 cost from the barking. In this case, Dick would turn 
down any offer below $1,000, while Jane would not offer any amount above $800. 
Therefore, Dick ends up keeping the dog. Given these costs and benefits, how-
ever, this outcome is efficient.
So far, we have assumed that Dick has the legal right to keep a barking dog. 
In other words, we have assumed that Dick can keep Spot unless Jane pays him 
enough to induce him to give up the dog voluntarily. But how different would the 
outcome be if Jane had the legal right to peace and quiet?
According to the Coase theorem, the initial distribution of rights does not mat-
ter for the market’s ability to reach the efficient outcome. For instance, suppose 
that Jane can legally compel Dick to get rid of the dog. Having this right works to 
Jane’s advantage, but it probably will not change the outcome. In this case, Dick 
can offer to pay Jane to allow him to keep the dog. If the benefit of the dog to Dick 
exceeds the cost of the barking to Jane, then Dick and Jane will strike a bargain in 
which Dick keeps the dog.
Although Dick and Jane can reach the efficient outcome regardless of how 
rights are initially distributed, the distribution of rights is not irrelevant: It deter-
mines the distribution of economic well-being. Whether Dick has the right to a 
barking dog or Jane the right to peace and quiet determines who pays whom in 
the final bargain. But in either case, the two parties can bargain with each other 
and solve the exter­nality problem. Dick will end up keeping the dog only if the 
benefit exceeds the cost.
To sum up: The Coase theorem says that private economic actors can potentially solve 
the problem of externalities among themselves. Whatever the initial distribution of rights, 
the interested parties can reach a bargain in which everyone is better off and the outcome 
is efficient. 
Why Private Solutions Do Not Always Work
Despite the appealing logic of the Coase theorem, private individuals on their 
own often fail to resolve the problems caused by externalities. The Coase theorem 
applies only when the interested parties have no trouble reaching and enforcing 
an agreement. In the real world, however, bargaining does not always work, even 
when a mutually beneficial agreement is possible.

PART Iv	
The Economics of the Public Sector
Sometimes the interested parties fail to solve an externality problem because 
of transaction costs, the costs that parties incur in the process of agreeing to and 
following through on a bargain. In our example, imagine that Dick and Jane speak 
different languages so that, to reach an agreement, they need to hire a translator. 
If the benefit of solving the barking problem is less than the cost of the translator, 
Dick and Jane might choose to leave the problem unsolved. In more realistic exam-
ples, the transaction costs are the expenses not of translators but of the lawyers 
required to draft and enforce contracts.
At other times, bargaining simply breaks down. The recurrence of wars and 
labor strikes shows that reaching agreement can be difficult and that failing to 
reach agreement can be costly. The problem is often that each party tries to hold 
out for a better deal. For example, suppose that Dick gets a $500 benefit from the 
dog, and Jane bears an $800 cost from the barking. Although it is efficient for Jane 
to pay Dick to get rid of the dog, there are many prices that could lead to this out-
come. Dick might demand $750, and Jane might offer only $550. As they haggle 
over the price, the inefficient outcome with the barking dog persists.
Reaching an efficient bargain is especially difficult when the number of inter-
ested parties is large because coordinating everyone is costly. For example, consider 
a factory that pollutes the water of a nearby lake. The pollution confers a negative 
externality on the local fishermen. According to the Coase theorem, if the pollution 
is inefficient, then the factory and the fishermen could reach a bargain in which 
the fishermen pay the factory not to pollute. If there are many fishermen, however, 
trying to coordinate them all to bargain with the factory may be almost impossible.
When private bargaining does not work, the government can sometimes play 
a role. The government is an institution designed for collective action. In this 
example, the government can act on behalf of the fishermen, even when it is 
impractical for the fishermen to act for themselves.

Coase theorem? • Why are private economic participants sometimes unable to solve 
the problems caused by an externality? 
Conclusion
The invisible hand is powerful but not omnipotent. A market’s equilibrium maxi-
mizes the sum of producer and consumer surplus. When the buyers and sellers in 
the market are the only interested parties, this outcome is efficient from the stand-
point of society as a whole. But when there are external effects, such as pollu­tion, 
evaluating a market outcome requires taking into account the well-being of third 
parties as well. In this case, the invisible hand of the marketplace may fail to allo-
cate resources efficiently.
In some cases, people can solve the problem of externalities on their own. The 
Coase theorem suggests that the interested parties can bargain among themselves 
and agree on an efficient solution. Sometimes, however, an efficient outcome can-
not be reached, perhaps because the large number of interested parties makes 
bargaining difficult.
When people cannot solve the problem of externalities privately, the govern-
ment often steps in. Yet even with government intervention, society should not 
abandon market forces entirely. Rather, the government can address the problem

efficient? How do you and your roommate 
reach this solution?
• When a transaction between a buyer and seller 
directly affects a third party, the effect is called 
an externality. If an activity yields negative exter-
nalities, such as pollution, the socially optimal 
quantity in a market is less than the equilibrium 
quantity. If an activity yields positive externalities, 
such as technology spillovers, the socially optimal 
quantity is greater than the equilibrium quantity.
• Governments pursue various policies to ­remedy 
the inefficiencies caused by externalities. Some­
times the government prevents socially ineffi-
cient activity by regulating behavior. Other times 
it internalizes an externality using ­corrective 
taxes. Another public policy is to issue permits. 
For example, the government could ­protect the 
environment by issuing a limited number of 
pollution permits. The result of this policy is 
largely the same as imposing corrective taxes on 
polluters.
• Those affected by externalities can sometimes 
solve the problem privately. For instance, when 
one business imposes an externality on another 
business, the two businesses can internalize the 
externality by merging. Alternatively, the inter-
ested parties can solve the problem by negotiat-
ing a contract. According to the Coase theorem, 
if people can bargain without cost, then they can 
always reach an agreement in which resources 
are allocated efficiently. In many cases, however, 
reaching a bargain among the many interested 
parties is difficult, so the Coase theorem does 
not apply.

PART Iv	
The Economics of the Public Sector
	 1.	 Consider two ways to protect your car from 
theft. The Club (a steering wheel lock) makes it 
difficult for a car thief to take your car. Lojack 
(a tracking system) makes it easier for the police 
to catch the car thief who has stolen it. Which 
of these types of protection conveys a negative 
externality on other car owners? Which conveys 
a positive externality? Do you think there are 
any policy implications of your analysis?
	 2.	 Do you agree with the following statements? 
Why or why not?
a.	 “The benefits of corrective taxes as a way to 
reduce pollution have to be weighed against 
the deadweight losses that these taxes cause.” 
b.	“When deciding whether to levy a corrective 
tax on consumers or producers, the 
government should be careful to levy the 
tax on the side of the market generating the 
externality.”
	 3.	 Consider the market for fire extinguishers.
a.	 Why might fire extinguishers exhibit positive 
externalities?
b.	Draw a graph of the market for fire 
extinguishers, labeling the demand curve, the 
social-value curve, the supply curve, and the 
social-cost curve.
c.	 Indicate the market equilibrium level of 
output and the efficient level of output. 
Give an intuitive explanation for why these 
quantities differ.
d.	If the external benefit is $10 per extinguisher, 
describe a government policy that would 
yield the efficient outcome.
	 4.	 A local drama company proposes a new 
neighborhood theater in San Francisco. Before 
approving the building permit, the city planner 
completes a study of the theater’s impact on the 
surrounding community.
a.	 One finding of the study is that theaters 
attract traffic, which adversely affects the 
community. The city planner estimates that 
the cost to the community from the extra 
traffic is $5 per ticket. What kind of an 
externality is this? Why?
b.	Graph the market for theater tickets, labeling 
the demand curve, the social-value curve, 
the supply curve, the social-cost curve, the 
market equilibrium level of output, and the 
efficient level of output. Also show the  
per-unit amount of the externality.
c.	 Upon further review, the city planner 
uncovers a second externality. Rehearsals 
for the plays tend to run until late at night, 
with actors, stagehands, and other theater 
members coming and going at various hours. 
The planner has found that the increased 
foot traffic improves the safety of the 
surrounding streets, an estimated benefit to 
the community of $2 per ticket. What kind of 
externality is this? Why?
d.	On a new graph, illustrate the market for 
theater tickets in the case of these two 
externalities. Again, label the demand curve, 
the social-value curve, the supply curve, the 
social-cost curve, the market equilibrium 
level of output, the efficient level of output, 
and the per-unit amount of both externalities.
e.	 Describe a government policy that would 
result in an efficient outcome.
	 5.	 Greater consumption of alcohol leads to more 
motor vehicle accidents and, thus, imposes costs 
on people who do not drink and drive.
a.	 Illustrate the market for alcohol, labeling 
the demand curve, the social-value curve, 
the supply curve, the social-cost curve, the 
market equilibrium level of output, and the 
efficient level of output.
b.	On your graph, shade the area corresponding 
to the deadweight loss of the market 
equilibrium. (Hint: The deadweight loss 
occurs because some units of alcohol are 
consumed for which the social cost exceeds 
the social value.) Explain.
	 6.	 Many observers believe that the levels of 
pollution in our society are too high.
a.	 If society wishes to reduce overall pollution 
by a certain amount, why is it efficient to 
have different amounts of reduction at 
different firms?
b.	Command-and-control approaches often rely 
on uniform reductions among firms. Why 
are these approaches generally unable to 
target the firms that should undertake bigger 
reductions?
c.	 Economists argue that appropriate corrective 
taxes or tradable pollution rights will result

CHAPTER 10   Externalities
in efficient pollution reduction. How do 
these approaches target the firms that should 
undertake bigger reductions?
	 7.	 The many identical residents of Whoville love 
drinking Zlurp. Each resident has the following 
willingness to pay for the tasty refreshment:
First bottle 	
$5
Second bottle	
4
Third bottle	
3
Fourth bottle	
2
Fifth bottle 	
1
Further bottles	
0
a.	 The cost of producing Zlurp is $1.50, and 
the competitive suppliers sell it at this price.
(The supply curve is horizontal.) How many 
bottles will each Whovillian consume? What 
is each person’s consumer surplus?
b.	Producing Zlurp creates pollution. Each 
bottle has an external cost of $1. Taking this 
additional cost into account, what is total 
surplus per person in the allocation you 
described in part (a)?
c.	 Cindy Lou Who, one of the residents of 
Whoville, decides on her own to reduce her 
consumption of Zlurp by one bottle. What 
happens to Cindy’s welfare (her consumer 
surplus minus the cost of pollution she 
experiences)? How does Cindy’s decision 
affect total surplus in Whoville?
d.	Mayor Grinch imposes a $1 tax on Zlurp. 
What is consumption per person now? 
Calculate consumer surplus, the external cost, 
government revenue, and total surplus per 
person.
e.	 Based on your calculations, would you 
support the mayor’s policy? Why or why not?
	 8.	 Ringo loves playing rock ‘n’ roll music at  
high volume. Luciano loves opera and hates 
rock ‘n’ roll. Unfortunately, they are next-door 
neighbors in an apartment building with  
paper-thin walls.
a.	 What is the externality here?
b.	What command-and-control policy might the 
landlord impose? Could such a policy lead to 
an inefficient outcome?
c.	 Suppose the landlord lets the tenants do 
whatever they want. According to the Coase 
theorem, how might Ringo and Luciano 
reach an efficient outcome on their own? 
What might prevent them from reaching an 
efficient outcome?
	 9.	 Figure 4 shows that for any given demand 
curve for the right to pollute, the government 
can achieve the same outcome either by setting 
a price with a corrective tax or by setting a 
quantity with pollution permits. Suppose there 
is a sharp improvement in the technology for 
controlling pollution.
a.	 Using graphs similar to those in Figure 4, 
illustrate the effect of this development on 
the demand for pollution rights.
b.	What is the effect on the price and quantity 
of pollution under each regulatory system? 
Explain.
	10.	 Suppose that the government decides to issue 
tradable permits for a certain form of pollution.
a.	 Does it matter for economic efficiency 
whether the government distributes or 
auctions the permits? Why or why not?
b.	If the government chooses to distribute the 
permits, does the allocation of permits among 
firms matter for efficiency? Explain.
	11.	 There are three industrial firms in Happy Valley.
	
Initial	
Cost of Reducing  
Firm	
Pollution Level 	
Pollution by 1 Unit
A	
70 units	
$20
B	
80 units	
$25
C	
50 units	
$10
The government wants to reduce pollution to 
120 units, so it gives each firm 40 tradable 
pollution permits.
a.	 Who sells permits and how many do they 
sell? Who buys permits and how many do 
they buy? Briefly explain why the sellers 
and buyers are each willing to do so. What 
is the total cost of pollution reduction in this 
situation?
b.	How much higher would the costs of 
pollution reduction be if the permits could 
not be traded?
