Public Goods and 
    Common Resources 
A
n old song lyric maintains that “the best things in life are free.” A 
moment’s thought reveals a long list of goods that the songwriter could 
have had in mind. Nature provides some of them, such as rivers, moun-
tains, beaches, lakes, and oceans. The government provides others, such 
as playgrounds, parks, and parades. In each case, people do not pay a fee when 
they choose to enjoy the benefit of the good.
Goods without prices provide a special challenge for economic analysis. Most 
goods in our economy are allocated in markets, in which buyers pay for what they 
receive and sellers are paid for what they provide. For these goods, prices are the 
signals that guide the decisions of buyers and sellers, and these decisions lead 
to an efficient allocation of resources. When goods are available free of charge, 
however, the market forces that normally allocate resources in our economy are 
absent.

The Economics of the Public Sector
In this chapter, we examine the problems that arise for the allocation of 
resources when there are goods without market prices. Our analysis will shed 
light on one of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1: Governments can 
sometimes improve market outcomes. When a good does not have a price 
attached to it, private markets cannot ensure that the good is produced and con-
sumed in the proper amounts. In such cases, government policy can potentially 
remedy the market failure and raise economic well-being.
The Different Kinds of Goods
How well do markets work in providing the goods that people want? The answer 
to this question depends on the good being considered. As we discussed in 
Chapter 7, a market can provide the efficient number of ice-cream cones: The price 
of ice-cream cones adjusts to balance supply and demand, and this equilibrium 
maximizes the sum of producer and consumer surplus. Yet as we discussed in 
Chapter 10, the market cannot be counted on to prevent aluminum manufactur-
ers from polluting the air we breathe: Buyers and sellers in a market typically do 
not take into account the external effects of their decisions. Thus, markets work 
well when the good is ice cream, but they work badly when the good is clean air. 
In thinking about the various goods in the economy, it is useful to group them 
according to two characteristics:
• 	 Is the good excludable? That is, can people be prevented from using the good? 
• 	 Is the good rival in consumption? That is, does one person’s use of the good 
reduce another person’s ability to use it?
Using these two characteristics, Figure 1 divides goods into four categories: 
	 1.	 Private goods are both excludable and rival in consumption. Consider an 
ice-cream cone, for example. An ice-cream cone is excludable because it is 
possible to prevent someone from eating an ice-cream cone—you just don’t 
give it to him. An ice-cream cone is rival in consumption because if one 
­person eats an ice-cream cone, another person cannot eat the same cone. 
Most goods in the economy are private goods like ice-cream cones: You 
don’t get one unless you pay for it, and once you have it, you are the only 
person who benefits. When we analyzed supply and demand in Chapters 4, 
5, and 6 and the efficiency of markets in Chapters 7, 8, and 9, we implicitly 
assumed that goods were both excludable and rival in consumption. 
	 2.	 Public goods are neither excludable nor rival in consumption. That is, ­people 
cannot be prevented from using a public good, and one person’s use of a 
public good does not reduce another person’s ability to use it. For ­example,  
a tornado siren in a small town is a public good. Once the siren sounds,  
it is impossible to prevent any single person from hearing it (so it is not 
excludable). Moreover, when one person gets the benefit of the warning, she 
does not reduce the benefit to anyone else (so it is not rival in consumption).
	 3.	 Common resources are rival in consumption but not excludable. For 
­example, fish in the ocean are rival in consumption: When one person 
catches fish, there are fewer fish for the next person to catch. Yet these fish 
are not an excludable good because, given the vast size of an ocean, it is 
­difficult to stop fishermen from taking fish out of it.

CHAPTER 11    Public Goods and Common Resources
	 4.	 Club goods are excludable but not rival in consumption. For instance, 
­consider fire protection in a small town. It is easy to exclude someone from 
using this good: The fire department can just let his house burn down. Yet 
fire protection is not rival in consumption: Once a town has paid for the fire 
department, the additional cost of protecting one more house is small. (We 
discuss club goods again in Chapter     , where we see that they are one type 
of a natural monopoly.)
Although Figure 1 offers a clean separation of goods into four categories, the 
boundaries between the categories are sometimes fuzzy. Whether goods are 
excludable or rival in consumption is often a matter of degree. Fish in an ocean may 
not be excludable because monitoring fishing is so difficult, but a large enough 
coast guard could make fish at least partly excludable. Similarly, although fish are 
generally rival in consumption, this would be less true if the population of fisher-
men were small relative to the population of fish. (Think of North American fish-
ing waters before the arrival of European settlers.) For purposes of our analysis, 
however, it will be helpful to group goods into these four categories.
In this chapter, we examine goods that are not excludable: public goods and 
common resources. Because people cannot be prevented from using these goods, 
they are available to everyone free of charge. The study of public goods and 
common resources is closely related to the study of externalities. For both of 
these types of goods, externalities arise because something of value has no price 
attached to it. If one person were to provide a public good, such as a tornado 
siren, other people would be better off. They would receive a benefit without 
paying for it—a positive externality. Similarly, when one person uses a common 
resource such as the fish in the ocean, other people are worse off because there are 
fewer fish to catch. They suffer a loss but are not compensated for it—a negative 
externality. Because of these external effects, private decisions about consumption 
and production can lead to an inefficient allocation of resources, and government 
intervention can potentially raise economic well-being.

Four Types of Goods
Goods can be grouped into four 
categories according to two 
characteristics: (1) A good is 
excludable if people can be prevented 
from using it. (2) A good is rival in 
consumption if one person’s use of 
the good diminishes other people’s 
use of it. This diagram gives examples

Public Goods
To understand how public goods differ from other goods and why they present 
problems for society, let’s consider an example: a fireworks display. This good is 
not excludable because it is impossible to prevent someone from seeing fireworks, 
and it is not rival in consumption because one person’s enjoyment of fireworks 
does not reduce anyone else’s enjoyment of them. 
The Free-Rider Problem
The citizens of Smalltown, U.S.A., like seeing fireworks on the Fourth of July. 
Each of the town’s 500 residents places a $10 value on the experience for a total 
benefit of $5,000. The cost of putting on a fireworks display is $1,000. Because the 
$5,000 benefit exceeds the $1,000 cost, it is efficient for Smalltown to have a fire-
works display on the Fourth of July.
Would the private market produce the efficient outcome? Probably not. 
Imagine that Ellen, a Smalltown entrepreneur, decided to put on a fireworks 
display. Ellen would surely have trouble selling tickets to the event because her 
potential customers would quickly figure out that they could see the fireworks 
even without a ticket. Because fireworks are not excludable, people have an incen-
tive to be free riders. A free rider is a person who receives the benefit of a good 
but does not pay for it. Because people would have an incentive to be free riders 
rather than ticket buyers, the market would fail to provide the efficient outcome.
One way to view this market failure is that it arises because of an externality. 
If Ellen puts on the fireworks display, she confers an external benefit on those 
who see the display without paying for it. When deciding whether to put on the 
display, however, Ellen does not take the external benefits into account. Even 
though the fireworks display is socially desirable, it is not profitable. As a result, 
Ellen makes the privately rational but socially inefficient decision not to put on 
the display.
Although the private market fails to supply the fireworks display demanded 
by Smalltown residents, the solution to Smalltown’s problem is obvious: The 
local government can sponsor a Fourth of July celebration. The town council can 
raise everyone’s taxes by $2 and use the revenue to hire Ellen to produce the 
fireworks. Everyone in Smalltown is better off by $8—the $10 at which residents 
value the fireworks minus the $2 tax bill. Ellen can help Smalltown reach the effi-
cient outcome as a public employee even though she could not do so as a private 
entrepreneur.
The story of Smalltown is simplified but realistic. In fact, many local govern-
ments in the United States pay for fireworks on the Fourth of July. Moreover, 
the story shows a general lesson about public goods: Because public goods are 
not excludable, the free-rider problem prevents the private market from sup-
plying them. The government, however, can potentially remedy the problem. If 
the government decides that the total benefits of a public good exceed its costs, 
it can provide the public good, pay for it with tax revenue, and make everyone 
better off.
Some Important Public Goods
There are many examples of public goods. Here we consider three of the most 
important.

CHAPTER 11    Public Goods and Common Resources
National Defense  The defense of a country from foreign aggressors is a clas-
sic example of a public good. Once the country is defended, it is impossible to 
prevent any single person from enjoying the benefit of this defense. Moreover, 
when one person enjoys the benefit of national defense, he does not reduce the 
benefit to anyone else. Thus, national defense is neither excludable nor rival in 
consumption.
National defense is also one of the most expensive public goods. In 2009, the 
U.S. federal government spent a total of $661 billion on national defense, more 
than $2,150 per person. People disagree about whether this amount is too small or 
too large, but almost no one doubts that some government spending for national 
defense is necessary. Even economists who advocate small government agree that 
the national defense is a public good the government should provide.
Basic Research  Knowledge is created through research. In evaluating the 
appropriate public policy toward knowledge creation, it is important to distin-
guish general knowledge from specific technological knowledge. Specific tech-
nological knowledge, such as the invention of a longer-lasting battery, a smaller 
microchip, or a better digital music player, can be patented. The patent gives the 
inventor the exclusive right to the knowledge he or she has created for a period 
of time. Anyone else who wants to use the patented information must pay the 
inventor for the right to do so. In other words, the patent makes the knowledge 
created by the inventor excludable. 
By contrast, general knowledge is a public good. For example, a mathematician 
cannot patent a theorem. Once a theorem is proven, the knowledge is not exclud-
able: The theorem enters society’s general pool of knowledge that anyone can use 
without charge. The theorem is also not rival in consumption: One person’s use of 
the theorem does not prevent any other person from using the theorem.
Profit-seeking firms spend a lot on research trying to develop new products 
that they can patent and sell, but they do not spend much on basic research. Their 
incentive, instead, is to free ride on the general knowledge created by others. As a 
result, in the absence of any public policy, society would devote too few resources 
to creating new knowledge.
The government tries to provide the public good of general knowledge in vari-
ous ways. Government agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health and the 
National Science Foundation, subsidize basic research in medicine, mathematics, 
physics, chemistry, biology, and even economics. Some people justify govern-
ment funding of the space program on the grounds that it adds to society’s pool 
of knowledge (although many scientists are skeptical of the scientific value of 
manned space travel). Determining the appropriate level of government sup-
port for these endeavors is difficult because the benefits are hard to measure. 
Moreover, the members of Congress who appropriate funds for research usually 
have little expertise in science and, therefore, are not in the best position to judge 
what lines of research will produce the largest benefits. So, while basic research is 
surely a public good, we should not be surprised if the public sector fails to pay 
for the right amount and the right kinds.
Fighting Poverty  Many government programs are aimed at helping the 
poor. The welfare system (officially called the Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families program) provides a small income for some poor families. Similarly, the 
Food Stamp program subsidizes the purchase of food for those with low incomes, 
“I like the concept if we can 
do it with no new taxes.”

and various government housing programs make shelter more affordable. These 
antipoverty programs are financed by taxes paid by families that are financially 
more successful.
Economists disagree among themselves about what role the government 
should play in fighting poverty. We discuss this debate more fully in Chapter 20, 
but here we note one important argument: Advocates of antipoverty programs 
claim that fighting poverty is a public good. Even if everyone prefers living in a 
society without poverty, fighting poverty is not a “good” that private actions will 
adequately provide. 
To see why, suppose someone tried to organize a group of wealthy individuals 
to try to eliminate poverty. They would be providing a public good. This good 
would not be rival in consumption: One person’s enjoyment of living in a society 
without poverty would not reduce anyone else’s enjoyment of it. The good would 
not be excludable: Once poverty is eliminated, no one can be prevented from 
taking pleasure in this fact. As a result, there would be a tendency for people to 
free ride on the generosity of others, enjoying the benefits of poverty elimination 
without contributing to the cause.
Because of the free-rider problem, eliminating poverty through private charity 
will probably not work. Yet government action can solve this problem. Taxing the 
wealthy to raise the living standards of the poor can potentially make everyone 
better off. The poor are better off because they now enjoy a higher standard of liv-
ing, and those paying the taxes are better off because they enjoy living in a society 
with less poverty.
Are Lighthouses Public Goods?
Some goods can switch between being public goods and being private goods 
depending on the circumstances. For example, a fireworks display is a public 
good if performed in a town with many residents. Yet if performed at a private 
amusement park, such as Walt Disney World, a fireworks display is more like a 
private good because visitors to the park pay for admission.
	
Another example is a lighthouse. Economists have long used lighthouses as an 
example of a public good. Lighthouses mark specific locations along the coast so 
that passing ships can avoid treacherous waters. The benefit that the lighthouse 
provides to the ship captain is neither excludable nor rival in consumption, so 
each captain has an incentive to free ride by using the lighthouse to navigate 
without paying for the service. Because of this free-rider problem, private markets 
usually fail to provide the lighthouses that ship captains need. As a result, most 
lighthouses today are operated by the government.
	
In some cases, however, lighthouses have been closer to private goods. On 
the coast of England in the 19th century, for example, some lighthouses were 
privately owned and operated. Instead of trying to charge ship captains for the 
service, however, the owner of the lighthouse charged the owner of the nearby 
port. If the port owner did not pay, the lighthouse owner turned off the light, and 
ships avoided that port. 
	
In deciding whether something is a public good, one must determine who the 
beneficiaries are and whether these beneficiaries can be excluded from using the 
good. A free-rider problem arises when the number of beneficiaries is large and 
exclusion of any one of them is impossible. If a lighthouse benefits many ship

captains, it is a public good. Yet if it primarily benefits a single port owner, it is 
more like a private good.  ■
The Difficult Job of Cost–Benefit Analysis 
So far we have seen that the government provides public goods because the pri-
vate market on its own will not produce an efficient quantity. Yet deciding that 
the government must play a role is only the first step. The government must then 
determine what kinds of public goods to provide and in what quantities. 
Suppose that the government is considering a public project, such as building a 
new highway. To judge whether to build the highway, it must compare the total 
benefits of all those who would use it to the costs of building and maintaining 
it. To make this decision, the government might hire a team of economists and 
engineers to conduct a study, called a cost–benefit analysis, to estimate the total 
costs and benefits of the project to society as a whole. 
Cost–benefit analysts have a tough job. Because the highway will be avail-
able to everyone free of charge, there is no price with which to judge the 
value of the highway. Simply asking people how much they would value the 
highway is not reliable: Quantifying benefits is difficult using the results from 
a questionnaire, and respondents have little incentive to tell the truth. Those 
who would use the highway have an incentive to exaggerate the benefit they 
receive to get the highway built. Those who would be harmed by the highway 
have an incentive to exaggerate the costs to them to prevent the highway from 
being built.
The efficient provision of public goods is, therefore, intrinsically more difficult 
than the efficient provision of private goods. When buyers of a private good enter 
a market, they reveal the value they place on it through the prices they are willing 
to pay. At the same time, sellers reveal their costs with the prices they are willing 
to accept. The equilibrium is an efficient allocation of resources because it reflects 
all this information. By contrast, cost–benefit analysts do not have any price sig-
nals to observe when evaluating whether the government should provide a public 
good and how much to provide. Their findings on the costs and benefits of public 
projects are rough approximations at best.
How Much Is a Life Worth?
Imagine that you have been elected to serve as a member of your local town 
council. The town engineer comes to you with a proposal: The town can spend 
$10,000 to build and operate a traffic light at a town intersection that now has only 
a stop sign. The benefit of the traffic light is increased safety. The engineer esti-
mates, based on data from similar intersections, that the traffic light would reduce 
the risk of a fatal traffic accident over the lifetime of the traffic light from 1.6 to 
1.1 percent. Should you spend the money for the new light?
	
To answer this question, you turn to cost–benefit analysis. But you quickly 
run into an obstacle: The costs and benefits must be measured in the same units 
if you are to compare them meaningfully. The cost is measured in dollars, but 
the benefit—the possibility of saving a person’s life—is not directly monetary. To 
make your decision, you have to put a dollar value on a human life.

At first, you may be tempted to conclude that a human life is priceless. After all, 
there is probably no amount of money that you could be paid to voluntarily give 
up your life or that of a loved one. This suggests that a human life has an infinite 
dollar value. 
	
For the purposes of cost–benefit analysis, however, this answer leads to non-
sensical results. If we truly placed an infinite value on human life, we should place 
traffic lights on every street corner, and we should all drive large cars loaded with 
all the latest safety features. Yet traffic lights are not at every corner, and people 
sometimes choose to pay less for smaller cars without safety options such as side-
impact air bags or antilock brakes. In both our public and private decisions, we 
are at times willing to risk our lives to save some money. 
	
Once we have accepted the idea that a person’s life has an implicit dollar value, 
how can we determine what that value is? One approach, sometimes used by 
courts to award damages in wrongful-death suits, is to look at the total amount of 
money a person would have earned if he or she had lived. Economists are often 
critical of this approach because it ignores other opportunity costs of losing one’s 
life. It thus has the bizarre implication that the life of a retired or disabled person 
has no value.
	
A better way to value human life is to look at the risks that people are volun-
tarily willing to take and how much they must be paid for taking them. Mortality 
risk varies across jobs, for example. Construction workers in high-rise buildings 
face greater risk of death on the job than office workers do. By comparing wages 
in risky and less risky occupations, controlling for education, experience, and 
other determinants of wages, economists can get some sense about what value 
people put on their own lives. Studies using this approach conclude that the value 
of a human life is about $10 million.
	
We can now return to our original example and respond to the town engineer. 
The traffic light reduces the risk of fatality by 0.5 percentage points. Thus, the 
expected benefit from installing the traffic light is 0.005 × $10 million, or $50,000. 
This estimate of the benefit well exceeds the cost of $10,000, so you should 
approve the project.  ■

Common Resources
Common resources, like public goods, are not excludable: They are available free 
of charge to anyone who wants to use them. Common resources are, however, 
rival in consumption: One person’s use of the common resource reduces other 
people’s ability to use it. Thus, common resources give rise to a new problem. 
Once the good is provided, policymakers need to be concerned about how much 
it is used. This problem is best understood from the classic parable called the 
Tragedy of the Commons.
The Tragedy of the Commons

place in the town, one of the most important is raising sheep. Many of the town’s

CHAPTER 11    Public Goods and Common Resources
families own flocks of sheep and support themselves by selling the sheep’s wool, 
which is used to make clothing.
As our story begins, the sheep spend much of their time grazing on the land 
surrounding the town, called the Town Common. No family owns the land. 
Instead, the town residents own the land collectively, and all the residents are 
allowed to graze their sheep on it. Collective ownership works well because land 
is plentiful. As long as everyone can get all the good grazing land they want, the 
Town Common is not rival in consumption, and allowing residents’ sheep to 
graze for free causes no problems. Everyone in the town is happy. 
As the years pass, the population of the town grows, and so does the number 
of sheep grazing on the Town Common. With a growing number of sheep 
and a fixed amount of land, the land starts to lose its ability to replenish itself. 
Eventually, the land is grazed so heavily that it becomes barren. With no grass left 
on the Town Common, raising sheep is impossible, and the town’s once prosper-
ous wool industry disappears. Many families lose their source of livelihood.
What causes the tragedy? Why do the shepherds allow the sheep population 
to grow so large that it destroys the Town Common? The reason is that social and 
private incentives differ. Avoiding the destruction of the grazing land depends on 
the collective action of the shepherds. If the shepherds acted together, they could 
reduce the sheep population to a size that the Town Common can support. Yet 
no single family has an incentive to reduce the size of its own flock because each 
flock represents only a small part of the problem.
In essence, the Tragedy of the Commons arises because of an externality. When 
one family’s flock grazes on the common land, it reduces the quality of the land 
available for other families. Because people neglect this negative externality when 
deciding how many sheep to own, the result is an excessive number of sheep. 
If the tragedy had been foreseen, the town could have solved the problem in 
various ways. It could have regulated the number of sheep in each family’s flock, 
internalized the externality by taxing sheep, or auctioned off a limited number 
of sheep-grazing permits. That is, the medieval town could have dealt with the 
problem of overgrazing in the way that modern society deals with the problem 
of pollution. 
In the case of land, however, there is a simpler solution. The town can divide 
the land among town families. Each family can enclose its parcel of land with a 
fence and then protect it from excessive grazing. In this way, the land becomes a 
private good rather than a common resource. This outcome in fact occurred dur-
ing the enclosure movement in England in the 17th century. 
The Tragedy of the Commons is a story with a general lesson: When one per-
son uses a common resource, he or she diminishes other people’s enjoyment of 
it. Because of this negative externality, common resources tend to be used exces-
sively. The government can solve the problem by using regulation or taxes to 
reduce consumption of the common resource. Alternatively, the government can 
sometimes turn the common resource into a private good. 
This lesson has been known for thousands of years. The ancient Greek phi-
losopher Aristotle pointed out the problem with common resources: “What is 
common to many is taken least care of, for all men have greater regard for what is 
their own than for what they possess in common with others.” 
Some Important Common Resources
There are many examples of common resources. In almost all cases, the same 
problem arises as in the Tragedy of the Commons: Private decision makers use

the common resource too much. Governments often regulate behavior or impose 
fees to mitigate the problem of overuse.
Clean Air and Water  As we discussed in Chapter 10, markets do not ade-
quately protect the environment. Pollution is a negative externality that can be 
remedied with regulations or with corrective taxes on polluting activities. One can 
view this market failure as an example of a common-resource problem. Clean air 
and clean water are common resources like open grazing land, and excessive pol-
lution is like excessive grazing. Environmental degradation is a modern Tragedy 
of the Commons.
Why You’ll Love 
Paying for Roads That 
Used to Be Free
By Eric A. Morris
T
o end the scourge of traffic congestion, 
Julius Caesar banned most carts from 
the streets of Rome during daylight hours. 
It didn’t work—traffic jams just shifted to 
dusk. Two thousand years later, we have 
put a man on the moon and developed 
garments infinitely more practical than the 
toga, but we seem little nearer to solving 
the congestion problem.
	
If you live in a city, particularly a large 
one, you probably need little convincing that 
traffic congestion is frustrating and waste-
ful. According to the Texas Transportation 
Institute, the average American urban trave-
ler lost 38 hours, nearly one full work week, 
to congestion in 2005. And congestion is 
getting worse, not better; urban travelers in 
1982 were delayed only 14 hours that year. 
	
Americans want action, but unfortunately 
there aren’t too many great ideas about what 
that action might be. As Anthony Downs’s 
excellent book Still Stuck in Traffic: Coping 
With Peak-Hour Traffic Congestion chroni-
cles, most of the proposed solutions are too 
difficult to implement, won’t work, or both. 
	
Fortunately, there is one remedy which 
is both doable and largely guaranteed to 
succeed. In the space of a year or two we 
could have you zipping along the 405 or the 
LIE at the height of rush hour at a comfort-
able 55 miles per hour. 
	
There’s just one small problem with this 
silver bullet for congestion: many people 
seem to prefer the werewolf. Despite its 
merits, this policy, which is known as “con-
gestion pricing,” “value pricing,” or “vari-
able tolling,” is not an easy political sell. 
	
For decades, economists and other 
transportation thinkers have advocated 
imposing tolls that vary with congestion 
levels on roadways. Simply put, the more 
congestion, the higher the toll, until the 
congestion goes away. 
	
To many people, this sounds like a 
scheme by mustache-twirling bureaucrats 
and their academic apologists to fleece 
drivers out of their hard-earned cash. Why 
should drivers have to pay to use roads their 
tax dollars have already paid for? Won’t the 
remaining free roads be swamped as drivers 
are forced off the tolled roads? Won’t the 
working-class and poor be the victims here, 
as the tolled routes turn into “Lexus lanes”? 
	
And besides, adopting this policy would 
mean listening to economists, and who 
wants to do that? 
	
There’s a real problem with this logic, 
which is that, on its own terms, it makes 
perfect sense (except for the listening to 
economists part). Opponents of tolls are 
certainly not stupid, and their arguments 
deserve serious consideration. But in the 
end, their concerns are largely overblown, 
and the benefits of tolling swamp the poten-
tial costs. 
	
Unfortunately, it can be hard to convey 
this because the theory behind tolling is 
somewhat complex and counterintuitive. 
 The Case for Toll Roads
Many economists think drivers should be charged more for using roads. 
Here is why.

CHAPTER 11    Public Goods and Common Resources
Congested Roads  Roads can be either public goods or common resources. If 
a road is not congested, then one person’s use does not affect anyone else. In this 
case, use is not rival in consumption, and the road is a public good. Yet if a road 
is congested, then use of that road yields a negative externality. When one person 
drives on the road, it becomes more crowded, and other people must drive more 
slowly. In this case, the road is a common resource.
One way for the government to address the problem of road congestion is to 
charge drivers a toll. A toll is, in essence, a corrective tax on the externality of con-
gestion. Sometimes, as in the case of local roads, tolls are not a practical solution 
This is too bad, because variable tolling is 
an excellent public policy. Here’s why: the 
basic economic theory is that when you give 
out something valuable—in this case, road 
space—for less than its true value, short-
ages result. 
	
Ultimately, there’s no free lunch; instead 
of paying with money, you pay with the 
effort and time needed to acquire the good. 
Think of Soviet shoppers spending their lives 
in endless queues to purchase artificially low-
priced but exceedingly scarce goods. Then 
think of Americans who can fulfill nearly any 
consumerist fantasy quickly but at a mon-
etary cost. Free but congested roads have 
left us shivering on the streets of Moscow.
	
To consider it another way, delay is 
an externality imposed by drivers on their 
peers. By driving onto a busy road and 
contributing to congestion, drivers slow the 
speeds of others—but they never have to 
pay for it, at least not directly. In the end, 
of course, everybody pays, because as we 
impose congestion on others, others impose 
it on us. This degenerates into a game that 
nobody can win.
	
Markets work best when externalities 
are internalized: i.e., you pay for the hassle 
you inflict on others. … Using tolls to help 
internalize the congestion externality would 
somewhat reduce the number of trips made 
on the most congested roads at the peak 
usage periods; some trips would be moved 
to less congested times and routes, and oth-
ers would be foregone entirely. This way we 
would cut down on the congestion costs we 
impose on each other. 
	
Granted, tolls cannot fully cope with 
accidents and other incidents, which are 
major causes of delay. But pricing can 
largely eliminate chronic, recurring conges-
tion. No matter how high the demand for a 
road, there is a level of toll that will keep it 
flowing freely. 
	
To make tolling truly effective, the price 
must be right. Too high a price drives away 
too many cars and the road does not func-
tion at its capacity. Too low a price and 
congestion isn’t licked. 
	
The best solution is to vary the tolls in 
real time based on an analysis of current 
traffic conditions. Pilot toll projects on roads 
(like the I-394 in Minnesota and the I-15 in 
Southern California) use sensors embedded 
in the pavement to monitor the number and 
speeds of vehicles on the facility. 
	
A simple computer program then deter-
mines the number of cars that should be 
allowed in. The computer then calculates 
the level of toll that will attract that number 
of cars—and no more. Prices are then 
updated every few minutes on electronic 
message signs. Hi-tech transponders and 
antenna arrays make waiting at toll booths 
a thing of the past. 
	
The bottom line is that speeds are kept 
high (over 45 m.p.h.) so that throughput is 
higher than when vehicles are allowed to 
crowd all at once onto roadways at rush 
hour, slowing traffic to a crawl. 
	
To maximize efficiency, economists 
would like to price all travel, starting 
with the freeways. But given that elected 
officials have no burning desire to lose 
their jobs, a more realistic option, for 
now, is to toll just some freeway lanes 
that are either new capacity or underused 
carpool lanes. The other lanes would be 
left free—and congested. Drivers will 
then have a choice: wait or pay. Granted, 
neither is ideal. But right now drivers have 
no choice at all.
	
What’s the bottom line here? The state 
of Washington recently opened congestion-
priced lanes on its State Route 167. The 
peak toll in the first month of operation 
(reached on the evening of Wednesday, 
May 21) was $5.75. I know, I know, you 
would never pay such an exorbitant amount 
when America has taught you that free 
roads are your birthright. But that money 
bought Washington drivers a 27-minute 
time savings. Is a half hour of your time 
worth $6?
	
I think I already know the answer, and it 
is “it depends.” Most people’s value of time 
varies widely depending on their activities 
on any given day. Late for picking the kids 
up from daycare? Paying $6 to save a half 
hour is an incredible bargain. Have to clean 
the house? The longer your trip home takes, 
the better. Tolling will introduce a new level 
of flexibility and freedom into your life, giv-
ing you the power to tailor your travel costs 
to fit your schedule.

because the cost of collecting them is too high. But several major cities, including 
London and Stockholm, have found increasing tolls to be a very effective way to 
reduce congestion.
Sometimes congestion is a problem only at certain times of day. If a bridge 
is heavily traveled only during rush hour, for instance, the congestion exter-
nality is largest during this time. The efficient way to deal with these exter-
nalities is to charge higher tolls during rush hour. This toll would provide an 
incentive for drivers to alter their schedules, reducing traffic when congestion 
is greatest.
Another policy that responds to the problem of road congestion, discussed in 
a case study in the previous chapter, is the tax on gasoline. Gasoline is a comple-
mentary good to driving: An increase in the price of gasoline tends to reduce the 
quantity of driving demanded. Therefore, a gasoline tax reduces road congestion. 
A gasoline tax, however, is an imperfect solution, because it affects other decisions 
besides the amount of driving on congested roads. For example, the gasoline tax 
discourages driving on uncongested roads, even though there is no congestion 
externality for these roads. 
Fish, Whales, and Other Wildlife  Many species of animals are common 
resources. Fish and whales, for instance, have commercial value, and anyone can 
go to the ocean and catch whatever is available. Each person has little incentive 
to maintain the species for the next year. Just as excessive grazing can destroy the 
Town Common, excessive fishing and whaling can destroy commercially valu-
able marine populations. 
Oceans remain one of the least regulated common resources. Two problems 
prevent an easy solution. First, many countries have access to the oceans, so any 
solution would require international cooperation among countries that hold dif-
ferent values. Second, because the oceans are so vast, enforcing any agreement is 
difficult. As a result, fishing rights have been a frequent source of international 
tension among normally friendly countries.
Within the United States, various laws aim to manage the use of fish and other 
wildlife. For example, the government charges for fishing and hunting licenses, 
and it restricts the lengths of the fishing and hunting seasons. Fishermen are often 
required to throw back small fish, and hunters can kill only a limited number of 
animals. All these laws reduce the use of a common resource and help maintain 
animal populations.
Why the Cow Is Not Extinct 
Throughout history, many species of animals have been threatened with extinc-
tion. When Europeans first arrived in North America, more than 60 million buf-
falo roamed the continent. Yet hunting the buffalo was so popular during the 19th 
century that by 1900 the animal’s population had fallen to about 400 before the 
government stepped in to protect the species. In some African countries today, 
the elephant faces a similar challenge, as poachers kill the animals for the ivory 
in their tusks.
	
Yet not all animals with commercial value face this threat. The cow, for exam-
ple, is a valuable source of food, but no one worries that the cow will soon be

extinct. Indeed, the great demand for beef seems to ensure that the species will 
continue to thrive.
	
Why does the commercial value of ivory threaten the elephant, while the com-
mercial value of beef protects the cow? The reason is that elephants are a common 
resource, whereas cows are a private good. Elephants roam freely without any 
owners. Each poacher has a strong incentive to kill as many elephants as he can 
find. Because poachers are numerous, each poacher has only a slight incentive to 
preserve the elephant population. By contrast, cattle live on ranches that are pri-
vately owned. Each rancher makes great effort to maintain the cattle population 
on his ranch because he reaps the benefit of these efforts.
	
Governments have tried to solve the elephant’s problem in two ways. Some 
countries, such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, have made it illegal to kill 
elephants and sell their ivory. Yet these laws have been hard to enforce, and ele-
phant populations have continued to dwindle. By contrast, other countries, such 
as Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, have made elephants a private 
good by allowing people to kill elephants, but only those on their own property. 
Landowners now have an incentive to preserve the species on their own land, and 
as a result, elephant populations have started to rise. With private ownership and 
the profit motive now on its side, the African elephant might someday be as safe 
from extinction as the cow.  ■
Quick Quiz  Why do governments try to limit the use of common resources?
Conclusion: The Importance of Property Rights
In this and the previous chapter, we have seen there are some “goods” that 
the market does not provide adequately. Markets do not ensure that the air we 
breathe is clean or that our country is defended from foreign aggressors. Instead, 
societies rely on the government to protect the environment and to provide for 
the national defense.
The problems we considered in these chapters arise in many different markets, 
but they share a common theme. In all cases, the market fails to allocate resources 
efficiently because property rights are not well established. That is, some item of 
value does not have an owner with the legal authority to control it. For example, 
although no one doubts that the “good” of clean air or national defense is valu-
able, no one has the right to attach a price to it and profit from its use. A factory 
pollutes too much because no one charges the factory for the pollution it emits. 
The market does not provide for national defense because no one can charge those 
who are defended for the benefit they receive.
When the absence of property rights causes a market failure, the government 
can potentially solve the problem. Sometimes, as in the sale of pollution permits, 
the solution is for the government to help define property rights and thereby 
unleash market forces. Other times, as in restricted hunting seasons, the solution 
is for the government to regulate private behavior. Still other times, as in the pro-
vision of national defense, the solution is for the government to use tax revenue 
to supply a good that the market fails to supply. In all cases, if the policy is well 
planned and well run, it can make the allocation of resources more efficient and 
thus raise economic well-being.

Summary 
• Goods differ in whether they are excludable and 
whether they are rival in consumption. A good 
is excludable if it is possible to prevent someone 
from using it. A good is rival in consumption 
if one person’s use of the good reduces others’ 
ability to use the same unit of the good. Markets 
work best for private goods, which are both 
excludable and rival in consumption. Markets do 
not work as well for other types of goods.
• Public goods are neither rival in consumption nor 
excludable. Examples of public goods include fire-
works displays, national defense, and the creation 
of fundamental knowledge. Because people are 
not charged for their use of the public good, they 
have an incentive to free ride when the good is 
provided privately. Therefore, governments pro-
vide public goods, making their decision about 
the quantity of each good based on cost–benefit 
analysis.
• Common resources are rival in consumption but 
not excludable. Examples include common graz-
ing land, clean air, and congested roads. Because 
people are not charged for their use of common 
resources, they tend to use them excessively. 
Therefore, governments use various methods to 
limit the use of common resources.

only activity is producing and consuming fish. 
They produce fish in two ways. Each person 
who works on a fish farm raises 2 fish per 
day. Each person who goes fishing in the town 
lake catches X fish per day. X depends on N, 
the number of residents fishing in the lake. In 
particular,
X = 6 – N.

more fish.
a.	 Why do you suppose that X, the productivity 
of each fisherman, falls as N, the number of 
fishermen, rises? What economic term would 
you use to describe the fish in the town lake? 
Would the same description apply to the fish 
from the farms? Explain.
b.	The town’s Freedom Party thinks every 
individual should have the right to choose 
between fishing in the lake and farming 
without government interference. Under its 
policy, how many of the residents would fish 
in the lake and how many would work on 
fish farms? How many fish are produced?

c.	 The town’s Efficiency Party thinks Wiknam 
should produce as many fish as it can. To 
achieve this goal, how many of the residents 
should fish in the lake and how many should 
work on the farms? (Hint: Create a table that 
shows the number of fish produced—on 
farms, from the lake, and in total—for each N 
from 0 to 5.)
d.	The Efficiency Party proposes achieving its 
goal by taxing each person fishing in the lake 
by an amount equal to T fish per day. It will 
then distribute the proceeds equally among 
all Wiknam residents. (Fish are assumed to 
be divisible, so these rebates need not be 
whole numbers.) Calculate the value of T 
that would yield the outcome you derived in

off policy, who benefits and who loses from 
the imposition of the Efficiency Party’s 
fishing tax?

Washington, D.C., Metro (subway), charge 
higher fares during rush hours than during the 
rest of the day. Why might they do this?
	10.	 The federal government tests the safety of 
car models and provides the test results free 
of charge to the public. Do you think this 
information qualifies as a public good? Why or 
why not?
	11.	 High-income people are willing to pay more 
than lower-income people to avoid the risk 
of death. For example, they are more likely to 
pay for safety features on cars. Do you think 
cost–benefit analysts should take this fact 
into account when evaluating public projects? 
Consider, for instance, a rich town and a 
poor town, both of which are considering the 
installation of a traffic light. Should the rich 
town use a higher dollar value for a human life 
in making this decision? Why or why not?
