A Macroeconomic  
    Theory of the 
    Open Economy
O
ver the past three decades, the United States has persistently imported 
more goods and services than it has exported. That is, U.S. net exports 
have been negative. While economists debate whether these trade 
deficits are a problem for the U.S. economy, the nation’s business com-
munity often has a strong opinion. Many business leaders claim that the trade 
deficits reflect unfair competition: Foreign firms are allowed to sell their products 
in U.S. markets, they contend, while foreign governments impede U.S. firms from 
selling U.S. products abroad.
Imagine that you are the president and you want to end these trade deficits. 
What should you do? Should you try to limit imports, perhaps by imposing a 
quota on textiles from China or cars from Japan? Or should you try to influence 
the nation’s trade deficit in some other way?

To understand the factors that determine a country’s trade balance and how 
government policies can affect it, we need a macroeconomic theory that explains 
how an open economy works. The preceding chapter introduced some of the 
key macroeconomic variables that describe an economy’s relationship with 
other economies, including net exports, net capital outflow, and the real and 
nominal exchange rates. This chapter develops a model that identifies the forces 
that determine these variables and shows how these variables are related to one 
another.
To develop this macroeconomic model of an open economy, we build on our 
previous analysis in two ways. First, the model takes the economy’s GDP as given. 
We assume that the economy’s output of goods and services, as measured by real 
GDP, is determined by the supplies of the factors of production and by the available 
production technology that turns these inputs into output. Second, the model takes 
the economy’s price level as given. We assume that the price level adjusts to bring 
the supply and demand for money into balance. In other words, this chapter takes 
as a starting point the lessons learned in previous chapters about the determination 
of the economy’s output and price level.
The goal of the model in this chapter is to highlight the forces that determine 
the economy’s trade balance and exchange rate. In one sense, the model is simple: 
It applies the tools of supply and demand to an open economy. Yet the model 
is also more complicated than others we have seen because it involves look-
ing simultaneously at two related markets: the market for loanable funds and 
the market for foreign-currency exchange. After we develop this model of the 
open economy, we use it to examine how various events and policies affect the 
economy’s trade balance and exchange rate. We will then be able to determine 
the government policies that are most likely to reverse the trade deficits that 
the U.S. economy has experienced over the past three decades.
Supply and Demand for Loanable Funds and for  
Foreign-Currency Exchange
To understand the forces at work in an open economy, we focus on supply and 
demand in two markets. The first is the market for loanable funds, which coor-
dinates the economy’s saving, investment, and flow of loanable funds abroad 
(called the net capital outflow). The second is the market for foreign-currency 
exchange, which coordinates people who want to exchange the domestic currency 
for the currency of other countries. In this section, we discuss supply and demand 
in each of these markets. In the next section, we put these markets together to 
explain the overall equilibrium for an open economy.
The Market for Loanable Funds
When we first analyzed the role of the financial system in Chapter     we made 
the simplifying assumption that the financial system consists of only one mar-
ket, called the market for loanable funds. All savers go to this market to deposit 
their saving, and all borrowers go to this market to get their loans. In this mar-
ket, there is one interest rate, which is both the return to saving and the cost of 
borrowing.

To understand the market for loanable funds in an open economy, the place to 
start is the identity discussed in the preceding chapter:
	
S	
=	
I	
+	
NCO
	
Domestic	
Net capital.
	
Saving	=	
+
	
investment	
outflow
Whenever a nation saves a dollar of its income, it can use that dollar to finance 
the purchase of domestic capital or to finance the purchase of an asset abroad. The 
two sides of this identity represent the two sides of the market for loanable funds. 
The supply of loanable funds comes from national saving (S), and the demand for 
loanable funds comes from domestic investment (I) and net capital outflow (NCO). 
Loanable funds should be interpreted as the domestically generated flow of 
resources available for capital accumulation. The purchase of a capital asset adds 
to the demand for loanable funds, regardless of whether that asset is located at 
home (I) or abroad (NCO). Because net capital outflow can be either positive or 
negative, it can either add to or subtract from the demand for loanable funds that 
arises from domestic investment. When NCO . 0, the country is experiencing a 
net outflow of capital; the net purchase of capital overseas adds to the demand for 
domestically generated loanable funds. When NCO , 0, the country is experienc-
ing a net inflow of capital; the capital resources coming from abroad reduce the 
demand for domestically generated loanable funds. 
As we learned in our earlier discussion of the market for loanable funds, the 
quantity of loanable funds supplied and the quantity of loanable funds demanded 
depend on the real interest rate. A higher real interest rate encourages people 
to save and, therefore, raises the quantity of loanable funds supplied. A higher 
interest rate also makes borrowing to finance capital projects more costly; thus, 
it discourages investment and reduces the quantity of loanable funds demanded.
In addition to influencing national saving and domestic investment, the real 
interest rate in a country affects that country’s net capital outflow. To see why, 
consider two mutual funds—one in the United States and one in Germany—
deciding whether to buy a U.S. government bond or a German government bond. 
The mutual fund manager would make this decision in part by comparing the 
real interest rates in the United States and Germany. When the U.S. real interest 
rate rises, the U.S. bond becomes more attractive to both mutual funds. Thus, an 
increase in the U.S. real interest rate discourages Americans from buying foreign 
assets and encourages foreigners to buy U.S. assets. For both reasons, a high U.S. 
real interest rate reduces U.S. net capital outflow.
We represent the market for loanable funds on the familiar supply-and-
demand diagram in Figure 1. As in our earlier analysis of the financial system, the 
supply curve slopes upward because a higher interest rate increases the quantity 
of loanable funds supplied, and the demand curve slopes downward because a 
higher interest rate decreases the quantity of loanable funds demanded. Unlike 
the situation in our previous discussion, however, the demand side of the market 
now represents the behavior of both domestic investment and net capital outflow. 
That is, in an open economy, the demand for loanable funds comes not only from 
those who want loanable funds to buy domestic capital goods but also from those 
who want loanable funds to buy foreign assets.
The interest rate adjusts to bring the supply and demand for loanable funds 
into balance. If the interest rate were below the equilibrium level, the quantity of 
loanable funds supplied would be less than the quantity demanded. The resulting

shortage of loanable funds would push the interest rate upward. Conversely, if 
the interest rate were above the equilibrium level, the quantity of loanable funds 
supplied would exceed the quantity demanded. The surplus of loanable funds 
would drive the interest rate downward. At the equilibrium interest rate, the 
supply of loanable funds exactly balances the demand. That is, at the equilibrium 
interest rate, the amount that people want to save exactly balances the desired quantities 
of domestic investment and net capital outflow.
The Market for Foreign-Currency Exchange
The second market in our model of the open economy is the market for foreign-
currency exchange. Participants in this market trade U.S. dollars in exchange for 
foreign currencies. To understand the market for foreign-currency exchange, we 
begin with another identity from the last chapter:
	
NCO	
=	
NX
	
Net capital outflow	 =	Net exports.
This identity states that the imbalance between the purchase and sale of capital 
assets abroad (NCO) equals the imbalance between exports and imports of goods 
and services (NX). For example, when the U.S. economy is running a trade sur-
plus (NX . 0), foreigners are buying more U.S. goods and services than Ameri-
cans are buying foreign goods and services. What are Americans doing with the 
foreign currency they are getting from this net sale of goods and services abroad? 
They must be buying foreign assets, so U.S. capital is flowing abroad (NCO. 0). 
Conversely, if the United States is running a trade deficit (NX , 0), Americans 
are spending more on foreign goods and services than they are earning from sell-
ing abroad. Some of this spending must be financed by selling American assets 
abroad, so foreign capital is flowing into the United States (NCO , 0). 
Figure 1
The Market for Loanable Funds
The interest rate in an open economy, as 
in a closed economy, is determined by the 
supply and demand for loanable funds. 
National saving is the source of the supply 
of loanable funds. Domestic investment 
and net capital outflow are the sources 
of the demand for loanable funds. At the 
equilibrium interest rate, the amount that 
people want to save exactly balances the 
amount that people want to borrow for 
the purpose of buying domestic capital and 
foreign assets.

Our model of the open economy treats the two sides of this identity as repre-
senting the two sides of the market for foreign-currency exchange. Net capital 
outflow represents the quantity of dollars supplied for the purpose of buying 
foreign assets. For example, when a U.S. mutual fund wants to buy a Japanese 
government bond, it needs to change dollars into yen, so it supplies dollars in 
the market for foreign-currency exchange. Net exports represent the quantity of 
dollars demanded for the purpose of buying U.S. net exports of goods and ser­
vices. For example, when a Japanese airline wants to buy a plane made by Boeing, 
it needs to change its yen into dollars, so it demands dollars in the market for 
foreign-currency exchange.
What price balances the supply and demand in the market for foreign-currency 
exchange? The answer is the real exchange rate. As we saw in the preceding 
chapter, the real exchange rate is the relative price of domestic and foreign goods 
and, therefore, is a key determinant of net exports. When the U.S. real exchange 
rate appreciates, U.S. goods become more expensive relative to foreign goods, 
making U.S. goods less attractive to consumers both at home and abroad. As a 
result, exports from the United States fall, and imports into the United States rise. 
For both reasons, net exports fall. Hence, an appreciation of the real exchange 
rate reduces the quantity of dollars demanded in the market for foreign-currency 
exchange.
Figure 2 shows supply and demand in the market for foreign-currency 
exchange. The demand curve slopes downward for the reason we just discussed: 
The real exchange rate is determined by the supply and demand for foreign-
currency exchange. The supply of dollars to be exchanged into foreign currency 
comes from net capital outflow. Because net capital outflow does not depend on 
the real exchange rate, the supply curve is vertical. The demand for dollars comes 
from net exports. Because a lower real exchange rate stimulates net exports (and 
thus increases the quantity of dollars demanded to pay for these net exports), 
the demand curve is downward sloping. At the equilibrium real exchange rate, 
the number of dollars people supply to buy foreign assets exactly balances the 
number of dollars people demand to buy net exports.

A higher real exchange rate makes U.S. goods more expensive and reduces the 
quantity of dollars demanded to buy those goods. The supply curve is vertical 
because the quantity of dollars supplied for net capital outflow does not depend 
on the real exchange rate. (As discussed earlier, net capital outflow depends on 
the real interest rate. When discussing the market for foreign-currency exchange, 
we take the real interest rate and net capital outflow as given.)
It might seem strange at first that net capital outflow does not depend on the 
exchange rate. After all, a higher exchange value of the U.S. dollar not only makes 
foreign goods less expensive for American buyers but also makes foreign assets 
less expensive. One might guess that this would make foreign assets more attrac-
tive. But remember that an American investor will eventually want to turn the 
foreign asset, as well as any profits earned on it, back into dollars. For example, 
a high value of the dollar makes it less expensive for an American to buy stock 
in a Japanese company, but when that stock pays dividends, those will be in yen. 
As these yen are exchanged for dollars, the high value of the dollar means that 
the dividend will buy fewer dollars. Thus, changes in the exchange rate influence 
both the cost of buying foreign assets and the benefit of owning them, and these 
two effects offset each other. For these reasons, our model of the open economy 
posits that net capital outflow does not depend on the real exchange rate, as 
represented by the vertical supply curve in Figure 2.
FYI
 Purchasing-Power Parity as a 
Special Case
A
n alert reader of this book might ask: Why are we developing a 
theory of the exchange rate here? Didn’t we already do that in 
the preceding chapter?
	
As you may recall, the preceding chapter developed a theory 
of the exchange rate called purchasing-power parity. This theory 
asserts that a dollar (or any other currency) must buy the same 
quantity of goods and services in every country. As a result, the real 
exchange rate is fixed, and all changes in the nominal exchange rate 
between two currencies reflect changes in the price levels in the two 
countries.
	
The model of the exchange rate developed here is related to 
the theory of purchasing-power parity. According to the theory of 
purchasing-power parity, international trade responds quickly to 
international price differences. If goods were cheaper in one country 
than in another, they would be exported from the first country and 
imported into the second until the price difference disappeared. In 
other words, the theory of purchasing-power parity assumes that net 
exports are highly responsive to small changes in the real exchange 
rate. If net exports were in fact so responsive, the demand curve in 
Figure 2 would be horizontal.
	
Thus, the theory of purchasing-power parity can be viewed as 
a special case of the model considered here. In that special case, 
the demand curve for foreign-currency exchange, rather than being 
downward sloping, is horizontal at the level of the real exchange 
rate that ensures parity of purchasing power at home and abroad. 
That special case is a good place to start when studying exchange 
rates, but it is far from the end of the story.
	
This chapter, therefore, concentrates on the more realistic case 
in which the demand curve for foreign-currency exchange is down-
ward sloping. This allows for the possibility that the real exchange 
rate changes over time, as in fact it sometimes does in the real 
world.

The real exchange rate moves to ensure equilibrium in this market. That is, 
it adjusts to balance the supply and demand for dollars just as the price of any 
good adjusts to balance supply and demand for that good. If the real exchange 
rate were below the equilibrium level, the quantity of dollars supplied would be 
less than the quantity demanded. The resulting shortage of dollars would push 
the value of the dollar upward. Conversely, if the real exchange rate were above 
the equilibrium level, the quantity of dollars supplied would exceed the quantity 
demanded. The surplus of dollars would drive the value of the dollar downward. 
At the equilibrium real exchange rate, the demand for dollars by foreigners arising from 
the U.S. net exports of goods and services exactly balances the supply of dollars from 
Americans arising from U.S. net capital outflow.
Quick Quiz  Describe the sources of supply and demand in the market for loanable 
funds and the market for foreign-currency exchange.
Equilibrium in the Open Economy
So far, we have discussed supply and demand in two markets: the market for 
loanable funds and the market for foreign-currency exchange. Let’s now consider 
how these markets are related to each other.
Net Capital Outflow: The Link between  
the Two Markets
We begin by recapping what we’ve learned so far in this chapter. We have been 
discussing how the economy coordinates four important macroeconomic vari-
ables: national saving (S), domestic investment (I), net capital outflow (NCO), and 
net exports (NX). Keep in mind the following identities:
S = I + NCO
and
NCO = NX.
In the market for loanable funds, supply comes from national saving (S), demand 
comes from domestic investment (I) and net capital outflow (NCO), and the real 
interest rate balances supply and demand. In the market for foreign-currency 
exchange, supply comes from net capital outflow (NCO), demand comes from net 
exports (NX), and the real exchange rate balances supply and demand.
Net capital outflow is the variable that links these two markets. In the market 
for loanable funds, net capital outflow is a piece of demand. A person who wants 
to buy an asset abroad must finance this purchase by obtaining resources in the 
market for loanable funds. In the market for foreign-currency exchange, net capi-
tal outflow is the source of supply. A person who wants to buy an asset in another 
country must supply dollars to exchange them for the currency of that country.
The key determinant of net capital outflow, as we have discussed, is the real 
interest rate. When the U.S. interest rate is high, owning U.S. assets is more attrac-
tive, and U.S. net capital outflow is low. Figure 3 shows this negative relationship 
between the interest rate and net capital outflow. This net-capital-outflow curve 
is the link between the market for loanable funds and the market for foreign-
currency exchange.

Simultaneous Equilibrium in Two Markets 
We can now put all the pieces of our model together in Figure 4. This figure shows 
how the market for loanable funds and the market for foreign-currency exchange 
jointly determine the important macroeconomic variables of an open economy.
Panel (a) of the figure shows the market for loanable funds (taken from Figure 1). 
As before, national saving is the source of the supply of loanable funds. Domestic 
investment and net capital outflow are the source of the demand for loanable funds. 
The equilibrium real interest rate (r1) brings the quantity of loanable funds supplied 
and the quantity of loanable funds demanded into balance.
Panel (b) of the figure shows net capital outflow (taken from Figure 3). It shows 
how the interest rate from panel (a) determines net capital outflow. A higher inter-
est rate at home makes domestic assets more attractive, and this in turn reduces 
net capital outflow. Therefore, the net-capital-outflow curve in panel (b) slopes 
downward.
Panel (c) of the figure shows the market for foreign-currency exchange (taken 
from Figure 2). Because foreign assets must be purchased with foreign currency, 
the quantity of net capital outflow from panel (b) determines the supply of dol-
lars to be exchanged into foreign currencies. The real exchange rate does not affect 
net capital outflow, so the supply curve is vertical. The demand for dollars comes 
from net exports. Because a depreciation of the real exchange rate increases net 
exports, the demand curve for foreign-currency exchange slopes downward. The 
equilibrium real exchange rate (E1) brings into balance the quantity of dollars sup-
plied and the quantity of dollars demanded in the market for foreign-currency 
exchange.
The two markets shown in Figure 4 determine two relative prices: the real 
interest rate and the real exchange rate. The real interest rate determined in 
panel (a) is the price of goods and services in the present relative to goods and 
services in the future. The real exchange rate determined in panel (c) is the price 
of domestic goods and services relative to foreign goods and services. These two 
Figure 3
How Net Capital Outflow Depends 
on the Interest Rate
Because a higher domestic real 
interest rate makes domestic assets 
more attractive, it reduces net 
capital outflow. Note the position 
of zero on the horizontal axis: Net 
capital outflow can be positive 
or negative. A negative value of 
net capital outflow means that 
the economy is experiencing a net 
inflow of capital.

relative prices adjust simultaneously to balance supply and demand in these two 
markets. As they do so, they determine national saving, domestic investment, net 
capital outflow, and net exports. In a moment, we will use this model to see how 
all these variables change when some policy or event causes one of these curves 
to shift.

In panel (a), the supply and demand for loanable funds determine the real

exchange determine the real exchange rate.

How Policies and Events Affect an Open Economy
Having developed a model to explain how key macroeconomic variables are deter-
mined in an open economy, we can now use the model to analyze how changes 
in policy and other events alter the economy’s equilibrium. As we proceed, keep 
in mind that our model is just supply and demand in two markets: the market 
for loanable funds and the market for foreign-currency exchange. When using 
the model to analyze any event, we can apply the three steps outlined in Chapter 
4. First, we determine which of the supply and demand curves the event affects. 
Second, we determine which way the curves shift. Third, we use the supply-and-
demand diagrams to examine how these shifts alter the economy’s equilibrium. 
Government Budget Deficits
When we first discussed the supply and demand for loanable funds earlier in the 
book, we examined the effects of government budget deficits, which occur when 
government spending exceeds government revenue. Because a government bud-
get deficit represents negative public saving, it reduces national saving (the sum of 
public and private saving). Thus, a government budget deficit reduces the supply 
of loanable funds, drives up the interest rate, and crowds out investment.
FYI
 Disentangling Supply and Demand
Suppose the owner of an apple orchard decides to consume some 
of his own apples. Does this decision represent an increase in the 
demand for apples or a decrease in the supply? Either answer 
is defensible, and as long as we are careful in our subsequent 
analysis, nothing important will hinge on which answer we choose. 
Sometimes how we divide things between supply and demand is a 
bit arbitrary.
	
In the macroeconomic model of the open economy developed 
in this chapter, the division of transactions between “supply” and 
“demand” is also a bit arbitrary. This is true both in the market for 
loanable funds and in the market for foreign-currency exchange.
	
Consider first the market for loanable funds. The model treats 
the net capital outflow as part of the demand for loanable funds. 
Yet instead of writing S = I + NCO, we could just as easily have 
written S – NCO = I. When the equation is rewritten in this way, a 
capital outflow looks like a reduction in the supply of loanable funds. 
Either way would have worked. The first interpretation (S = I + NCO ) 
emphasizes loanable funds generated domestically whether used at 
home or abroad. The second interpretation (S – NCO = I ) empha-
sizes loanable funds available for domestic investment whether 
generated at home or abroad. The difference is more semantic than 
substantive.
	
Similarly, consider the market for foreign-currency exchange. In 
our model, net exports are the source of the demand for dollars, and 
net capital outflow is the source of the supply. Thus, when a U.S. 
resident imports a car made in Japan, our model treats that transac-
tion as a decrease in the quantity of dollars demanded (because 
net exports fall) rather than an increase in the quantity of dollars 
supplied. Similarly, when a Japanese citizen buys a U.S. government 
bond, our model treats that transaction as a decrease in the quantity 
of dollars supplied (because net capital outflow falls) rather than an 
increase in the quantity of dollars demanded. This definition of terms 
may seem somewhat unnatural at first, but it will prove useful when 
analyzing the effects of various policies.

Now let’s consider the effects of a budget deficit in an open economy. First, 
which curve in our model shifts? As in a closed economy, the initial impact of the 
budget deficit is on national saving and, therefore, on the supply curve for loan­
able funds. Second, which way does this supply curve shift? Again as in a closed 
economy, a budget deficit represents negative public saving, so it reduces national 
saving and shifts the supply curve for loanable funds to the left. This is shown as 
the shift from S1 to S2 in panel (a) of Figure 5.
When the government runs a budget deficit, it reduces the supply of loanable funds 
from S1 to S2 in panel (a). The interest rate rises from r1 to r2 to balance the supply and 
demand for loanable funds. In panel (b), the higher interest rate reduces net capital 
outflow. Reduced net capital outflow, in turn, reduces the supply of dollars in the 
market for foreign-currency exchange from S1 to S2 in panel (c). This fall in the supply 
of dollars causes the real exchange rate to appreciate from E1 to E2. The appreciation 
of the exchange rate pushes the trade balance toward deficit.

Our third and final step is to compare the old and new equilibria. Panel (a) shows 
the impact of a U.S. budget deficit on the U.S. market for loanable funds. With fewer 
funds available for borrowers in U.S. financial markets, the interest rate rises from 
r1 to r2 to balance supply and demand. Faced with a higher interest rate, borrowers 
in the market for loanable funds choose to borrow less. This change is represented 
in the figure as the movement from point A to point B along the demand curve for 
loanable funds. In particular, households and firms reduce their purchases of capi-
tal goods. As in a closed economy, budget deficits crowd out domestic investment. 
In an open economy, however, the reduced supply of loanable funds has 
additional effects. Panel (b) shows that the increase in the interest rate from r1 to 
r2 reduces net capital outflow. [This fall in net capital outflow is also part of the 
decrease in the quantity of loanable funds demanded in the movement from point 
A to point B in panel (a).] Because saving kept at home now earns higher rates of 
return, investing abroad is less attractive, and domestic residents buy fewer for-
eign assets. Higher interest rates also attract foreign investors, who want to earn 
the higher returns on U.S. assets. Thus, when budget deficits raise interest rates, 
both domestic and foreign behavior cause U.S. net capital outflow to fall. 
Panel (c) shows how budget deficits affect the market for foreign-currency 
exchange. Because net capital outflow is reduced, people need less foreign cur-
rency to buy foreign assets and, therefore, supply fewer dollars in the market for 
foreign-currency exchange. The supply curve for dollars shifts leftward from S1 
to S2. The reduced supply of dollars causes the real exchange rate to appreciate 
from E1 to E2. That is, the dollar becomes more valuable compared to foreign cur-
rencies. This appreciation, in turn, makes U.S. goods more expensive compared 
to foreign goods. Because people both at home and abroad switch their purchases 
away from the more expensive U.S. goods, exports from the United States fall, and 
imports into the United States rise. For both reasons, U.S. net exports fall. Hence, 
in an open economy, government budget deficits raise real interest rates, crowd out domes-
tic investment, cause the currency to appreciate, and push the trade balance toward deficit. 
An important example of this lesson occurred in the United States in the 1980s. 
Shortly after Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, the fiscal policy of 
the U.S. federal government changed dramatically. The president and Congress 
enacted large cuts in taxes, but they did not cut government spending by nearly 
as much, so the result was a large budget deficit. Our model of the open economy 
predicts that such a policy should lead to a trade deficit, and in fact it did, as we 
saw in a case study in the preceding chapter. Because the budget deficit and trade 
deficit during this period were so closely related in both theory and practice, they 
were nicknamed the twin deficits. We should not, however, view these twins as 
identical, for many factors beyond fiscal policy can influence the trade deficit.
Trade Policy
A trade policy is a government policy that directly influences the quantity of 
goods and services that a country imports or exports. Trade policy takes various 
forms, usually with the purpose of supporting a particular domestic industry. 
One common trade policy is a tariff, a tax on imported goods. Another is an import 
quota, a limit on the quantity of a good produced abroad that can be sold domesti-
cally. Trade policies are common throughout the world, although sometimes they 
are disguised. For example, the U.S. government has sometimes pressured Japa-
nese automakers to reduce the number of cars they sell in the United States. These 
so-called voluntary export restrictions are not really voluntary and, in essence, are 
a form of import quota.

Let’s consider the macroeconomic impact of trade policy. Suppose that the U.S. 
auto industry, concerned about competition from Japanese automakers, convinces 
the U.S. government to impose a quota on the number of cars that can be imported 
from Japan. In making their case, lobbyists for the auto industry assert that the 
trade restriction would shrink the size of the U.S. trade deficit. Are they right? Our 
model, as illustrated in Figure 6, offers an answer.
The first step in analyzing the trade policy is to determine which curve shifts. 
The initial impact of the import restriction is, not surprisingly, on imports. Because 
When the U.S. government imposes a quota on the import of Japanese cars, nothing 
happens in the market for loanable funds in panel (a) or to net capital outflow in 
panel (b). The only effect is a rise in net exports (exports minus imports) for any given 
real exchange rate. As a result, the demand for dollars in the market for foreign-
currency exchange rises, as shown by the shift from D1 to D2 in panel (c). This increase 
in the demand for dollars causes the value of the dollar to appreciate from E1 to E2. 
This appreciation of the dollar tends to reduce net exports, offsetting the direct effect 
of the import quota on the trade balance.

net exports equal exports minus imports, the policy also affects net exports. And 
because net exports are the source of demand for dollars in the market for foreign-
currency exchange, the policy affects the demand curve in this market.
The second step is to determine which way this demand curve shifts. Because 
the quota restricts the number of Japanese cars sold in the United States, it reduces 
imports at any given real exchange rate. Net exports, which equal exports minus 
imports, will therefore rise for any given real exchange rate. Because foreigners 
need dollars to buy U.S. net exports, there is an increased demand for dollars in 
the market for foreign-currency exchange. This increase in the demand for dollars 
is shown in panel (c) of Figure 6 as the shift from D1 to D2.
The third step is to compare the old and new equilibria. As we can see in panel 
(c), the increase in the demand for dollars causes the real exchange rate to appreci-
ate from E1 to E2. Because nothing has happened in the market for loanable funds 
in panel (a), there is no change in the real interest rate. Because there is no change 
in the real interest rate, there is also no change in net capital outflow, shown in 
panel (b). And because there is no change in net capital outflow, there can be no 
change in net exports, even though the import quota has reduced imports.
It might seem puzzling that net exports stay the same while imports fall.  This 
puzzle is resolved by noting the change in the real exchange rate: When the dollar 
appreciates in value in the market for foreign-currency exchange, domestic goods 
become more expensive relative to foreign goods. This appreciation encourages 
imports and discourages exports, and both of these changes work to offset the direct 
increase in net exports due to the import quota. In the end, an import quota reduces 
both imports and exports, but net exports (exports minus imports) are unchanged.
We have thus come to a surprising implication: Trade policies do not affect the 
trade balance. That is, policies that directly influence exports or imports do not 
alter net exports. This conclusion seems less surprising if one recalls the account-
ing identity:
NX = NCO = S – I.
Net exports equal net capital outflow, which equals national saving minus domes-
tic investment. Trade policies do not alter the trade balance because they do not 
alter national saving or domestic investment. For given levels of national saving 
and domestic investment, the real exchange rate adjusts to keep the trade balance 
the same, regardless of the trade policies the government puts in place.
Although trade policies do not affect a country’s overall trade balance, these 
policies do affect specific firms, industries, and countries. When the U.S. government 
imposes an import quota on Japanese cars, General Motors has less competition from 
abroad and will sell more cars. At the same time, because the dollar has appreciated 
in value, Boeing, the U.S. aircraft maker, will find it harder to compete with Airbus, 
the European aircraft maker. U.S. exports of aircraft will fall, and U.S. imports of air-
craft will rise. In this case, the import quota on Japanese cars will increase net exports 
of cars and decrease net exports of planes. In addition, it will increase net exports 
from the United States to Japan and decrease net exports from the United States to 
Europe. The overall trade balance of the U.S. economy, however, stays the same.
The effects of trade policies are, therefore, more microeconomic than macroeco-
nomic. Although advocates of trade policies sometimes claim (incorrectly) that 
these policies can alter a country’s trade balance, they are usually more motivated 
by concerns about particular firms or industries. One should not be surprised, for 
instance, to hear an executive from General Motors advocating import quotas for 
Japanese cars. Economists usually oppose such trade policies. Free trade allows

economies to specialize in doing what they do best, making residents of all coun-
tries better off. Trade restrictions interfere with these gains from trade and, thus, 
reduce overall economic well-being.
Political Instability and Capital Flight
In 1994, political instability in Mexico, including the assassination of a prominent 
political leader, made world financial markets nervous. People began to view 
Mexico as a much less stable country than they had previously thought. They 
decided to pull some of their assets out of Mexico to move these funds to the 
United States and other “safe havens.” Such a large and sudden movement of 
funds out of a country is called capital flight. To see the implications of capital 
flight for the Mexican economy, we again follow our three steps for analyzing a 
change in equilibrium, but this time, we apply our model of the open economy 
from the perspective of Mexico rather than the United States.
Consider first which curves in our model capital flight affects. When investors 
around the world observe political problems in Mexico, they decide to sell some 
of their Mexican assets and use the proceeds to buy U.S. assets. This act increases 
Mexican net capital outflow and, therefore, affects both markets in our model. 
Most obviously, it affects the net-capital-outflow curve, and this in turn influences 
the supply of pesos in the market for foreign-currency exchange. In addition, 
because the demand for loanable funds comes from both domestic investment 
and net capital outflow, capital flight affects the demand curve in the market for 
loanable funds. 
Now consider which way these curves shift. When net capital outflow increases, 
there is greater demand for loanable funds to finance these purchases of capital 
assets abroad. Thus, as panel (a) of Figure 7 shows, the demand curve for loanable 
funds shifts to the right from D1 to D2. In addition, because net capital outflow is 
higher for any interest rate, the net-capital-outflow curve also shifts to the right 
from NCO1 to NCO2, as in panel (b).  
To see the effects of capital flight on the Mexican economy, we compare the 
old and new equilibria. Panel (a) of Figure 7 shows that the increased demand 
for loanable funds causes the interest rate in Mexico to rise from r1 to r2. Panel (b) 
shows that Mexican net capital outflow increases. (Although the rise in the interest 
rate does make Mexican assets more attractive, this only partly offsets the impact of 
capital flight on net capital outflow.) Panel (c) shows that the increase in net capital 
outflow raises the supply of pesos in the market for foreign-currency exchange 
from S1 to S2. That is, as people try to get out of Mexican assets, there is a large sup-
ply of pesos to be converted into dollars. This increase in supply causes the peso to 
depreciate from E1 to E2. Thus, capital flight from Mexico increases Mexican interest rates 
and decreases the value of the Mexican peso in the market for foreign-currency exchange. 
This is exactly what was observed in 1994. From November 1994 to March 1995, 
the interest rate on short-term Mexican government bonds rose from 14 percent 
to 70 percent, and the peso depreciated in value from 29 to 15 U.S. cents per peso.
These price changes that result from capital flight influence some key mac­ro­
economic quantities. The depreciation of the currency makes exports cheaper and 
imports more expensive, pushing the trade balance toward surplus. At the same 
time, the increase in the interest rate reduces domestic investment, which slows 
capital accumulation and economic growth.
Capital flight has its largest impact on the country from which capital is flee-
ing, but it also affects other countries. When capital flows out of Mexico into the 
United States, for instance, it has the opposite effect on the U.S. economy as it has 
capital flight
a large and sudden 
reduction in the demand 
for assets located in a

on the Mexican economy. In particular, the rise in Mexican net capital outflow 
coincides with a fall in U.S. net capital outflow. As the peso depreciates in value 
and Mexican interest rates rise, the dollar appreciates in value and U.S. interest 
rates fall. The size of this impact on the U.S. economy is small, however, because 
the economy of the United States is so large compared to that of Mexico.
The events that we have been describing in Mexico could happen to any 
economy in the world, and, in fact, they do from time to time. In 1997, the world 
Figure 7
The Effects of  
Capital Flight
If people decide that Mexico is a risky place to keep their savings, they will move their 
capital to safer havens such as the United States, resulting in an increase in Mexican 
net capital outflow. Consequently, the demand for loanable funds in Mexico rises 
from D1 to D2, as shown in panel (a), and this drives up the Mexican real interest rate 
from r1 to r2. Because net capital outflow is higher for any interest rate, that curve also 
shifts to the right from NCO1 to NCO2 in panel (b). At the same time, in the market for 
foreign-currency exchange, the supply of pesos rises from S1 to S2, as shown in panel 
(c). This increase in the supply of pesos causes the peso to depreciate from E1 to E2, so 
the peso becomes less valuable compared to other currencies.

learned that the banking systems of several Asian economies, including Thailand, 
South Korea, and Indonesia, were at or near the point of bankruptcy, and this 
news induced capital to flee from these nations. In 1998, the Russian government 
defaulted on its debt, inducing international investors to take whatever money 
they could and run. A similar (but more complicated) set of events unfolded in 
Argentina in 2002. In each of these cases of capital flight, the results were much as 
our model predicts: rising interest rates and a falling currency. 
Capital Flows from China
According to our analysis of capital flight, a nation that experiences an outflow of 
capital sees its currency weaken in foreign exchange markets, and this deprecia-
tion in turn increases the nation’s net exports. The country into which the capital 
is flowing sees it currency strengthen, and this appreciation pushes its trade bal-
ance toward deficit.
	
With these lessons in mind, consider this question: Suppose a nation’s govern-
ment, as a matter of policy, encourages capital to flow to another country, perhaps 
by making foreign investments itself. What effect would this policy have? The 
answer is much the same: Other things equal, it leads to a weaker currency and a 
trade surplus for the nation encouraging the capital outflows and a stronger cur-
rency and a trade deficit for the recipient of those capital flows.
	
This analysis thus sheds light on one of the ongoing policy disputes between 
the United States and China. In recent years, the Chinese government has tried to 
depress the value of its currency—the renminbi—in foreign exchange markets to 
promote its export industries. It does this by accumulating foreign assets, includ-
ing substantial amounts of U.S government bonds. As of the end of 2009, China’s 
total reserves of foreign assets were about $2.4 trillion.
	
The U.S. government has at times objected to China’s interventions in 
foreign-exchange markets. By holding down the value of the renminbi, the 
policy makes Chinese goods less expensive, which in turn contributes to the 
U.S. trade deficit and hurts American producers who make products that com-
pete with imports from China. Because of these effects, the U.S. government has 
encouraged China to stop influencing the exchange value of its currency with 
government-sponsored capital flows. Some members of Congress have even 
gone so far as to advocate tariffs on Chinese imports unless China ceases its 
“currency manipulation.”
	
Yet the impact of the Chinese policy on the U.S. economy is not all bad. 
American consumers of Chinese imports benefit from lower prices. In addition, 
the inflow of capital from China lowers U.S. interest rates, which in turn increases 
investment in the U.S. economy. To some extent, the Chinese government is 
financing U.S. economic growth. The Chinese policy of investing in the U.S. 
economy creates winners and losers among Americans. All things considered, the 
net impact on the U.S. economy is probably small. 
	
The harder question concerns the motives behind the policy: Why are the 
Chinese leaders interested in producing for export and investing abroad, rather 
than producing for domestic consumption and investing at home? There is no 
obvious answer. One possibility is that China wants to accumulate a reserve of 
foreign assets on which it can draw in emergencies—a kind of national “rainy-day 
fund.” Another possibility is that the policy is simply misguided.  ■

Quick Quiz  Suppose that Americans decided to spend a smaller fraction of their 
incomes. What would be the effect on saving, investment, interest rates, the real 
exchange rate, and the trade balance?
Conclusion
International economics is a topic of increasing importance. More and more, 
American citizens are buying goods produced abroad and producing goods to 
be sold overseas. Through mutual funds and other financial institutions, they 
borrow and lend in world financial markets. As a result, a full analysis of the U.S. 
economy requires an understanding of how the U.S. economy interacts with other 
economies in the world. This chapter has provided a basic model for thinking 
about the macroeconomics of open economies.
The Coins That Have 
Three Sides
By N. Gregory Mankiw
A
s the world economy struggles to 
recover from its various ailments, the 
international financial order is coming under 
increased scrutiny. Currencies and exchange 
rates, in particular, are getting a hard look. 
	
Various pundits and politicians, includ-
ing President Obama himself, have com-
plained that the Chinese renminbi is under-
valued and impeding a global recovery. 
The problems in Greece have caused many 
people to wonder whether the euro is a 
failed experiment and whether Europe’s 
nations would have been better off main-
taining their own currencies.
	
In thinking about these issues, the place to 
start is what economists call the fundamental 
trilemma of international finance. Yes, trilemma 
really is a word. It has been a term of art for 
logicians since the 17th century, according to 
the Oxford English Dictionary, and it describes 
a situation in which someone faces a choice 
among three options, each of which comes 
with some inevitable problems.
	
What is the trilemma in international 
finance? It stems from the fact that, in most 
nations, economic policy makers would like 
to achieve these three goals: 
• Make the country’s economy open to 
international flows of capital. Capital 
mobility lets a nation’s citizens diversify 
their holdings by investing abroad. It 
also encourages foreign investors to 
bring their resources and expertise into 
the country. 
• Use monetary policy as a tool to help 
stabilize the economy. The central bank 
can then increase the money supply and 
reduce interest rates when the economy 
is depressed, and reduce money growth 
and raise interest rates when it is over-
heated.
• Maintain stability in the currency exchange 
rate. A volatile exchange rate, at times 
driven by speculation, can be a source of 
broader economic volatility. Moreover, a 
stable rate makes it easier for households 
and businesses to engage in the world 
economy and plan for the future. 
	
But here’s the rub: You can’t get all 
three. If you pick two of these goals, the 
inexorable logic of economics forces you to 
forgo the third. 
	
In the United States, we have picked 
the first two. Any American can easily 
invest abroad, simply by sending cash to 
an international mutual fund, and foreign-
ers are free to buy stocks and bonds on 
domestic exchanges. Moreover, the Federal 
 Alternative Exchange-Rate Regimes
Different nations adopt different policies toward the value of their 
currencies in foreign exchange markets. This article explains why.

The study of international economics is valuable, but we should be care-
ful not to exaggerate its importance. Policymakers and commentators are 
often quick to blame foreigners for problems facing the U.S. economy. By 
contrast, economists more often view these problems as homegrown. For 
example, politicians often discuss foreign competition as a threat to Ameri-
can living standards, while economists are more likely to lament the low 
level of national saving. Low saving impedes growth in capital, productivity, 
and living standards, regardless of whether the economy is open or closed. 
Foreigners are a convenient target for politicians because blaming foreign-
ers provides a way to avoid responsibility without insulting any domestic 
constituency. Whenever you hear popular discussions of international trade 
and finance, therefore, it is especially important to try to separate myth from 
reality. The tools you have learned in the past two chapters should help in 
that endeavor.
Reserve sets monetary policy to try to main-
tain full employment and price stability. 
But a result of this decision is volatility in 
the value of the dollar in foreign exchange 
markets. 
	
By contrast, China has chosen a differ-
ent response to the trilemma. Its central 
bank conducts monetary policy and main-
tains tight control over the exchange value 
of its currency. But to accomplish these 
two goals, it has to restrict the interna-
tional flow of capital, including the ability 
of Chinese citizens to move their wealth 
abroad. Without such restrictions, money 
would flow into and out of the country, 
forcing the domestic interest rate to match 
those set by foreign central banks.
	
Most of Europe’s nations have chosen 
the third way. By using the euro to replace 
the French franc, the German mark, the 
Italian lira, the Greek drachma and other 
currencies, these countries have eliminated 
all exchange-rate movements within their 
zone. In addition, capital is free to move 
among nations. Yet the cost of making these 
choices has been to give up the possibility of 
national monetary policy. 
	
The European Central Bank sets interest 
rates for Europe as a whole. But if the situa-
tion in one country—Greece, for example—
differs from that in the rest of Europe, that 
country no longer has its own monetary 
policy to address national problems.
	
Is there a best way to deal with 
this trilemma? Perhaps not surprisingly, 
many American economists argue for the 
American system of floating exchange rates 
determined by market forces. This preference 
underlies much of the criticism of China’s 
financial policy. It also led to skepticism 
when Europe started down the path toward 
a common currency in the early 1990s. 
Today, those euro skeptics feel vindicated by 
the problems in Greece.
	
But economists should be cautious 
when recommending exchange-rate policy, 
because it is far from obvious what is best. 
In fact, Americans’ embrace of floating 
exchange rates is relatively recent. From 
World War II to the early 1970s, the United 
States participated in the Bretton Woods 
system, which fixed exchange rates among 
the major currencies. Moreover, in 1998, as 
much of Asia was engulfed in a financial 
crisis, Robert E. Rubin, then the Treasury 
secretary, praised China’s exchange-rate 
policy as an “island of stability” in a turbu-
lent world.
	
Even the euro experiment is based in 
part on an American model. Anyone tak-
ing a trip across the United States doesn’t 
need to change money with every crossing 
of a state border. A common currency 
among the 50 states has served Americans 
well. Europeans were aspiring for similar 
benefits.
	
To be sure, Europe is different from the 
United States, which has a large central 
government that can redistribute resources 
among regions as needed. More important, 
our common language and heritage allow 
labor to move freely among regions in a way 
that will always be harder in Europe. The 
United States of Europe may have been too 
much to hope for.
	
Without doubt, the world financial sys-
tem presents policy makers with difficult 
tradeoffs. Americans shouldn’t be too harsh 
when other nations facing the trilemma 
reach conclusions different from ours. In this 
area of economic policy, as well as many 
others, there is room for reasonable nations 
to disagree.

Summary
• Two markets are central to the macroeconomics 
of open economies: the market for loanable funds 
and the market for foreign-currency exchange. 
In the market for loanable funds, the real inter-
est rate adjusts to balance the supply of loanable 
funds (from national saving) and the demand for 
loanable funds (from domestic investment and 
net capital outflow). In the market for foreign-
currency exchange, the real exchange rate adjusts 
to balance the supply of dollars (from net capital 
outflow) and the demand for dollars (for net 
exports). Because net capital outflow is part of the 
demand for loanable funds and because it pro-
vides the supply of dollars for foreign-currency 
exchange, it is the variable that connects these 
two markets.
• A policy that reduces national saving, such as 
a government budget deficit, reduces the sup-
ply of loanable funds and drives up the interest 
rate. The higher interest rate reduces net capital 
outflow, which reduces the supply of dollars in 
the market for foreign-currency exchange. The 
dollar appreciates, and net exports fall.
• Although restrictive trade policies, such as tariffs 
or quotas on imports, are sometimes advocated 
as a way to alter the trade balance, they do not 
necessarily have that effect. A trade restriction 
increases net exports for any given exchange rate 
and, therefore, increases the demand for dollars 
in the market for foreign-currency exchange. As 
a result, the dollar appreciates in value, making 
domestic goods more expensive relative to for-
eign goods. This appreciation offsets the initial 
impact of the trade restriction on net exports. 
• When investors change their attitudes about 
holding assets of a country, the ramifications 
for the country’s economy can be profound. In 
particular, political instability can lead to capital 
flight, which tends to increase interest rates and 
cause the currency to depreciate.
	 1.	 Describe supply and demand in the market  
for loanable funds and the market for foreign-
currency exchange. How are these markets linked?
	 2.	 Why are budget deficits and trade deficits 
sometimes called the twin deficits?
	 3.	 Suppose that a textile workers’ union encour-
ages people to buy only American-made 
clothes. What would this policy do to the trade 
balance and the real exchange rate? What is 
the impact on the textile industry? What is the 
impact on the auto industry? 
	 4.	 What is capital flight? When a country experi-
ences capital flight, what is the effect on its 
interest rate and exchange rate?
Key Concepts
Questions for Review
Problems and Applications
	 1.	 Japan generally runs a significant trade surplus. 
Do you think this is most related to high foreign 
demand for Japanese goods, low Japanese demand 
for foreign goods, a high Japanese saving rate rela-
tive to Japanese investment, or structural barriers 
against imports into Japan? Explain your answer.
	 2.	 Suppose that Congress is considering an investment 
tax credit, which subsidizes domestic investment.

a.	 How does this policy affect national saving, 
domestic investment, net capital outflow, the 
interest rate, the exchange rate, and the trade 
balance?
b.	Representatives of several large exporters 
oppose the policy. Why might that be the 
case?
	 3.	 The chapter notes that the rise in the U.S. trade 
deficit during the 1980s was due largely to the 
rise in the U.S. budget deficit. On the other 
hand, the popular press sometimes claims 
that the increased trade deficit resulted from a 
decline in the quality of U.S. products relative to 
foreign products.
a.	 Assume that U.S. products did decline in  
relative quality during the 1980s. How did 
this affect net exports at any given exchange 
rate?
b.	Draw a three-panel diagram to show the 
effect of this shift in net exports on the U.S. 
real exchange rate and trade balance.
c.	 Is the claim in the popular press consistent 
with the model in this chapter? Does a decline 
in the quality of U.S. products have any effect 
on our standard of living? (Hint: When we 
sell our goods to foreigners, what do we 
receive in return?)
	 4.	 An economist discussing trade policy in The 
New Republic wrote: “One of the benefits of the 
United States removing its trade restrictions [is] 
the gain to U.S. industries that produce goods 
for export. Export industries would find it 
easier to sell their goods abroad—even if other 
countries didn’t follow our example and reduce 
their trade barriers.” Explain in words why U.S. 
export industries would benefit from a reduction 
in restrictions on imports to the United States. 
	 5.	 Suppose the French suddenly develop a strong 
taste for California wines. Answer the following 
questions in words and with a diagram.
a.	 What happens to the demand for dollars in 
the market for foreign-currency exchange?
b.	What happens to the value of dollars in the 
market for foreign-currency exchange?
c.	 What happens to the quantity of net exports?
	 6.	 A senator renounces her past support for  
protectionism: “The U.S. trade deficit must be 
reduced, but import quotas only annoy our 
trading partners. If we subsidize U.S. exports 
instead, we can reduce the deficit by increasing 
our competitiveness.” Using a three-panel  
diagram, show the effect of an export subsidy 
on net exports and the real exchange rate. Do 
you agree with the senator?
	 7.	 Suppose the United States decides to subsidize 
the export of U.S. agricultural products, but it 
does not increase taxes or decrease any other 
government spending to offset this expendi-
ture. Using a three-panel diagram, show what 
happens to national saving, domestic invest-
ment, net capital outflow, the interest rate, 
the exchange rate, and the trade balance. Also 
explain in words how this U.S. policy affects the 
amount of imports, exports, and net exports. 
	 8.	 Suppose that real interest rates increase across 
Europe. Explain how this development will 
affect U.S. net capital outflow. Then explain how 
it will affect U.S. net exports by using a formula 
from the chapter and by drawing a diagram. 
What will happen to the U.S. real interest rate 
and real exchange rate?
	 9.	 Suppose that Americans decide to increase their 
saving.
a.	 If the elasticity of U.S. net capital outflow 
with respect to the real interest rate is very 
high, will this increase in private saving 
have a large or small effect on U.S. domestic 
investment?
b.	If the elasticity of U.S. exports with respect 
to the real exchange rate is very low, will this 
increase in private saving have a large or 
small effect on the U.S. real exchange rate?
10.	 Over the past decade, some of Chinese saving 
has been used to finance American investment. 
That is, the Chinese have been buying American 
capital assets.
a.	 If the Chinese decided they no longer wanted 
to buy U.S. assets, what would happen in the 
U.S. market for loanable funds? In particular, 
what would happen to U.S. interest rates, 
U.S. saving, and U.S. investment? 
b.	What would happen in the market for  
foreign-currency exchange? In particular, 
what would happen to the value of the dollar 
and the U.S. trade balance? 
	11.	 Suppose that U.S. mutual funds suddenly 
decide to invest more in Canada.
a.	 What happens to Canadian net capital out-
flow, Canadian saving, and Canadian domes-
tic investment?
b.	What is the long-run effect on the Canadian 
capital stock?

c.	 How will this change in the capital stock 
affect the Canadian labor market? Does this 
U.S. investment in Canada make Canadian 
workers better off or worse off?
d.	Do you think this will make U.S. workers 
better off or worse off? Can you think of any 
reason the impact on U.S. citizens generally 
may be different from the impact on U.S. 
workers?
