hen you decide to buy a car, you may compare the latest models

may consider spending it on a beach in Florida or in Mexico. When 
you start saving for your retirement, you may choose between a 
mutual fund that buys stock in U.S. companies and one that buys stock in foreign 
companies. In all these cases, you are participating not just in the U.S. economy 
but in economies around the world.
Openness to international trade yields clear benefits: Trade allows people to 
produce what they produce best and to consume the great variety of goods and 
services produced around the world. Indeed, one of the Ten Principles of Economics 
highlighted in Chapter 1 is that trade can make everyone better off. International

trade can raise living standards in all countries by allowing each country to 
specialize in producing those goods and services in which it has a comparative 
advantage.
So far, our development of macroeconomics has largely ignored the economy’s 
interaction with other economies around the world. For most questions in macro­
economics, international issues are peripheral. For instance, when we discussed 
the natural rate of unemployment and the causes of inflation, the effects of inter­
national trade could safely be ignored. Indeed, to keep their models simple, mac­
roeconomists often assume a closed economy—an economy that does not interact 
with other economies.
Yet new macroeconomic issues arise in an open economy—an economy that 
interacts freely with other economies around the world. This chapter and the next, 
therefore, provide an introduction to open-economy macroeconomics. We begin 
in this chapter by discussing the key macroeconomic variables that describe an 
open economy’s interactions in world markets. You may have noticed mention of 
these variables—exports, imports, the trade balance, and exchange rates—when 
reading news reports or watching the nightly news. Our first job is to understand 
what these data mean. In the next chapter, we develop a model to explain how 
these vari­ables are determined and how they are affected by various government 
policies.
The International Flows of Goods and Capital
An open economy interacts with other economies in two ways: It buys and sells 
goods and services in world product markets, and it buys and sells capital assets 
such as stocks and bonds in world financial markets. Here we discuss these two 
activities and the close relationship between them.
The Flow of Goods: Exports, Imports,  
and Net Exports
Exports are domestically produced goods and services that are sold abroad, and 
imports are foreign-produced goods and services that are sold domestically. 
When Boeing, the U.S. aircraft manufacturer, builds a plane and sells it to Air 
France, the sale is an export for the United States and an import for France. When 
Volvo, the Swedish car manufacturer, makes a car and sells it to a U.S. resident, 
the sale is an import for the United States and an export for Sweden.
The net exports of any country are the difference between the value of its 
exports and the value of its imports:
Net exports = Value of country’s exports – Value of country’s imports.
The Boeing sale raises U.S. net exports, and the Volvo sale reduces U.S. net 
exports. Because net exports tell us whether a country is, in total, a seller or a 
buyer in world markets for goods and services, net exports are also called the 
trade balance. If net exports are positive, exports are greater than imports, indi­
cating that the country sells more goods and services abroad than it buys from 
other countries. In this case, the country is said to run a trade surplus. If net 
exports are negative, exports are less than imports, indicating that the country 
sells fewer goods and services abroad than it buys from other countries. In this

case, the country is said to run a trade deficit. If net exports are zero, its exports 
and imports are exactly equal, and the country is said to have balanced trade.
In the next chapter, we develop a theory that explains an economy’s trade balance, 
but even at this early stage, it is easy to think of many factors that might influence 
a country’s exports, imports, and net exports. Those factors include the following:
• 	 The tastes of consumers for domestic and foreign goods
• 	 The prices of goods at home and abroad
• 	 The exchange rates at which people can use domestic currency to buy  
foreign currencies
• 	 The incomes of consumers at home and abroad
• 	 The cost of transporting goods from country to country
• 	 Government policies toward international trade
As these variables change, so does the amount of international trade.
The Increasing Openness of the U.S. Economy
One dramatic change in the U.S. economy over the past six decades has been the 
increasing importance of international trade and finance. This change is illus­
trated in Figure 1, which shows the total value of goods and services exported to 
other countries and imported from other countries expressed as a percentage of 
gross domestic product. In the 1950s, imports and exports of goods and services 
were typically between 4 and 5 percent of GDP. In recent years, they have been 
more than twice that level. The trading partners of the United States include a 
diverse group of countries. As of 2009, the largest trading partner, as measured by 
imports and exports combined, was Canada, followed by China, Mexico, Japan, 
Germany, and the United Kingdom.

The increase in international trade over the past several decades is partly due 
to improvements in transportation. In 1950, the average merchant ship carried less 
than 10,000 tons of cargo; today, many ships carry more than 100,000 tons. The 
long-distance jet was introduced in 1958, and the wide-body jet in 1967, making 
air transport far cheaper than it had been. Because of these developments, goods 
that once had to be produced locally can now be traded around the world. Cut 
flowers grown in Israel are flown to the United States to be sold. Fresh fruits and 
vegetables that can grow only in summer can now be consumed in winter as well 
because they can be shipped to the United States from countries in the Southern 
Hemisphere.
	
The increase in international trade has also been influenced by advances in 
telecommunications, which have allowed businesses to reach overseas customers 
more easily. For example, the first transatlantic telephone cable was not laid until 
An iPod Has Global 
Value. Ask the  
(Many) Countries 
That Make It.
By Hal R. Varian
W
ho makes the Apple iPod? Here’s a 
hint: It is not Apple. The company 
outsources the entire manufacture of the 
device to a number of Asian enterprises, 
among them Asustek, Inventec Appliances 
and Foxconn.
	
But this list of companies isn’t a sat-
isfactory answer either: They only do final 
assembly. What about the 451 parts that go 
into the iPod? Where are they made and by 
whom?
	
Three researchers at the University of 
California, Irvine—Greg Linden, Kenneth L. 
Kraemer, and Jason Dedrick—applied some 
investigative cost accounting to this ques-
tion, using a report from Portelligent Inc. 
that examined all the parts that went into 
the iPod.
	
Their study, sponsored by the Sloan 
Foundation, offers a fascinating illustration 
of the complexity of the global economy, 
and how difficult it is to understand that 
complexity by using only conventional trade 
statistics.
	
The retail value of the 30-gigabyte video 
iPod that the authors examined was $299. 
The most expensive component in it was 
the hard drive, which was manufactured 
by Toshiba and costs about $73. The next 
most costly components were the display 
module (about $20), the video/multime-
dia processor chip ($8) and the controller 
chip ($5). They estimated that the final 
assembly, done in China, cost only about 
$4 a unit.
	
One approach to tracing supply chain 
geography might be to attribute the cost 
of each component to the country of origin 
of its maker. So $73 of the cost of the iPod 
would be attributed to Japan since Toshiba 
is a Japanese company, and the $13 cost 
of the two chips would be attributed to the 
United States, since the suppliers, Broadcom 
and PortalPlayer, are American companies, 
and so on.
	
But this method hides some of the 
most important details. Toshiba may be a 
Japanese company, but it makes most of 
its hard drives in the Philippines and China. 
So perhaps we should also allocate part of 
the cost of that hard drive to one of those 
countries. The same problem arises regard-
ing the Broadcom chips, with most of them 
manufactured in Taiwan. So how can one 
distribute the costs of the iPod components 
across the countries where they are manu-
factured in a meaningful way?

1956. As recently as 1966, the technology allowed only 138 simultaneous conver­
sations between North America and Europe. Today, communications satellites 
permit more than 1 million conversations to occur at the same time.
	
Technological progress has also fostered international trade by changing the 
kinds of goods that economies produce. When bulky raw materials (such as steel) 
and perishable goods (such as foodstuffs) were a large part of the world’s out­
put, transporting goods was often costly and sometimes impossible. By contrast, 
goods produced with modern technology are often light and easy to transport. 
Consumer electronics, for instance, have low weight for every dollar of value, 
which makes them easy to produce in one country and sell in another. An even 
more extreme example is the film industry. Once a studio in Hollywood makes 
a movie, it can send copies of the film around the world at almost zero cost. And 
indeed, movies are a major export of the United States.
	
To answer this question, let us look at 
the production process as a sequence of 
steps, each possibly performed by a differ-
ent company operating in a different coun-
try. At each step, inputs like computer chips 
and a bare circuit board are converted into 
outputs like an assembled circuit board. The 
difference between the cost of the inputs 
and the value of the outputs is the “value 
added” at that step, which can then be 
attributed to the country where that value 
was added.
	
The profit margin on generic parts like 
nuts and bolts is very low, since these items 
are produced in intensely competitive indus-
tries and can be manufactured anywhere. 
Hence, they add little to the final value of 
the iPod. More specialized parts, like the 
hard drives and controller chips, have much 
higher value added.
	
According to the authors’ estimates, the 
$73 Toshiba hard drive in the iPod contains 
about $54 in parts and labor. So the value 
that Toshiba added to the hard drive was 
$19 plus its own direct labor costs. This 
$19 is attributed to Japan since Toshiba is a 
Japanese company.
	
Continuing in this way, the researchers 
examined the major components of the 
iPod and tried to calculate the value added 
at different stages of the production process 
and then assigned that value added to the 
country where the value was created. This 
isn’t an easy task, but even based on their 
initial examination, it is quite clear that the 
largest share of the value added in the iPod 
goes to enterprises in the United States, 
particularly for units sold here.
	
The researchers estimated that $163 of 
the iPod’s $299 retail value in the United 
States was captured by American compa-
nies and workers, breaking it down to $75 
for distribution and retail costs, $80 to 
Apple, and $8 to various domestic compo-
nent makers. Japan contributed about $26 
to the value added (mostly via the Toshiba 
disk drive), while Korea contributed less 
than $1.
	
The unaccounted-for parts and labor costs 
involved in making the iPod came to about 
$110. The authors hope to assign those labor 
costs to the appropriate countries, but as the 
hard drive example illustrates, that’s not so 
easy to do.
	
This value added calculation illustrates 
the futility of summarizing such a complex 
manufacturing process by using conven-
tional trade statistics. Even though Chinese 
workers contribute only about 1 percent 
of the value of the iPod, the export of a 
finished iPod to the United States directly 
contributes about $150 to our bilateral 
trade deficit with the Chinese.
	
Ultimately, there is no simple answer to 
who makes the iPod or where it is made. 
The iPod, like many other products, is made 
in several countries by dozens of companies, 
with each stage of production contributing a 
different amount to the final value.
	
The real value of the iPod doesn’t lie 
in its parts or even in putting those parts 
together. The bulk of the iPod’s value is 
in the conception and design of the iPod. 
That is why Apple gets $80 for each of 
these video iPods it sells, which is by far the 
largest piece of value added in the entire 
supply chain.
	
Those clever folks at Apple figured out 
how to combine 451 mostly generic parts 
into a valuable product. They may not make 
the iPod, but they created it. In the end, 
that’s what really matters.

The government’s trade policies have also been a factor in increasing interna­
tional trade. As we discussed earlier in this book, economists have long believed that 
free trade between countries is mutually beneficial. Over time, most policymakers 
around the world have come to accept these conclusions. International agreements, 
such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), have gradually lowered tariffs, import 
quotas, and other trade barriers. The pattern of increasing trade illustrated in Figure 1 
is a phenomenon that most economists and policymakers endorse and encourage. ■
The Flow of Financial Resources:  
Net Capital Outflow
So far, we have been discussing how residents of an open economy participate in 
world markets for goods and services. In addition, residents of an open economy 
participate in world financial markets. A U.S. resident with $20,000 could use that 
money to buy a car from Toyota, or he could instead use that money to buy stock 
in the Toyota Corporation. The first transaction would represent a flow of goods, 
whereas the second would represent a flow of capital.
The term net capital outflow refers to the difference between the purchase 
of foreign assets by domestic residents and the purchase of domestic assets by 
foreigners:
Net capital outflow = Purchase of foreign assets by domestic residents 
	
– Purchase of domestic assets by foreigners.
When a U.S. resident buys stock in Telmex, the Mexican telecommunications 
company, the purchase increases the first term on the right side of this equation 
and, therefore, increases U.S. net capital outflow. When a Japanese resident buys 
a bond issued by the U.S. government, the purchase increases the second term on 
the right side of this equation and, therefore, decreases U.S. net capital outflow.
The flow of capital between the U.S. economy and the rest of the world takes 
two forms. If McDonald’s opens up a fast-food outlet in Russia, that is an example 
of foreign direct investment. Alternatively, if an American buys stock in a Russian 
corporation, that is an example of foreign portfolio investment. In the first case, the 
American owner (McDonald’s Corporation) actively manages the investment, 
whereas in the second case, the American owner (the stockholder) has a more 
passive role. In both cases, U.S. residents are buying assets located in another 
country, so both purchases increase U.S. net capital outflow.
The net capital outflow (sometimes called net foreign investment) can be either 
positive or negative. When it is positive, domestic residents are buying more 
foreign assets than foreigners are buying domestic assets. Capital is said to be 
flowing out of the country. When the net capital outflow is negative, domestic 
resi­dents are buying less foreign assets than foreigners are buying domestic 
assets. Capital is said to be flowing into the country. That is, when net capital 
outflow is negative, a country is experiencing a capital inflow.
We develop a theory to explain net capital outflow in the next chapter. Here 
let’s consider briefly some of the more important variables that influence net 
capital outflow:
• 	 The real interest rates paid on foreign assets
• 	 The real interest rates paid on domestic assets
• 	 The perceived economic and political risks of holding assets abroad
• 	 The government policies that affect foreign ownership of domestic assets

For example, consider U.S. investors deciding whether to buy Mexican govern­
ment bonds or U.S. government bonds. (Recall that a bond is, in effect, an IOU of 
the issuer.) To make this decision, U.S. investors compare the real interest rates 
offered on the two bonds. The higher a bond’s real interest rate, the more attrac­
tive it is. While making this comparison, however, U.S. investors must also take 
into account the risk that one of these governments might default on its debt (that 
is, not pay interest or principal when it is due), as well as any restrictions that 
the Mexican government has imposed, or might impose in the future, on foreign 
investors in Mexico.
The Equality of Net Exports and Net Capital Outflow
We have seen that an open economy interacts with the rest of the world in two 
ways—in world markets for goods and services and in world financial markets. 
Net exports and net capital outflow each measure a type of imbalance in these 
markets. Net exports measure an imbalance between a country’s exports and 
its imports. Net capital outflow measures an imbalance between the amount of 
foreign assets bought by domestic residents and the amount of domestic assets 
bought by foreigners.
An important but subtle fact of accounting states that, for an economy as a 
whole, net capital outflow (NCO) must always equal net exports (NX):
NCO = NX.
This equation holds because every transaction that affects one side of this equation 
affects the other side by exactly the same amount. This equation is an identity—
an equation that must hold because of the way the variables in the equation are 
defined and measured.
To see why this accounting identity is true, let’s consider an example. Imagine 
that you are a computer programmer residing in the United States. One day, you 
write some software and sell it to a Japanese consumer for 10,000 yen. The sale of 
software is an export of the United States, so it increases U.S. net exports. What 
else happens to ensure that this identity holds? The answer depends on what you 
do with the 10,000 yen you are paid.
First, let’s suppose that you simply stuff the yen in your mattress. (We might 
say you have a yen for yen.) In this case, you are using some of your income to 
invest in the Japanese economy. That is, a domestic resident (you) has acquired a 
foreign asset (the Japanese currency). The increase in U.S. net exports is matched 
by an increase in the U.S. net capital outflow.
More realistically, however, if you want to invest in the Japanese economy, you 
won’t do so by holding on to Japanese currency. More likely, you would use the 
10,000 yen to buy stock in a Japanese corporation, or you might buy a Japanese 
government bond. Yet the result of your decision is much the same: A domestic 
resident ends up acquiring a foreign asset. The increase in U.S. net capital outflow 
(the purchase of the Japanese stock or bond) exactly equals the increase in U.S. net 
exports (the sale of software).
Let’s now change the example. Suppose that instead of using the 10,000 yen to 
buy a Japanese asset, you use it to buy a good made in Japan, such as a Nintendo 
Wii. As a result of the Wii purchase, U.S. imports increase. The software export and 
the Wii import represent balanced trade. Because exports and imports increase by 
the same amount, net exports are unchanged. In this case, no American ends up 
acquiring a foreign asset and no foreigner ends up acquiring a U.S. asset, so there 
is also no impact on U.S. net capital outflow.

A final possibility is that you go to a local bank to exchange your 10,000 yen for 
U.S. dollars. But this doesn’t change the situation because the bank now has to do 
something with the 10,000 yen. It can buy Japanese assets (a U.S. net capital out­
flow); it can buy a Japanese good (a U.S. import); or it can sell the yen to another 
American who wants to make such a transaction. In the end, U.S. net exports must 
equal U.S. net capital outflow. 
This example all started when a U.S. programmer sold some software abroad, 
but the story is much the same when Americans buy goods and services from other 
countries. For example, if Walmart buys $50 million of clothing from China and 
sells it to American consumers, something must happen to that $50 million. One 
possibility is that China could use the $50 million to invest in the U.S. economy. 
This capital inflow from China might take the form of Chinese purchases of U.S. 
government bonds. In this case, the sale of the clothing reduces U.S. net exports, 
and the sale of bonds reduces U.S. net capital outflow. Alternatively, China could 
use the $50 million to buy a plane from Boeing, the U.S. aircraft manufacturer. In 
this case, the U.S. import of clothing balances the U.S. export of aircraft, so net 
exports and net capital outflow are both unchanged. In all cases, the transaction 
has the same effect on net exports and net capital outflow.
We can summarize these conclusions for the economy as a whole.
• 	 When a nation is running a trade surplus (NX . 0), it is selling more goods 
and services to foreigners than it is buying from them. What is it doing 
with the foreign currency it receives from the net sale of goods and services 
abroad? It must be using it to buy foreign assets. Capital is flowing out of 
the country (NCO . 0).
• 	 When a nation is running a trade deficit (NX , 0), it is buying more goods 
and services from foreigners than it is selling to them. How is it financing 
the net purchase of these goods and services in world markets? It must be 
selling assets abroad. Capital is flowing into the country (NCO , 0).
The international flow of goods and services and the international flow of capital 
are two sides of the same coin.
Saving, Investment, and Their Relationship  
to the International Flows
A nation’s saving and investment are crucial to its long-run economic growth. 
As we have seen earlier in this book, saving and investment are equal in a closed 
economy. But matters are not as simple in an open economy. Let’s now consider 
how saving and investment are related to the international flows of goods and 
capital as measured by net exports and net capital outflow.
	
As you may recall, the term net exports appeared earlier in the book when 
we discussed the components of gross domestic product. The economy’s gross 
domestic product (Y) is divided among four components: consumption (C), 
investment (I), government purchases (G), and net exports (NX). We write this as
Y = C + I + G + NX.
Total expenditure on the economy’s output of goods and services is the sum 
of expenditure on consumption, investment, government purchases, and net 
exports. Because each dollar of expenditure is placed into one of these four com­
ponents, this equation is an accounting identity: It must be true because of the 
way the variables are defined and measured.

Recall that national saving is the income of the nation that is left after paying 
for current consumption and government purchases. National saving (S) equals 
Y – C – G. If we rearrange the equation to reflect this fact, we obtain
Y – C – G = I + NX
	
S = I + NX.
Because net exports (NX) also equal net capital outflow (NCO), we can write this 
equation as
	
S =

This equation shows that a nation’s saving must equal its domestic investment 
plus its net capital outflow. In other words, when U.S. citizens save a dollar of 
their income for the future, that dollar can be used to finance accumulation of 
domestic capital or it can be used to finance the purchase of capital abroad.
This equation should look somewhat familiar. Earlier in the book, when we 
analyzed the role of the financial system, we considered this identity for the spe­
cial case of a closed economy. In a closed economy, net capital outflow is zero 
(NCO = 0), so saving equals investment (S = I). By contrast, an open economy has 
two uses for its saving: domestic investment and net capital outflow.
As before, we can view the financial system as standing between the two sides 
of this identity. For example, suppose the Smith family decides to save some of 
its income for retirement. This decision contributes to national saving, the left side 
of our equation. If the Smiths deposit their saving in a mutual fund, the mutual 
fund may use some of the deposit to buy stock issued by General Motors, which 
uses the proceeds to build a factory in Ohio. In addition, the mutual fund may 
use some of the Smiths’ deposit to buy stock issued by Toyota, which uses the 
proceeds to build a factory in Osaka. These transactions show up on the right 
side of the equation. From the standpoint of U.S. accounting, the General Motors 
expenditure on a new factory is domestic investment, and the purchase of Toyota 
stock by a U.S. resident is net capital outflow. Thus, all saving in the U.S. economy 
shows up as investment in the U.S. economy or as U.S. net capital outflow.
The bottom line is that saving, investment, and international capital flows are 
inextricably linked. When a nation’s saving exceeds its domestic investment, its 
net capital outflow is positive, indicating that the nation is using some of its sav­
ing to buy assets abroad. When a nation’s domestic investment exceeds its saving, 
its net capital outflow is negative, indicating that foreigners are financing some of 
this investment by purchasing domestic assets.
Summing Up
Table 1 summarizes many of the ideas presented so far in this chapter. It describes 
the three possibilities for an open economy: a country with a trade deficit, a coun­
try with balanced trade, and a country with a trade surplus.
Consider first a country with a trade surplus. By definition, a trade surplus 
means that the value of exports exceeds the value of imports. Because net exports 
are exports minus imports, net exports NX are greater than zero. As a result, 
income Y = C + I + G + NX must be greater than domestic spending C + I + G. 
But if income Y is more than spending C + I + G, then saving S = Y – C – G must 
be more than investment I. Because the country is saving more than it is investing,

it must be sending some of its saving abroad. That is, the net capital outflow must 
be greater than zero.
The converse logic applies to a country with a trade deficit (such as the U.S. econ­
omy in recent years). By definition, a trade deficit means that the value of exports 
is less than the value of imports. Because net exports are exports minus imports, 
net exports NX are negative. Thus, income Y = C + I + G + NX must be less than 
domestic spending C + I + G. But if income Y is less than spending C + I + G, then 
saving S = Y – C – G must be less than investment I. Because the country is invest­
ing more than it is saving, it must be financing some domestic investment by selling 
assets abroad. That is, the net capital outflow must be negative.
A country with balanced trade is between these cases. Exports equal imports, 
so net exports are zero. Income equals domestic spending, and saving equals 
investment. The net capital outflow equals zero.
Is the U.S. Trade Deficit a National Problem?
You may have heard the press call the United States “the world’s largest debtor.” 
The nation earned that description by borrowing heavily in world financial mar­
kets during the past three decades to finance large trade deficits. Why did the 
United States do this, and should this event give Americans reason to worry?
	
To answer these questions, let’s see what the macroeconomic accounting iden­
tities tell us about the U.S. economy. Panel (a) of Figure 2 shows national saving 
and domestic investment as a percentage of GDP since 1960. Panel (b) shows net 
capital outflow (that is, the trade balance) as a percentage of GDP. Notice that, as 
the identities require, net capital outflow always equals national saving minus 
domestic investment.
	
The figure shows a dramatic change beginning in the early 1980s. Before 1980, 
national saving and domestic investment were close, and so net capital outflow 
was small. Yet after 1980, national saving fell substantially below investment, and 
net capital outflow became a large negative number. That is, there was a capital 
inflow: Foreigners were buying more capital assets in the United States than 
Americans were buying abroad. The United States was going into debt.
	
History shows that changes in capital flows arise sometimes from changes in 
saving and sometimes from changes in investment. From 1980 to 1987, the flow 
of capital into the United States went from 0.5 to 3.1 percent of GDP. This 2.6 
percentage point change is largely attributable to a fall in saving of 3.2 percentage 
points. This decline in national saving, in turn, is often explained by the decline in 
public saving—that is, the increase in the government budget deficit.

A different story explains the events of the following decade. From 1991 to 
2000, the capital flow into the United States went from 0.5 to 3.9 percent of GDP. 
None of this 3.4 percentage point change is attributable to a decline in saving; in 
fact, saving increased over this time, as the government’s budget switched from 
deficit to surplus. But investment went from 13.4 to 17.7 percent of GDP, as the 
economy enjoyed a boom in information technology and many firms were eager 
to make these high-tech investments.

From 2000 to 2006, the capital flow into the United States increased further, 
reaching a record 5.7 percent of GDP. The investment boom abated after 2000, but 
once again, the federal government started running budget deficits, and national 
saving fell to extraordinarily low levels by historical standards.
	
This trend has reversed somewhat in recent years. From 2007 to 2009, the trade 
deficit shrank as the economy experienced a substantial decline in housing prices 
and a deep recession, both of which led to a dramatic fall in investment.
	
Are these trade deficits a problem for the U.S. economy? To answer this ques­
tion, it is important to keep an eye on the nation’s saving and investment.
	
Consider first a trade deficit induced by a fall in saving, as occurred during the 
1980s and the early 2000s. Lower saving means that the nation is putting away 
less of its income to provide for its future. Once national saving has fallen, how­
ever, there is no reason to deplore the resulting trade deficits. If national saving 
fell without inducing a trade deficit, investment in the United States would have 
to fall. This fall in investment, in turn, would adversely affect the growth in the 
capital stock, labor productivity, and real wages. In other words, given that U.S. 
saving has declined, it is better to have foreigners invest in the U.S. economy than 
no one at all.
	
Now consider a trade deficit induced by an investment boom, such as the trade 
deficits of the 1990s. In this case, the economy is borrowing from abroad to finance 
the purchase of new capital goods. If this additional capital provides a good 
return in the form of higher production of goods and services, then the economy 
should be able to handle the debts that are being accumulated. On the other hand, 
if the investment projects fail to yield the expected returns, the debts will look less 
desirable, at least with the benefit of hindsight.
	
There is no simple and correct answer to the question posed in the title to this 
case study. Just as an individual can go into debt in either a prudent or a profligate 
manner, so can a nation. The trade deficit is not a problem in itself, but sometimes 
it can be a symptom of a problem. ■

The Prices for International Transactions:  
Real and Nominal Exchange Rates
So far, we have discussed measures of the flow of goods and services and the 
flow of capital across a nation’s border. In addition to these quantity variables, 
macroeconomists also study variables that measure the prices at which these 
international transactions take place. Just as the price in any market serves the 
important role of coordinating buyers and sellers in that market, international 
prices help coordinate the decisions of consumers and producers as they interact 
in world markets. Here we discuss the two most important international prices: 
the nominal and real exchange rates.
Nominal Exchange Rates
The nominal exchange rate is the rate at which a person can trade the currency 
of one country for the currency of another. For example, if you go to a bank, you 
might see a posted exchange rate of 80 yen per dollar. If you give the bank one 
nominal exchange 
rate
the rate at which a person 
can trade the currency 
of one country for the 
currency of another

U.S. dollar, it will give you 80 Japanese yen; and if you give the bank 80 Japanese 
yen, it will give you one U.S. dollar. (In actuality, the bank will post slightly dif­
ferent prices for buying and selling yen. The difference gives the bank some profit 
for offering this service. For our purposes here, we can ignore these differences.)
An exchange rate can always be expressed in two ways. If the exchange rate is 
80 yen per dollar, it is also 1/80 (= 0.0125) dollar per yen. Throughout this book, 
we always express the nominal exchange rate as units of foreign currency per U.S. 
dollar, such as 80 yen per dollar.
If the exchange rate changes so that a dollar buys more foreign currency, that 
change is called an appreciation of the dollar. If the exchange rate changes so that 
a dollar buys less foreign currency, that change is called a depreciation of the dollar.

of a currency as measured

FYI
 The Euro
Y
ou may have once heard of, or perhaps even 
seen, currencies such as the French franc, 
the German mark, or the Italian lira. These types 
of money no longer exist. During the 1990s, 
many European nations decided to give up their 
national currencies and use a common currency 
called the euro. The euro started circulating on 
January 1, 2002. Monetary policy for the euro 
area is now set by the European Central Bank 
(ECB), with representatives from all of the par-
ticipating countries. The ECB issues the euro and 
controls the supply of this money, much as the 
Federal Reserve controls the supply of dollars in 
the U.S. economy.
	
Why did these countries adopt a common 
currency? One benefit of a common currency is that it makes trade 
easier. Imagine that each of the fifty U.S. states had a different 
currency. Every time you crossed a state border, you would need 
to change your money and perform the kind of exchange-rate 
calculations discussed in the text. This would be inconvenient, 
and it might deter you from buying goods and services outside 
your own state. The countries of Europe decided that as their 
economies became more integrated, it would be better to avoid 
this inconvenience.
	
To some extent, the adoption of a common currency in Europe 
was a political decision based on concerns beyond the scope of 
standard economics. Some advocates of the 
euro wanted to reduce nationalistic feelings and 
to make Europeans appreciate more fully their 
shared history and destiny. A single money for 
most of the continent, they argued, would help 
achieve this goal.
	
There are, however, costs of choosing a com-
mon currency. If the nations of Europe have only 
one money, they can have only one monetary policy. 
If they disagree about what monetary policy is best, 
they will have to reach some kind of agreement, 
rather than each going its own way. Because adopt-
ing a single money has both benefits and costs, 
there is debate among economists about whether 
Europe’s adoption of the euro was a good decision.
	
In 2010, the euro question heated up as several European 
nations dealt with a variety of economic difficulties. Greece, in 
particular, had run up a large government debt and found itself 
facing possible default. As a result, it had to raise taxes and 
cut back government spending substantially. Some observers 
suggested that dealing with these problems would have been 
easier if the government had an additional tool—a national 
monetary policy. The possibility of Greece’s leaving the euro 
area and reintroducing its own currency was even discussed. 
As this book was going to press, however, that outcome looked 
unlikely.

For example, when the exchange rate rises from 80 to 90 yen per dollar, the dol­
lar is said to appreciate. At the same time, because a Japanese yen now buys less 
of the U.S. currency, the yen is said to depreciate. When the exchange rate falls 
from 80 to 70 yen per dollar, the dollar is said to depreciate, and the yen is said 
to appreciate.
At times, you may have heard the media report that the dollar is either “strong” 
or “weak.” These descriptions usually refer to recent changes in the nominal 
exchange rate. When a currency appreciates, it is said to strengthen because it can 
then buy more foreign currency. Similarly, when a currency depreciates, it is said 
to weaken.
For any country, there are many nominal exchange rates. The U.S. dollar can 
be used to buy Japanese yen, British pounds, Mexican pesos, and so on. When 
economists study changes in the exchange rate, they often use indexes that aver­
age these many exchange rates. Just as the consumer price index turns the many 
prices in the economy into a single measure of the price level, an exchange rate 
index turns these many exchange rates into a single measure of the international 
value of a currency. So when economists talk about the dollar appreciating or 
depreciating, they often are referring to an exchange rate index that takes into 
account many individual exchange rates.
Real Exchange Rates
The real exchange rate is the rate at which a person can trade the goods and ser­
vices of one country for the goods and services of another. For example, if you go 
shopping and find that a pound of Swiss cheese is twice as expensive as a pound 
of American cheese, the real exchange rate is ½ pound of Swiss cheese per pound 
of American cheese. Notice that, like the nominal exchange rate, we express the 
real exchange rate as units of the foreign item per unit of the domestic item. But 
in this instance, the item is a good rather than a currency.
Real and nominal exchange rates are closely related. To see how, consider 
an example. Suppose that a bushel of American rice sells for $100, and a bushel 
of Japanese rice sells for 16,000 yen. What is the real exchange rate between 
American and Japanese rice? To answer this question, we must first use the nomi­
nal exchange rate to convert the prices into a common currency. If the nominal 
exchange rate is 80 yen per dollar, then a price for American rice of $100 per 
bushel is equivalent to 8,000 yen per bushel. American rice is half as expensive 
as Japanese rice. The real exchange rate is ½ bushel of Japanese rice per bushel of 
American rice.
We can summarize this calculation for the real exchange rate with the follow­
ing formula:
Real exchange rate = Nominal exchange rate × Domestic price .
	
Foreign price
Using the numbers in our example, the formula applies as follows:
Real exchange rate = (80 yen/dollar) × ($100/bushel of American rice)
	
16,000 yen/bushel of Japanese rice
	
=  8000 yen/bushel of American rice
	
16,000 yen/bushel of Japanese rice
	
= ½  bushel of Japanese rice/bushel of American rice.

Thus, the real exchange rate depends on the nominal exchange rate and on the 
prices of goods in the two countries measured in the local currencies.
Why does the real exchange rate matter? As you might guess, the real exchange 
rate is a key determinant of how much a country exports and imports. When 
Uncle Ben’s, Inc., is deciding whether to buy U.S. rice or Japanese rice to put into 
its boxes, for example, it will ask which rice is cheaper. The real exchange rate 
gives the answer. As another example, imagine that you are deciding whether 
to take a seaside vacation in Miami, Florida, or in Cancún, Mexico. You might 
ask your travel agent the price of a hotel room in Miami (measured in dollars), 
the price of a hotel room in Cancún (measured in pesos), and the exchange rate 
between pesos and dollars. If you decide where to vacation by comparing costs, 
you are basing your decision on the real exchange rate.
When studying an economy as a whole, macroeconomists focus on overall 
prices rather than the prices of individual items. That is, to measure the real 
exchange rate, they use price indexes, such as the consumer price index, which 
measure the price of a basket of goods and services. By using a price index for a 
U.S. basket (P), a price index for a foreign basket (P *), and the nominal exchange 
rate between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies (e), we can compute the overall 
real exchange rate between the United States and other countries as follows:
Real exchange rate = (e × P)/P *.
This real exchange rate measures the price of a basket of goods and services avail­
able domestically relative to a basket of goods and services available abroad.
As we examine more fully in the next chapter, a country’s real exchange rate is 
a key determinant of its net exports of goods and services. A depreciation (fall) in 
the U.S. real exchange rate means that U.S. goods have become cheaper relative 
to foreign goods. This change encourages consumers both at home and abroad 
to buy more U.S. goods and fewer goods from other countries. As a result, U.S. 
exports rise, and U.S. imports fall; both of these changes raise U.S. net exports. 
Conversely, an appreciation (rise) in the U.S. real exchange rate means that U.S. 
goods have become more expensive compared to foreign goods, so U.S. net 
exports fall.
Quick Quiz  Define nominal exchange rate and real exchange rate, and explain 
how they are related. • If the nominal exchange rate goes from 100 to 120 yen per 
dollar, has the dollar appreciated or depreciated?
A First Theory of Exchange-Rate Determination:  
Purchasing-Power Parity
Exchange rates vary substantially over time. In 1970, a U.S. dollar could be used 
to buy 3.65 German marks or 627 Italian lira. In 1998, as both Germany and Italy 
were getting ready to adopt the euro as their common currency, a U.S. dollar 
bought 1.76 German marks or 1,737 Italian lira. In other words, over this period, 
the value of the dollar fell by more than half compared to the mark, while it more 
than doubled compared to the lira.
What explains these large and opposite changes? Economists have developed 
many models to explain how exchange rates are determined, each emphasizing 
just some of the many forces at work. Here we develop the simplest theory of

exchange rates, called purchasing-power parity. This theory states that a unit 
of any given currency should be able to buy the same quantity of goods in all 
countries. Many economists believe that purchasing-power parity describes the 
forces that determine exchange rates in the long run. We now consider the logic 
on which this long-run theory of exchange rates is based, as well as the theory’s 
implications and limitations.
The Basic Logic of Purchasing-Power Parity
The theory of purchasing-power parity is based on a principle called the law of 
one price. This law asserts that a good must sell for the same price in all locations. 
Otherwise, there would be opportunities for profit left unexploited. For example, 
suppose that coffee beans sold for less in Seattle than in Boston. A person could 
buy coffee in Seattle for, say, $4 a pound and then sell it in Boston for $5 a pound, 
making a profit of $1 per pound from the difference in price. The process of tak­
ing advantage of price differences for the same item in different markets is called 
arbitrage. In our example, as people took advantage of this arbitrage opportunity, 
they would increase the demand for coffee in Seattle and increase the supply in 
Boston. The price of coffee would rise in Seattle (in response to greater demand) 
and fall in Boston (in response to greater supply). This process would continue 
until, eventually, the prices were the same in the two markets.
Now consider how the law of one price applies to the international marketplace. 
If a dollar (or any other currency) could buy more coffee in the United States than 
in Japan, international traders could profit by buying coffee in the United States 
and selling it in Japan. This export of coffee from the United States to Japan would 
drive up the U.S. price of coffee and drive down the Japanese price. Conversely, 
if a dollar could buy more coffee in Japan than in the United States, traders could 
buy coffee in Japan and sell it in the United States. This import of coffee into the 
United States from Japan would drive down the U.S. price of coffee and drive up 
the Japanese price. In the end, the law of one price tells us that a dollar must buy 
the same amount of coffee in all countries.
This logic leads us to the theory of purchasing-power parity. According to this 
theory, a currency must have the same purchasing power in all countries. That is, 
a U.S. dollar must buy the same quantity of goods in the United States and Japan, 
and a Japanese yen must buy the same quantity of goods in Japan and the United 
States. Indeed, the name of this theory describes it well. Parity means equality, and 
purchasing power refers to the value of money in terms of the quantity of goods 
it can buy. Purchasing-power parity states that a unit of a currency must have the 
same real value in every country.
Implications of Purchasing-Power Parity
What does the theory of purchasing-power parity say about exchange rates? It 
tells us that the nominal exchange rate between the currencies of two countries 
depends on the price levels in those countries. If a dollar buys the same quantity 
of goods in the United States (where prices are measured in dollars) as in Japan 
(where prices are measured in yen), then the number of yen per dollar must reflect 
the prices of goods in the United States and Japan. For example, if a pound of cof­
fee costs 500 yen in Japan and $5 in the United States, then the nominal exchange 
rate must be 100 yen per dollar (500 yen/$5 = 100 yen per dollar). Otherwise, the 
purchasing power of the dollar would not be the same in the two countries.
To see more fully how this works, it is helpful to use just a bit of mathematics. 
Suppose that P is the price of a basket of goods in the United States (measured in 
purchasing-power

rates whereby a unit of 
any given currency should 
be able to buy the same 
quantity of goods in all

dollars), P * is the price of a basket of goods in Japan (measured in yen), and e is 
the nominal exchange rate (the number of yen a dollar can buy). Now consider 
the quantity of goods a dollar can buy at home and abroad. At home, the price 
level is P, so the purchasing power of $1 at home is 1/P. That is, a dollar can buy 
1/P quantity of goods. Abroad, a dollar can be exchanged into e units of foreign 
currency, which in turn have purchasing power e/P *. For the purchasing power of 
a dollar to be the same in the two countries, it must be the case that
1/P = e/P *.
With rearrangement, this equation becomes
1 = eP/P *.
Notice that the left side of this equation is a constant, and the right side is the 
real exchange rate. Thus, if the purchasing power of the dollar is always the same at 
home and abroad, then the real exchange rate—the relative price of domestic and foreign 
goods—cannot change.
To see the implication of this analysis for the nominal exchange rate, we can 
rearrange the last equation to solve for the nominal exchange rate:
e = P */P.
That is, the nominal exchange rate equals the ratio of the foreign price level (mea­
sured in units of the foreign currency) to the domestic price level (measured in 
units of the domestic currency). According to the theory of purchasing-power parity, 
the nominal exchange rate between the currencies of two countries must reflect the price 
levels in those countries.
A key implication of this theory is that nominal exchange rates change when 
price levels change. As we saw in the preceding chapter, the price level in any 
country adjusts to bring the quantity of money supplied and the quantity of 
money demanded into balance. Because the nominal exchange rate depends on 
the price levels, it also depends on the money supply and money demand in each 
country. When a central bank in any country increases the money supply and 
causes the price level to rise, it also causes that country’s currency to depreciate 
relative to other currencies in the world. In other words, when the central bank 
prints large quantities of money, that money loses value both in terms of the goods and 
services it can buy and in terms of the amount of other currencies it can buy.
We can now answer the question that began this section: Why did the U.S. 
dollar lose value compared to the German mark and gain value compared to the 
Italian lira? The answer is that Germany pursued a less inflationary monetary 
policy than the United States, and Italy pursued a more inflationary monetary 
policy. From 1970 to 1998, inflation in the United States was 5.3 percent per year. 
By contrast, inflation was 3.5 percent in Germany and 9.6 percent in Italy. As U.S. 
prices rose relative to German prices, the value of the dollar fell relative to the 
mark. Similarly, as U.S. prices fell relative to Italian prices, the value of the dollar 
rose relative to the lira.
Germany and Italy now have a common currency—the euro. This means 
that the two countries share a single monetary policy and that the inflation rates 
in the two countries will be closely linked. But the historical lessons of the lira 
and the mark will apply to the euro as well. Whether the U.S. dollar buys more or 
fewer euros twenty years from now than it does today depends on whether the 
European Central Bank produces more or less inflation in Europe than the Federal 
Reserve does in the United States.

The Nominal Exchange Rate during a Hyperinflation
Macroeconomists can only rarely conduct controlled experiments. Most often, 
they must glean what they can from the natural experiments that history gives 
them. One natural experiment is hyperinflation—the high inflation that arises 
when a government turns to the printing press to pay for large amounts of gov­
ernment spending. Because hyperinflations are so extreme, they illustrate some 
basic economic principles with clarity.
	
Consider the German hyperinflation of the early 1920s. Figure 3 shows the 
German money supply, the German price level, and the nominal exchange rate 
(measured as U.S. cents per German mark) for that period. Notice that these 
series move closely together. When the supply of money starts growing quickly, 
the price level also takes off, and the German mark depreciates. When the money 
supply stabilizes, so do the price level and the exchange rate.
	
The pattern shown in this figure appears during every hyperinflation. It leaves 
no doubt that there is a fundamental link among money, prices, and the nominal 
Figure 3
Money, Prices, and the 
Nominal Exchange Rate 
during the German 
Hyperinflation
This figure shows the money supply, the price level, and the nominal exchange rate 
(measured as U.S. cents per mark) for the German hyperinflation from January 1921 to 
December 1924. Notice how similarly these three variables move. When the quantity 
of money started growing quickly, the price level followed, and the mark depreciated 
relative to the dollar. When the German central bank stabilized the money supply, the 
price level and exchange rate stabilized as well.

exchange rate. The quantity theory of money discussed in the previous chapter 
explains how the money supply affects the price level. The theory of purchasing-
power parity discussed here explains how the price level affects the nominal 
exchange rate.  ■
Limitations of Purchasing-Power Parity
Purchasing-power parity provides a simple model of how exchange rates are 
determined. For understanding many economic phenomena, the theory works 
well. In particular, it can explain many long-term trends, such as the depreciation 
of the U.S. dollar against the German mark and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against the Italian lira. It can also explain the major changes in exchange rates that 
occur during hyperinflations.
Yet the theory of purchasing‑power parity is not completely accurate. That is, 
exchange rates do not always move to ensure that a dollar has the same real value 
in all countries all the time. There are two reasons the theory of purchasing-power 
parity does not always hold in practice.
The first reason is that many goods are not easily traded. Imagine, for instance, 
that haircuts are more expensive in Paris than in New York. International travel­
ers might avoid getting their haircuts in Paris, and some haircutters might move 
from New York to Paris. Yet such arbitrage would be too limited to eliminate the 
differences in prices. Thus, the deviation from purchasing-power parity might 
persist, and a dollar (or euro) would continue to buy less of a haircut in Paris than 
in New York.
The second reason that purchasing-power parity does not always hold is that 
even tradable goods are not always perfect substitutes when they are produced in 
different countries. For example, some consumers prefer German cars, and others 
prefer American cars. Moreover, consumer tastes can change over time. If German 
cars suddenly become more popular, the increase in demand will drive up the 
price of German cars compared to American cars. Despite this difference in prices 
in the two markets, there might be no opportunity for profitable arbitrage because 
consumers do not view the two cars as equivalent.
Thus, both because some goods are not tradable and because some tradable 
goods are not perfect substitutes with their foreign counterparts, purchasing-
power parity is not a perfect theory of exchange-rate determination. For these 
reasons, real exchange rates fluctuate over time. Nonetheless, the theory of pur­
chasing‑power parity does provide a useful first step in understanding exchange 
rates. The basic logic is persuasive: As the real exchange rate drifts from the level 
predicted by purchasing‑power parity, people have greater incentive to move 
goods across national borders. Even if the forces of purchasing‑power parity 
do not completely fix the real exchange rate, they provide a reason to expect 
that changes in the real exchange rate are most often small or temporary. As a 
result, large and persistent movements in nominal exchange rates typically reflect 
changes in price levels at home and abroad.
The Hamburger Standard
When economists apply the theory of purchasing-power parity to explain 
exchange rates, they need data on the prices of a basket of goods available in 
different countries. One analysis of this sort is conducted by The Economist, an

international newsmagazine. The magazine occasionally collects data on a bas­
ket of goods consisting of “two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, 
pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun.” It’s called the “Big Mac” and is sold by 
McDonald’s around the world.
Once we have the prices of Big Macs in two countries denominated in the 
local currencies, we can compute the exchange rate predicted by the theory of 
purchasing-power parity. The predicted exchange rate is the one that makes the 
cost of the Big Mac the same in the two countries. For instance, if the price of a 
Big Mac is $3 in the United States and 300 yen in Japan, purchasing-power parity 
would predict an exchange rate of 100 yen per dollar.
How well does purchasing-power parity work when applied using Big Mac 
prices? Here are some examples from July 2009, when the price of a Big Mac was 
$3.57 in the United States:

You can see that the predicted and actual exchange rates are not exactly the 
same. After all, international arbitrage in Big Macs is not easy. Yet the two 
exchange rates are usually in the same ballpark. Purchasing-power parity is 
not a precise theory of exchange rates, but it often provides a reasonable first 
approximation.  ■

has had low inflation. What do you predict has happened to the number of Mexican

Conclusion
The purpose of this chapter has been to develop some basic concepts that mac­
roeconomists use to study open economies. You should now understand how 
a nation’s trade balance is related to the international flow of capital and how 
national saving can differ from domestic investment in an open economy. You 
should understand that when a nation is running a trade surplus, it must be send­
ing capital abroad, and that when it is running a trade deficit, it must be experi­
encing a capital inflow. You should also understand the meaning of the nominal 
and real exchange rates, as well as the implications and limitations of purchasing-
power parity as a theory of how exchange rates are determined.
The macroeconomic variables defined here offer a starting point for analyzing 
an open economy’s interactions with the rest of the world. In the next chapter, we 
develop a model that can explain what determines these variables. We can then 
discuss how various events and policies affect a country’s trade balance and the 
rate at which nations make exchanges in world markets.

• Net exports are the value of domestic goods and 
services sold abroad (exports) minus the value 
of foreign goods and services sold domestically 
(imports). Net capital outflow is the acquisition 
of foreign assets by domestic residents (capital 
outflow) minus the acquisition of domestic assets 
by foreigners (capital inflow). Because every 
international transaction involves an exchange 
of an asset for a good or service, an economy’s 
net capital outflow always equals its net exports.
• An economy’s saving can be used either to 
finance investment at home or to buy assets 
abroad. Thus, national saving equals domestic 
investment plus net capital outflow.
• The nominal exchange rate is the relative price 
of the currency of two countries, and the real 
exchange rate is the relative price of the goods 
and services of two countries. When the nominal 
exchange rate changes so that each dollar buys 
more foreign currency, the dollar is said to appre-
ciate or strengthen. When the nominal exchange 
rate changes so that each dollar buys less foreign 
currency, the dollar is said to depreciate or weaken.
• According to the theory of purchasing-power 
parity, a dollar (or a unit of any other currency) 
should be able to buy the same quantity of goods 
in all countries. This theory implies that the nom­
inal exchange rate between the currencies of two 
countries should reflect the price levels in those 
countries. As a result, countries with relatively 
high inflation should have depreciating curren­
cies, and countries with relatively low inflation 
should have appreciating currencies.
