f you check the labels on the clothes you are now wearing, you will probably 
find that some of your clothes were made in another country.  A century ago, 
the textile and clothing industry was a major part of the U.S. economy, but 
that is no longer the case. Faced with foreign competitors that can produce 
quality goods at low cost, many U.S. firms have found it increasingly difficult 
to produce and sell textiles and clothing at a profit.  As a result, they have laid 
off their workers and shut down their factories.  Today, much of the textiles and 
clothing that Americans consume are imported.
The story of the textile industry raises important questions for economic policy: 
How does international trade affect economic well-being? Who gains and who 
loses from free trade among countries, and how do the gains compare to the 
losses? 
Chapter 3 introduced the study of international trade by applying the principle 
of comparative advantage. According to this principle, all countries can benefit

from trading with one another because trade allows each country to specialize in 
doing what it does best. But the analysis in Chapter 3 was incomplete. It did not 
explain how the international marketplace achieves these gains from trade or how 
the gains are distributed among various economic participants.
We now return to the study of international trade and take up these questions. 
Over the past several chapters, we have developed many tools for analyzing 
how markets work: supply, demand, equilibrium, consumer surplus, producer 
surplus, and so on. With these tools, we can learn more about how international 
trade affects economic well-being.
The Determinants of Trade
Consider the market for textiles. The textile market is well suited to examining 
the gains and losses from international trade: Textiles are made in many countries 
around the world, and there is much world trade in textiles. Moreover, the textile 
market is one in which policymakers often consider (and sometimes implement) 
trade restrictions to protect domestic producers from foreign competitors. We 
examine here the textile market in the imaginary country of Isoland. 
The Equilibrium without Trade
As our story begins, the Isolandian textile market is isolated from the rest of the 
world. By government decree, no one in Isoland is allowed to import or export 
textiles, and the penalty for violating the decree is so large that no one dares try. 
Because there is no international trade, the market for textiles in Isoland con-
sists solely of Isolandian buyers and sellers. As Figure 1 shows, the domestic price 
adjusts to balance the quantity supplied by domestic sellers and the quantity 
demanded by domestic buyers. The figure shows the consumer and producer sur-
plus in the equilibrium without trade. The sum of consumer and producer surplus 
measures the total benefits that buyers and sellers receive from participating in 
the textile market.

surplus in an equilibrium without

CHAPTER 9    Application: International Trade
Now suppose that, in an election upset, Isoland elects a new president. The 
president campaigned on a platform of “change” and promised the voters bold 
new ideas. Her first act is to assemble a team of economists to evaluate Isolandian 
trade policy. She asks them to report on three questions:
• 	 If the government allows Isolandians to import and export textiles, what 
will happen to the price of textiles and the quantity of textiles sold in the 
domestic textile market? 
• 	 Who will gain from free trade in textiles and who will lose, and will the 
gains exceed the losses?
• 	 Should a tariff (a tax on textile imports) be part of the new trade policy?
After reviewing supply and demand in their favorite textbook (this one, of 
course), the Isolandian economics team begins its analysis. 
The World Price and Comparative Advantage
The first issue our economists take up is whether Isoland is likely to become a 
textile importer or a textile exporter. In other words, if free trade is allowed, will 
Isolandians end up buying or selling textiles in world markets?
To answer this question, the economists compare the current Isolandian 
price of textiles to the price of textiles in other countries. We call the price 
prevailing in world markets the world price. If the world price of textiles is 
higher than the domestic price, then Isoland will export textiles once trade 
is permitted. Isolandian textile producers will be eager to receive the higher 
prices available abroad and will start selling their textiles to buyers in other 
countries. Conversely, if the world price of textiles is lower than the domestic 
price, then Isoland will import textiles. Because foreign sellers offer a better 
price, Isolandian textile consumers will quickly start buying textiles from other 
countries.
In essence, comparing the world price and the domestic price before trade 
indicates whether Isoland has a comparative advantage in producing textiles. 
The domestic price reflects the opportunity cost of textiles: It tells us how much 
an Isolandian must give up to obtain one unit of textiles. If the domestic price is 
low, the cost of producing textiles in Isoland is low, suggesting that Isoland has 
a comparative advantage in producing textiles relative to the rest of the world. If 
the domestic price is high, then the cost of producing textiles in Isoland is high, 
suggesting that foreign countries have a comparative advantage in producing 
textiles. 
As we saw in Chapter 3, trade among nations is ultimately based on compara-
tive advantage. That is, trade is beneficial because it allows each nation to special-
ize in doing what it does best. By comparing the world price and the domestic 
price before trade, we can determine whether Isoland is better or worse at produc-
ing textiles than the rest of the world.

you can buy a wool suit for 3 ounces of gold. Meanwhile, in neighboring countries, 
you can buy the same suit for 2 ounces of gold. If Autarka were to allow free trade, 
would it import or export wool suits? Why?

PART Iii	
Markets and Welfare
The Winners and Losers from Trade
To analyze the welfare effects of free trade, the Isolandian economists begin with 
the assumption that Isoland is a small economy compared to the rest of the world. 
This small-economy assumption means that Isoland’s actions have little effect on 
world markets. Specifically, any change in Isoland’s trade policy will not affect 
the world price of textiles. The Isolandians are said to be price takers in the world 
economy. That is, they take the world price of textiles as given. Isoland can be an 
exporting country by selling textiles at this price or an importing country by buy-
ing textiles at this price. 
The small-economy assumption is not necessary to analyze the gains and losses 
from international trade. But the Isolandian economists know from experience 
(and from reading Chapter 2 of this book) that making simplifying assumptions 
is a key part of building a useful economic model. The assumption that Isoland 
is a small economy simplifies the analysis, and the basic lessons do not change in 
the more complicated case of a large economy.
The Gains and Losses of an Exporting Country
Figure 2 shows the Isolandian textile market when the domestic equilibrium 
price before trade is below the world price. Once trade is allowed, the domestic 
price rises to equal the world price. No seller of textiles would accept less than the 
world price, and no buyer would pay more than the world price.
Figure 2
International Trade in an Exporting 
Country
Once trade is allowed, the domestic price 
rises to equal the world price. The supply 
curve shows the quantity of textiles 
produced domestically, and the demand 
curve shows the quantity consumed 
domestically. Exports from Isoland equal 
the difference between the domestic 
quantity supplied and the domestic 
quantity demanded at the world price. 
Sellers are better off (producer surplus 
rises from C to B 1 C 1 D), and buyers 
are worse off (consumer surplus falls from 
A 1 B to A). Total surplus rises by an 
amount equal to area D, indicating that 
trade raises the economic well-being of 
the country as a whole.

CHAPTER 9    Application: International Trade
After the domestic price has risen to equal the world price, the domestic 
quantity supplied differs from the domestic quantity demanded. The supply 
curve shows the quantity of textiles supplied by Isolandian sellers. The demand 
curve shows the quantity of textiles demanded by Isolandian buyers. Because 
the domestic quantity supplied is greater than the domestic quantity demanded, 
Isoland sells textiles to other countries. Thus, Isoland becomes a textile exporter.
Although domestic quantity supplied and domestic quantity demanded differ, 
the textile market is still in equilibrium because there is now another participant 
in the market: the rest of the world. One can view the horizontal line at the world 
price as representing the rest of the world’s demand for textiles. This demand 
curve is perfectly elastic because Isoland, as a small economy, can sell as many 
textiles as it wants at the world price.
Now consider the gains and losses from opening up trade. Clearly, not every-
one benefits. Trade forces the domestic price to rise to the world price. Domestic 
producers of textiles are better off because they can now sell textiles at a higher 
price, but domestic consumers of textiles are worse off because they have to buy 
textiles at a higher price.
To measure these gains and losses, we look at the changes in consumer and 
producer surplus. Before trade is allowed, the price of textiles adjusts to balance 
domestic supply and domestic demand. Consumer surplus, the area between 
the demand curve and the before-trade price, is area A 1 B. Producer surplus, 
the area between the supply curve and the before-trade price, is area C. Total sur-
plus before trade, the sum of consumer and producer surplus, is area A1 B 1 C.
After trade is allowed, the domestic price rises to the world price. Consumer sur-
plus is reduced to area A (the area between the demand curve and the world price). 
Producer surplus is increased to area B 1 C 1 D (the area between the supply curve 
and the world price). Thus, total surplus with trade is area A 1 B 1 C 1 D.
These welfare calculations show who wins and who loses from trade in an 
exporting country. Sellers benefit because producer surplus increases by the area 
B 1 D. Buyers are worse off because consumer surplus decreases by the area B. 
Because the gains of sellers exceed the losses of buyers by the area D, total surplus 
in Isoland increases.
This analysis of an exporting country yields two conclusions:
• 	 When a country allows trade and becomes an exporter of a good, domestic 
producers of the good are better off, and domestic consumers of the good 
are worse off. 
• 	 Trade raises the economic well-being of a nation in the sense that the gains 
of the winners exceed the losses of the losers.
The Gains and Losses of an Importing Country
Now suppose that the domestic price before trade is above the world price. Once 
again, after trade is allowed, the domestic price must equal the world price. As 
Figure 3 shows, the domestic quantity supplied is less than the domestic quantity 
demanded. The difference between the domestic quantity demanded and the 
domestic quantity supplied is bought from other countries, and Isoland becomes 
a textile importer.
In this case, the horizontal line at the world price represents the supply of the 
rest of the world. This supply curve is perfectly elastic because Isoland is a small 
economy and, therefore, can buy as many textiles as it wants at the world price.

Markets and Welfare
Now consider the gains and losses from trade. Once again, not everyone bene-
fits. When trade forces the domestic price to fall, domestic consumers are better off 
(they can now buy textiles at a lower price), and domestic producers are worse off 
(they now have to sell textiles at a lower price). Changes in consumer and producer 
surplus measure the size of the gains and losses. Before trade, consumer surplus is 
area A, producer surplus is area B 1 C, and total surplus is area A 1 B 1 C. After 
trade is allowed, consumer surplus is area A 1 B 1 D, producer surplus is area C, 
and total surplus is area A 1 B 1 C 1 D. 
These welfare calculations show who wins and who loses from trade in an 
importing country. Buyers benefit because consumer surplus increases by the area 
B 1 D. Sellers are worse off because producer surplus falls by the area B. The gains 
of buyers exceed the losses of sellers, and total surplus increases by the area D.
This analysis of an importing country yields two conclusions parallel to those 
for an exporting country:
• 	 When a country allows trade and becomes an importer of a good, domestic 
consumers of the good are better off, and domestic producers of the good 
are worse off. 
• 	 Trade raises the economic well-being of a nation in the sense that the gains 
of the winners exceed the losses of the losers.
Having completed our analysis of trade, we can better understand one of the Ten 
Principles of Economics in Chapter 1: Trade can make everyone better off. If Isoland

CHAPTER 9    Application: International Trade
opens its textile market to international trade, the change will create winners and 
losers, regardless of whether Isoland ends up exporting or importing textiles. 
In either case, however, the gains of the winners would exceed the losses of the 
losers, so the winners could compensate the losers and still be better off. In this 
sense, trade can make everyone better off. But will trade make everyone better off? 
Probably not. In practice, compensation for the losers from international trade is 
rare. Without such compensation, opening an economy to international trade is 
a policy that expands the size of the economic pie, while perhaps leaving some 
participants in the economy with a smaller slice.
We can now see why the debate over trade policy is often contentious. 
Whenever a policy creates winners and losers, the stage is set for a political battle. 
Nations sometimes fail to enjoy the gains from trade because the losers from free 
trade are better organized than the winners. The losers may turn their cohesive-
ness into political clout, lobbying for trade restrictions such as tariffs or import 
quotas.
The Effects of a Tariff
The Isolandian economists next consider the effects of a tariff—a tax on imported 
goods. The economists quickly realize that a tariff on textiles will have no effect 
if Isoland becomes a textile exporter. If no one in Isoland is interested in import-
ing textiles, a tax on textile imports is irrelevant. The tariff matters only if Isoland 
becomes a textile importer. Concentrating their attention on this case, the econo-
mists compare welfare with and without the tariff.
Figure 4 shows the Isolandian market for textiles. Under free trade, the domes-
tic price equals the world price. A tariff raises the price of imported textiles 
above the world price by the amount of the tariff. Domestic suppliers of textiles, 
who compete with suppliers of imported textiles, can now sell their textiles for 
the world price plus the amount of the tariff. Thus, the price of textiles—both 
imported and domestic—rises by the amount of the tariff and is, therefore, closer 
to the price that would prevail without trade.
The change in price affects the behavior of domestic buyers and sellers. Because 
the tariff raises the price of textiles, it reduces the domestic quantity demanded 
from Q1
D to Q2
D and raises the domestic quantity supplied from Q1
S to Q2
S. Thus, the 
tariff reduces the quantity of imports and moves the domestic market closer to its equilib-
rium without trade. 
Now consider the gains and losses from the tariff. Because the tariff raises the 
domestic price, domestic sellers are better off, and domestic buyers are worse off. 
In addition, the government raises revenue. To measure these gains and losses, 
we look at the changes in consumer surplus, producer surplus, and government 
revenue. These changes are summarized in the table in Figure 4. 
Before the tariff, the domestic price equals the world price. Consumer surplus, the 
area between the demand curve and the world price, is area A 1 B 1 C 1 D 1 E 1 F. 
Producer surplus, the area between the supply curve and the world price, is area G. 
Government revenue equals zero. Total surplus, the sum of consumer surplus, 
producer surplus, and government revenue, is area A 1 B 1 C 1 D 1 E 1 F 1 G.
Once the government imposes a tariff, the domestic price exceeds the world 
price by the amount of the tariff. Consumer surplus is now area A 1 B. Producer 
surplus is area C 1 G. Government revenue, which is the quantity of after-tariff 
imports times the size of the tariff, is the area E. Thus, total surplus with the tariff 
is area A 1 B 1 C 1 E 1 G.

PART Iii	
Markets and Welfare
To determine the total welfare effects of the tariff, we add the change in con-
sumer surplus (which is negative), the change in producer surplus (positive), and 
the change in government revenue (positive). We find that total surplus in the 
market decreases by the area D 1 F. This fall in total surplus is called the dead-
weight loss of the tariff.
A tariff causes a deadweight loss because a tariff is a type of tax. Like most 
taxes, it distorts incentives and pushes the allocation of scarce resources away 
from the optimum. In this case, we can identify two effects. First, when the tariff 
raises the domestic price of textiles above the world price, it encourages domestic 
producers to increase production from Q1
S to Q2
S. Even though the cost of making 
these incremental units exceeds the cost of buying them at the world price, the

A tariff reduces the quantity of imports and moves a market closer to the equilibrium 
that would exist without trade. Total surplus falls by an amount equal to area D 1 F.

tariff makes it profitable for domestic producers to manufacture them nonethe-
less. Second, when the tariff raises the price that domestic textile consumers have 
to pay, it encourages them to reduce consumption of textiles from Q1
D to Q2
D. Even 
though domestic consumers value these incremental units at more than the world 
price, the tariff induces them to cut back their purchases. Area D represents the 
deadweight loss from the overproduction of textiles, and area F represents the 
deadweight loss from the underconsumption of textiles. The total deadweight loss 
of the tariff is the sum of these two triangles.
The Lessons for Trade Policy
The team of Isolandian economists can now write to the new president:
Dear Madame President,
You asked us three questions about opening up trade. After much hard work, 
we have the answers.
Question: If the government allows Isolandians to import and export textiles, 
what will happen to the price of textiles and the quantity of textiles sold in the 
domestic textile market? 
Answer: Once trade is allowed, the Isolandian price of textiles will be driven to 
equal the price prevailing around the world. 
FYI
 Import Quotas: 
Another Way to Restrict Trade
B
eyond tariffs, another way that nations sometimes restrict inter-
national trade is by putting limits on how much of a good can be 
imported. In this book, we will not analyze such a policy, other than to 
point out the conclusion: Import quotas are much like tariffs. Both tariffs 
and import quotas reduce the quantity of imports, raise the domestic 
price of the good, decrease the welfare of domestic consumers, increase 
the welfare of domestic producers, and cause deadweight losses. 
	
There is only one difference between these two types of trade 
restriction: A tariff raises revenue for the government, whereas an 
import quota creates surplus for those who obtain the licenses to 
import. The profit for the holder of an import license is the difference 
between the domestic price (at which he sells the imported good) 
and the world price (at which he buys it).
	
Tariffs and import quotas are even more similar if the govern-
ment charges a fee for the import licenses. Suppose the government 
sets the license fee equal to the difference between the domestic 
price and the world price. In this case, all the profit of license hold-
ers is paid to the government in license fees, and the import quota 
works exactly like a tariff. Consumer surplus, producer surplus, and 
government revenue are precisely the same under the two policies.
	
In practice, however, countries that restrict trade with import ­quotas 
rarely do so by selling the import licenses. For example, the U.S. govern-
ment has at times pressured Japan to “voluntarily” limit the sale of 
Japanese cars in the United States. In this case, the Japanese govern-
ment allocates the import licenses to Japanese firms, and the surplus 
from these licenses accrues to those firms. From the standpoint of U.S. 
welfare, this kind of import quota is worse than a U.S. tariff on imported 
cars. Both a tariff and an import quota raise prices, restrict trade, and 
cause deadweight losses, but at least the tariff produces revenue for the 
U.S. government rather than profit for foreign producers.

Markets and Welfare
If the world price is now higher than the Isolandian price, our price will rise. 
The higher price will reduce the amount of textiles Isolandians consume and 
raise the amount of textiles that Isolandians produce. Isoland will, therefore, 
become a textile exporter. This occurs because, in this case, Isoland has a com-
parative advantage in producing textiles. 
Conversely, if the world price is now lower than the Isolandian price, our 
price will fall. The lower price will raise the amount of textiles that Isolandians 
consume and lower the amount of textiles that Isolandians produce. Isoland 
will, therefore, become a textile importer. This occurs because, in this case, 
other countries have a comparative advantage in producing textiles. 
Question: Who will gain from free trade in textiles and who will lose, and will 
the gains exceed the losses?
Answer: The answer depends on whether the price rises or falls when trade is 
allowed. If the price rises, producers of textiles gain, and consumers of textiles lose. 
If the price falls, consumers gain, and producers lose. In both cases, the gains are 
larger than the losses. Thus, free trade raises the total welfare of Isolandians.
Question: Should a tariff be part of the new trade policy?
Answer: A tariff has an impact only if Isoland becomes a textile importer. In 
this case, a tariff moves the economy closer to the no-trade equilibrium and, 
like most taxes, has deadweight losses. Although a tariff improves the welfare 
of domestic producers and raises revenue for the government, these gains 
are more than offset by the losses suffered by consumers. The best policy, 
from the standpoint of economic efficiency, would be to allow trade without 
a tariff.
We hope you find these answers helpful as you decide on your new policy. 
Your faithful servants,

Other Benefits of International Trade
The conclusions of the Isolandian economics team are based on the standard 
analysis of international trade. Their analysis uses the most fundamental tools in 
the economist’s toolbox: supply, demand, and producer and consumer surplus. 
It shows that there are winners and losers when a nation opens itself up to trade, 
but the gains to the winners exceed the losses of the losers. 
The case for free trade can be made even stronger, however, because there are 
several other economic benefits of trade beyond those emphasized in the standard 
analysis. Here, in a nutshell, are some of these other benefits:
• 	 Increased variety of goods. Goods produced in different countries are not 
exactly the same. German beer, for instance, is not the same as American 
beer. Free trade gives consumers in all countries greater variety from which 
to choose.
• 	 Lower costs through economies of scale. Some goods can be produced at 
low cost only if they are produced in large quantities—a phenomenon called 
economies of scale. A firm in a small country cannot take full advantage of 
economies of scale if it can sell only in a small domestic market. Free trade

 Trade Skirmishes
In recent years, trade between the United States and China has not 
been completely free, as the following two articles illustrate.

U.S. Adds Tariffs on 
Chinese Tires 
By Edmund L. Andrews
W
ashington—In a break with the trade 
policies of his predecessor, President 
Obama announced on Friday night that he 
would impose a 35 percent tariff on automo-
bile and light-truck tires imported from China.
	
The decision is a major victory for 
the United Steelworkers, the union that 
represents American tire workers. And 
Mr. Obama cannot afford to jeopardize his 
relationship with major unions as he pushes 
Congress to overhaul the nation’s health 
care system. 
	
But China is certain to be antagonized 
by the decision….
	
The decision signals the first time that 
the United States has invoked a special 
safeguard provision that was part of its 
agreement to support China’s entry into the 
World Trade Organization in 2001.
	
Under that safeguard provision, American 
companies or workers harmed by imports from 
China can ask the government for protection 
simply by demonstrating that American pro-
ducers have suffered a “market disruption” or 
a “surge” in imports from China. 
	
Unlike more traditional anti-dumping 
cases, the government does not need to deter-
mine that a country is competing unfairly or 
selling its products at less than their true cost.

China Moves to 
Retaliate Against U.S. 
Tire Tariff 
By Keith Bradsher
H
ong Kong—China unexpectedly in­creased 
pressure Sunday on the United States in a 
widening trade dispute, taking the first steps 
toward imposing tariffs on American exports 
of automotive products and chicken meat in 
retaliation for President Obama’s decision late 
Friday to levy tariffs on tires from China. 
	
The Chinese government’s strong coun-
termove followed a weekend of nationalistic 
vitriol against the United States on Chinese 
Web sites in response to the tire tariff. “The 
U.S. is shameless!” said one posting, while 
another called on the Chinese government to 
sell all of its huge holdings of Treasury bonds.
	
The impact of the dispute extends 
well beyond tires, chickens and cars. 
Both governments are facing domestic 
pressure to take a tougher stand against 
the other on economic issues. But the 
trade battle increases political tensions 
between the two nations even as they 
try to work together to revive the global 
economy and combat mutual security 
threats, like the nuclear ambitions of Iran 
and North Korea.

gives firms access to larger world markets and allows them to realize  
economies of scale more fully.
• 	 Increased competition. A company shielded from foreign competitors is more 
likely to have market power, which in turn gives it the ability to raise prices 
above competitive levels. This is a type of market failure. Opening up trade fos-
ters competition and gives the invisible hand a better chance to work its magic.
• 	 Enhanced flow of ideas. The transfer of technological advances around the 
world is often thought to be linked to the trading of the goods that embody 
those advances. The best way for a poor agricultural nation to learn about 
the computer revolution, for instance, is to buy some computers from 
abroad rather than trying to make them domestically. 
Thus, free international trade increases variety for consumers, allows firms 
to take advantage of economies of scale, makes markets more competitive, 
and facilitates the spread of technology. If the Isolandian economists also took 
these effects into account, their advice to their president would be even more 
forceful.

Autarka. When trade is allowed, the price of a suit falls from 3 to 2 ounces of gold. 
In your diagram, show the change in consumer surplus, the change in producer sur-
plus, and the change in total surplus. How would a tariff on suit imports alter these 
effects?
The Arguments for Restricting Trade
The letter from the economics team starts to persuade the new president of Isoland 
to consider allowing trade in textiles. She notes that the domestic price is now high 
compared to the world price. Free trade would, therefore, cause the price of textiles 
to fall and hurt domestic textiles producers. Before implementing the new policy, 
she asks Isolandian textile companies to comment on the economists’ advice.
Not surprisingly, the textile companies oppose free trade in textiles. They 
believe that the government should protect the domestic textile industry from 
foreign competition. Let’s consider some of the arguments they might give to sup-
port their position and how the economics team would respond.
The Jobs Argument
Opponents of free trade often argue that trade with other countries destroys domestic 
jobs. In our example, free trade in textiles would cause the price of textiles to fall, reduc-
ing the quantity of textiles produced in Isoland and thus reducing employment in the 
Isolandian textile industry. Some Isolandian textile workers would lose their jobs.
Yet free trade creates jobs at the same time that it destroys them. When 
Isolandians buy textiles from other countries, those countries obtain the resources 
to buy other goods from Isoland. Isolandian workers would move from the textile 
industry to those industries in which Isoland has a comparative advantage. The 
transition may impose hardship on some workers in the short run, but it allows 
Isolandians as a whole to enjoy a higher standard of living.
Opponents of trade are often skeptical that trade creates jobs. They might 
respond that everything can be produced more cheaply abroad. Under free trade, 
they might argue, Isolandians could not be profitably employed in any industry.

CHAPTER 9    Application: International Trade
 Should the Winners from Free Trade 
Compensate the Losers?
Politicians and pundits often say that the government should help work-
ers made worse off by international trade by, for example, paying for their 
retraining. In this opinion piece, an economist makes the opposite case.
in the news
What to Expect When 
You’re Free Trading 
By Steven E. Landsburg
A
ll economists know that when American 
jobs are outsourced, Americans as a 
group are net winners. What we lose through 
lower wages is more than offset by what we 
gain through lower prices. In other words, the 
winners can more than afford to compensate 
the losers. Does that mean they ought to? 
Does it create a moral mandate for taxpayer-
subsidized retraining programs?…
	
Um, no. Even if you’ve just lost your job, 
there’s something fundamentally churlish 
about blaming the very phenomenon that’s 
elevated you above the subsistence level 
since the day you were born. If the world 
owes you compensation for enduring the 
downside of trade, what do you owe the 
world for enjoying the upside?
	
I doubt there’s a human being on earth 
who hasn’t benefited from the opportunity 
to trade freely with his neighbors. Imagine 
what your life would be like if you had to 
grow your own food, make your own clothes 
and rely on your grandmother’s home reme­
dies for health care. Access to a trained 
physician might reduce the demand for 
grandma’s home remedies, but—especially 
at her age—she’s still got plenty of reason 
to be thankful for having a doctor. 
	
Some people suggest, however, that it 
makes sense to isolate the moral effects of a 
single new trading opportunity or free trade 
agreement. Surely we have fellow citizens 
who are hurt by those agreements, at least 
in the limited sense that they’d be better off 
in a world where trade flourishes, except in 
this one instance. What do we owe those 
fellow citizens?
	
One way to think about that is to ask what 
your moral instincts tell you in analogous situa-
tions. Suppose, after years of buying shampoo 
at your local pharmacy, you discover you 
can order the same shampoo for less money 
on the Web. Do you have an obligation to 
compensate your pharmacist? If you move to 
a cheaper apartment, should you compensate 
your landlord? When you eat at McDonald’s, 
should you compensate the owners of the 
diner next door? Public policy should not be 
designed to advance moral instincts that we 
all reject every day of our lives.
	
In what morally relevant way, then, 
might displaced workers differ from dis-
placed pharmacists or displaced land-
lords? You might argue that pharmacists 
and landlords have always faced cutthroat 
competition and therefore knew what 
they were getting into, while decades of 
tariffs and quotas have led manufacturing 
workers to expect a modicum of protec-
tion. That expectation led them to develop 
certain skills, and now it’s unfair to pull 
the rug out from under them. 
	
Once again, that argument does not 
mesh with our everyday instincts. For many 
decades, schoolyard bullying has been a 
profitable occupation. All across America, 
bullies have built up skills so they can take 
advantage of that opportunity. If we toughen 
the rules to make bullying unprofitable, 
must we compensate the bullies?
	
Bullying and protectionism have a lot 
in common. They both use force (either 
directly or through the power of the law) 
to enrich someone else at your involun-
tary expense. If you’re forced to pay $20 
an hour to an American for goods you 
could have bought from a Mexican for $5 
an hour, you’re being extorted. When a 
free trade agreement allows you to buy 
from the Mexican after all, rejoice in your 
liberation.

As Chapter 3 explains, however, the gains from trade are based on comparative 
advantage, not absolute advantage. Even if one country is better than another 
country at producing everything, each country can still gain from trading with the 
other. Workers in each country will eventually find jobs in an industry in which 
that country has a comparative advantage.

The National-Security Argument
When an industry is threatened with competition from other countries, oppo-
nents of free trade often argue that the industry is vital for national security. For 
example, if Isoland were considering free trade in steel, domestic steel companies 
might point out that steel is used to make guns and tanks. Free trade would allow 
Isoland to become dependent on foreign countries to supply steel. If a war later 
broke out and the foreign supply was interrupted, Isoland might be unable to 
produce enough steel and weapons to defend itself.
Economists acknowledge that protecting key industries may be appropriate when 
there are legitimate concerns over national security. Yet they fear that this argument 
may be used too quickly by producers eager to gain at consumers’ expense. 
One should be wary of the national-security argument when it is made by rep-
resentatives of industry rather than the defense establishment.  Companies have 
an incentive to exaggerate their role in national defense to obtain protection from 
foreign competition. A nation’s generals may see things very differently. Indeed, 
when the military is a consumer of an industry’s output, it would benefit from 
Trouble with Trade 
By Paul Krugman 
W
hile the United States has long import-
ed oil and other raw materials from 
the third world, we used to import manufac-
tured goods mainly from other rich countries 
like Canada, European nations and Japan. 
	
But recently we crossed an important 
watershed: we now import more manu-
factured goods from the third world than 
from other advanced economies. That is, a 
majority of our industrial trade is now with 
countries that are much poorer than we 
are and that pay their workers much lower 
wages.
	
For the world economy as a whole—
and especially for poorer nations—growing 
trade between high-wage and low-wage 
countries is a very good thing. Above all, it 
offers backward economies their best hope 
of moving up the income ladder.
	
But for American workers the story is 
much less positive. In fact, it’s hard to avoid 
the conclusion that growing U.S. trade with 
third-world countries reduces the real wages 
of many and perhaps most workers in this 
country. And that reality makes the politics 
of trade very difficult.
	
Let’s talk for a moment about the 
economics.
	
Trade between high-wage countries 
tends to be a modest win for all, or almost 
all, concerned. When a free-trade pact 
made it possible to integrate the U.S. and 
Canadian auto industries in the 1960s, each 
country’s industry concentrated on produc-
ing a narrower range of products at larger 
scale. The result was an all-round, broadly 
shared rise in productivity and wages.
	
By contrast, trade between countries at 
very different levels of economic develop-
ment tends to create large classes of losers 
as well as winners. 
	
Although the outsourcing of some high-
tech jobs to India has made headlines, on 
balance, highly educated workers in the 
United States benefit from higher wages 
and expanded job opportunities because 
of trade. For example, ThinkPad notebook 
 Second Thoughts about Free Trade
Some economists worry about the impact of trade on the distribution of 
income. Even if free trade enhances efficiency, it may reduce equality.

computers are now made by a Chinese 
company, Lenovo, but a lot of Lenovo’s 
research and development is conducted in 
North Carolina. 
	
But workers with less formal education 
either see their jobs shipped overseas or find 
their wages driven down by the ripple effect 
as other workers with similar qualifications 
crowd into their industries and look for 
employment to replace the jobs they lost 
to foreign competition. And lower prices at 
Wal-Mart aren’t sufficient compensation.
	
All this is textbook international eco-
nomics: contrary to what people sometimes 
assert, economic theory says that free trade 
normally makes a country richer, but it 
doesn’t say that it’s normally good for every-
one. Still, when the effects of third-world 
exports on U.S. wages first became an issue 
in the 1990s, a number of economists—
myself included—looked at the data and 
concluded that any negative effects on U.S. 
wages were modest. 
	
The trouble now is that these effects 
may no longer be as modest as they were, 
because imports of manufactured goods from 
the third world have grown dramatically—
from just 2.5 percent of G.D.P. in 1990 to 
6 percent in 2006. 
	
And the biggest growth in imports has 
come from countries with very low wages. 
The original “newly industrializing econo-
mies” exporting manufactured goods—
South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and 
Singapore—paid wages that were about 25 
percent of U.S. levels in 1990. Since then, 
however, the sources of our imports have 
shifted to Mexico, where wages are only 11 
percent of the U.S. level, and China, where 
they’re only about 3 percent or 4 percent.
	
There are some qualifying aspects to this 
story. For example, many of those made-in-
China goods contain components made in 
Japan and other high-wage economies. Still, 
there’s little doubt that the pressure of glo-
balization on American wages has increased.
	
So am I arguing for protectionism? No. 
Those who think that globalization is always 
and everywhere a bad thing are wrong. On 
the contrary, keeping world markets rela-
tively open is crucial to the hopes of billions 
of people. 
	
But I am arguing for an end to the 
finger-wagging, the accusation either of not 
understanding economics or of kowtowing 
to special interests that tends to be the 
editorial response to politicians who express 
skepticism about the benefits of free-trade 
agreements.
	
It’s often claimed that limits on trade 
benefit only a small number of Americans, 
while hurting the vast majority. That’s still 
true of things like the import quota on sugar. 
But when it comes to manufactured goods, 
it’s at least arguable that the reverse is true. 
The highly educated workers who clearly 
benefit from growing trade with third-world 
economies are a minority, greatly outnum-
bered by those who probably lose.
	
As I said, I’m not a protectionist. For the 
sake of the world as a whole, I hope that 
we respond to the trouble with trade not 
by shutting trade down, but by doing things 
like strengthening the social safety net. But 
those who are worried about trade have a 
point, and deserve some respect.

imports. Cheaper steel in Isoland, for example, would allow the Isolandian mili-
tary to accumulate a stockpile of weapons at lower cost. 
The Infant-Industry Argument
New industries sometimes argue for temporary trade restrictions to help them 
get started. After a period of protection, the argument goes, these industries will 
mature and be able to compete with foreign firms. 
Similarly, older industries sometimes argue that they need temporary protection 
to help them adjust to new conditions. For example, in 2002, President Bush imposed 
temporary tariffs on imported steel. He said, “I decided that imports were severely 
affecting our industry, an important industry.” The tariff, which lasted 20 months, 
offered “temporary relief so that the industry could restructure itself.” 
Economists are often skeptical about such claims, largely because the infant-
industry argument is difficult to implement in practice. To apply protection suc-
cessfully, the government would need to decide which industries will eventually 
be profitable and decide whether the benefits of establishing these industries 
exceed the costs of this protection to consumers. Yet “picking winners” is extraor-
dinarily difficult. It is made even more difficult by the political process, which 
often awards protection to those industries that are politically powerful. And

once a powerful industry is protected from foreign competition, the “temporary” 
policy is sometimes hard to remove.
In addition, many economists are skeptical about the infant-industry argument 
in principle. Suppose, for instance, that an industry is young and unable to compete 
profitably against foreign rivals, but there is reason to believe that the industry can 
be profitable in the long run. In this case, firm owners should be willing to incur tem-
porary losses to obtain the eventual profits. Protection is not necessary for an infant 
industry to grow. History shows that start-up firms often incur temporary losses and 
succeed in the long run, even without protection from competition.
The Unfair-Competition Argument
A common argument is that free trade is desirable only if all countries play by 
the same rules. If firms in different countries are subject to different laws and 
regulations, then it is unfair (the argument goes) to expect the firms to compete 
in the international marketplace. For instance, suppose that the government of 
Neighborland subsidizes its textile industry by giving textile companies large tax 
breaks. The Isolandian textile industry might argue that it should be protected 
from this foreign competition because Neighborland is not competing fairly.
Would it, in fact, hurt Isoland to buy textiles from another country at a subsi-
dized price? Certainly, Isolandian textile producers would suffer, but Isolandian 
textile consumers would benefit from the low price. The case for free trade is no 
different: The gains of the consumers from buying at the low price would exceed 
the losses of the producers. Neighborland’s subsidy to its textile industry may be 
a bad policy, but it is the taxpayers of Neighborland who bear the burden. Isoland 
can benefit from the opportunity to buy textiles at a subsidized price.
The Protection-as-a-Bargaining-Chip Argument
Another argument for trade restrictions concerns the strategy of bargaining. 
Many policymakers claim to support free trade but, at the same time, argue that 
trade restrictions can be useful when we bargain with our trading partners. They 
claim that the threat of a trade restriction can help remove a trade restriction 
already imposed by a foreign government. For example, Isoland might threaten 
to impose a tariff on textiles unless Neighborland removes its tariff on wheat. If 
Neighborland responds to this threat by removing its tariff, the result can be freer 
trade.
The problem with this bargaining strategy is that the threat may not work. If 
it doesn’t work, the country faces a choice between two bad options. It can carry 
out its threat and implement the trade restriction, which would reduce its own 
economic welfare. Or it can back down from its threat, which would cause it to 
lose prestige in international affairs. Faced with this choice, the country would 
probably wish that it had never made the threat in the first place.
Trade Agreements and the World Trade 
Organization
A country can take one of two approaches to achieving free trade. It can take a uni-
lateral approach and remove its trade restrictions on its own. This is the approach 
that Great Britain took in the 19th century and that Chile and South Korea have 
taken in recent years. Alternatively, a country can take a multilateral approach and

CHAPTER 9    Application: International Trade
reduce its trade restrictions while other countries do the same. In other words, it 
can bargain with its trading partners in an attempt to reduce trade restrictions 
around the world. 
	
One important example of the multilateral approach is the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which in 1993 lowered trade barriers among the 
United States, Mexico, and Canada. Another is the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT), which is a continuing series of negotiations among many of 
the world’s countries with the goal of promoting free trade. The United States 
helped to found GATT after World War II in response to the high tariffs imposed 
during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Many economists believe that the high 
tariffs contributed to the worldwide economic hardship of that period. GATT 
has successfully reduced the average tariff among member countries from about 
40 percent after World War II to about 5 percent today. 
	
The rules established under GATT are now enforced by an international insti-
tution called the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO was established in 
1995 and has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. As of 2009, 153 countries 
have joined the organization, accounting for more than 97 percent of world trade. 
The functions of the WTO are to administer trade agreements, provide a forum 
for negotiations, and handle disputes among member countries. 
	
What are the pros and cons of the multilateral approach to free trade? One 
advantage is that the multilateral approach has the potential to result in freer 
trade than a unilateral approach because it can reduce trade restrictions abroad 
as well as at home. If international negotiations fail, however, the result could be 
more restricted trade than under a unilateral approach.
	
In addition, the multilateral approach may have a political advantage. In most 
markets, producers are fewer and better organized than consumers—and thus 
wield greater political influence. Reducing the Isolandian tariff on textiles, for 
example, may be politically difficult if considered by itself. The textile compa-
nies would oppose free trade, and the buyers of textiles who would benefit are 
so numerous that organizing their support would be difficult. Yet suppose that 
Neighborland promises to reduce its tariff on wheat at the same time that Isoland 
reduces its tariff on textiles. In this case, the Isolandian wheat farmers, who 
are also politically powerful, would back the agreement. Thus, the multilateral 
approach to free trade can sometimes win political support when a unilateral 
approach cannot.  ■

Conclusion
Economists and the public often disagree about free trade. In 2008, the Los Angeles 
Times asked the American public, “Generally speaking, do you believe that free 
international trade has helped or hurt the economy, or hasn’t it made a differ-
ence to the economy one way or the other?” Only 26 percent of those polled said 
free international trade helped, whereas 50 percent thought it hurt. (The rest 
thought it made no difference or were unsure.) By contrast, most economists 
support free international trade. They view free trade as a way of allocating 
production efficiently and raising living standards both at home and abroad.

Summary 
Economists view the United States as an ongoing experiment that confirms the 
virtues of free trade. Throughout its history, the United States has allowed unre-
stricted trade among the states, and the country as a whole has benefited from 
the specialization that trade allows. Florida grows oranges, Alaska pumps oil, 
California makes wine, and so on. Americans would not enjoy the high standard 
of living they do today if people could consume only those goods and services 
produced in their own states. The world could similarly benefit from free trade 
among countries.
To better understand economists’ view of trade, let’s continue our parable. 
Suppose that the president of Isoland, after reading the latest poll results, ignores 
the advice of her economics team and decides not to allow free trade in textiles. 
The country remains in the equilibrium without international trade.
Then, one day, some Isolandian inventor discovers a new way to make textiles 
at very low cost. The process is quite mysterious, however, and the inventor 
insists on keeping it a secret. What is odd is that the inventor doesn’t need tradi-
tional inputs such as cotton or wool. The only material input he needs is wheat. 
And even more oddly, to manufacture textiles from wheat, he hardly needs any 
labor input at all.
The inventor is hailed as a genius. Because everyone buys clothing, the lower 
cost of textiles allows all Isolandians to enjoy a higher standard of living. Workers 
who had previously produced textiles experience some hardship when their 
factories close, but eventually, they find work in other industries. Some become 
farmers and grow the wheat that the inventor turns into textiles. Others enter new 
industries that emerge as a result of higher Isolandian living standards. Everyone 
understands that the displacement of workers in outmoded industries is an inevi-
table part of technological progress and economic growth. 
After several years, a newspaper reporter decides to investigate this mysteri-
ous new textiles process. She sneaks into the inventor’s factory and learns that the 
inventor is a fraud. The inventor has not been making textiles at all. Instead, he 
has been smuggling wheat abroad in exchange for textiles from other countries. 
The only thing that the inventor had discovered was the gains from international 
trade.
When the truth is revealed, the government shuts down the inventor’s opera-
tion. The price of textiles rises, and workers return to jobs in textile factories. 
Living standards in Isoland fall back to their former levels. The inventor is jailed 
and held up to public ridicule. After all, he was no inventor. He was just an 
economist.
• The effects of free trade can be determined by 
comparing the domestic price without trade to 
the world price. A low domestic price indicates 
that the country has a comparative advantage 
in producing the good and that the country will 
become an exporter. A high domestic price indi-
cates that the rest of the world has a comparative 
advantage in producing the good and that the 
country will become an importer. 
• When a country allows trade and becomes an 
exporter of a good, producers of the good are 
better off, and consumers of the good are worse 
off. When a country allows trade and becomes an 
importer of a good, consumers are better off, and 
producers are worse off. In both cases, the gains 
from trade exceed the losses.

• A tariff—a tax on imports—moves a market 
closer to the equilibrium that would exist without 
trade and, therefore, reduces the gains from 
trade. Although domestic producers are better 
off and the government raises revenue, the losses 
to consumers exceed these gains.
• There are various arguments for restricting trade: 
protecting jobs, defending national security, 
helping infant industries, preventing unfair 
competition, and responding to foreign trade 
restrictions. Although some of these arguments 
have some merit in some cases, economists 
believe that free trade is usually the better policy.

Questions for Review
	 1.	 What does the domestic price that prevails 
without international trade tell us about a 
nation’s comparative advantage?
	 2.	 When does a country become an exporter of a 
good? An importer?
	 3.	 Draw the supply-and-demand diagram for an 
importing country. What is consumer surplus 
and producer surplus before trade is allowed? 
What is consumer surplus and producer 
surplus with free trade? What is the change in 
total surplus?
	 4.	 Describe what a tariff is and its economic effects.
	 5.	 List five arguments often given to support trade 
restrictions. How do economists respond to 
these arguments?

Problems and Applications
	 1.	 Mexico represents a small part of the world 
orange market.
a.	 Draw a diagram depicting the equilibrium 
in the Mexican orange market without 
international trade. Identify the equilibrium 
price, equilibrium quantity, consumer 
surplus, and producer surplus.
b.	Suppose that the world orange price is below 
the Mexican price before trade and that the 
Mexican orange market is now opened to 
trade. Identify the new equilibrium price, 
quantity consumed, quantity produced 
domestically, and quantity imported. Also 
show the change in the surplus of domestic 
consumers and producers. Has total surplus 
increased or decreased?
	 2.	 The world price of wine is below the price that 
would prevail in Canada in the absence of trade.
a.	 Assuming that Canadian imports of wine are 
a small part of total world wine production, 
draw a graph for the Canadian market for 
wine under free trade. Identify consumer 
surplus, producer surplus, and total surplus 
in an appropriate table.
b.	Now suppose that an unusual shift of the 
Gulf Stream leads to an unseasonably cold 
summer in Europe, destroying much of the 
grape harvest there. What effect does this 
shock have on the world price of wine? Using 
your graph and table from part (a), show 
the effect on consumer surplus, producer 
surplus, and total surplus in Canada. Who 
are the winners and losers? Is Canada as a 
whole better or worse off?
	 3.	 Suppose that Congress imposes a tariff on 
imported autos to protect the U.S. auto industry

from foreign competition. Assuming that the 
United States is a price taker in the world auto 
market, show the following on a diagram: the 
change in the quantity of imports, the loss to 
U.S. consumers, the gain to U.S. manufacturers, 
government revenue, and the deadweight 
loss associated with the tariff. The loss to 
consumers can be decomposed into three pieces: 
a gain to domestic producers, revenue for the 
government, and a deadweight loss. Use your 
diagram to identify these three pieces.
	 4.	 When China’s clothing industry expands, the 
increase in world supply lowers the world price 
of clothing. 
a.	 Draw an appropriate diagram to analyze 
how this change in price affects consumer 
surplus, producer surplus, and total surplus 
in a nation that imports clothing, such as the 
United States. 
b.	Now draw an appropriate diagram to show 
how this change in price affects consumer 
surplus, producer surplus, and total surplus 
in a nation that exports clothing, such as the 
Dominican Republic. 
c.	 Compare your answers to parts (a) and 
(b). What are the similarities and what are 
the differences? Which country should 
be concerned about the expansion of the 
Chinese textile industry? Which country 
should be applauding it? Explain.
	 5.	 Imagine that winemakers in the state of 
Washington petitioned the state government to 
tax wines imported from California. They argue 
that this tax would both raise tax revenue for 
the state government and raise employment in 
the Washington state wine industry. Do you 
agree with these claims? Is it a good policy?
	 6.	 Consider the arguments for restricting trade.
a.	 Assume you are a lobbyist for timber, an 
established industry suffering from low-
priced foreign competition. Which two or 
three of the five arguments do you think 
would be most persuasive to the average 
member of Congress as to why he or she 
should support trade restrictions? Explain 
your reasoning.
b.	Now assume you are an astute student 
of economics (hopefully not a hard 
assumption). Although all the arguments for 
restricting trade have their shortcomings, 
name the two or three arguments that seem 
to make the most economic sense to you. 
For each, describe the economic rationale 
for and against these arguments for trade 
restrictions.
	 7.	 Senator Ernest Hollings once wrote that 
“consumers do not benefit from lower-priced 
imports. Glance through some mail-order 
catalogs and you’ll see that consumers pay 
exactly the same price for clothing whether it is 
U.S.-made or imported.” Comment.
	 8.	 The nation of Textilia does not allow imports 
of clothing. In its equilibrium without trade, a 
T-shirt costs $20, and the equilibrium quantity is 
3 million T-shirts. One day, after reading Adam 
Smith’s The Wealth of Nations while on vacation, 
the president decides to open the Textilian 
market to international trade. The market 
price of a T-shirt falls to the world price of $16. 
The number of T-shirts consumed in Textilia 
rises to 4 million, while the number of T-shirts 
produced declines to 1 million. 
a.	 Illustrate the situation just described in 
a graph. Your graph should show all the 
numbers.
b.	Calculate the change in consumer surplus, 
producer surplus, and total surplus that 
results from opening up trade. (Hint: Recall 
that the area of a triangle is ½ × base × 
height.)
	 9.	 China is a major producer of grains, such as 
wheat, corn, and rice. In 2008 the Chinese 
government, concerned that grain exports were 
driving up food prices for domestic consumers, 
imposed a tax on grain exports.
a.	 Draw the graph that describes the market for 
grain in an exporting country. Use this graph 
as the starting point to answer the following 
questions.
b.	How does an export tax affect domestic grain 
prices? 
c.	 How does it affect the welfare of domestic 
consumers, the welfare of domestic 
producers, and government revenue?
d.	What happens to total welfare in China, as 
measured by the sum of consumer surplus, 
producer surplus, and tax revenue?
	10.	 Consider a country that imports a good from 
abroad. For each of following statements, say 
whether it is true or false. Explain your answer.
a.	 “The greater the elasticity of demand, the 
greater the gains from trade.”

CHAPTER 9    Application: International Trade
b.	“If demand is perfectly inelastic, there are no 
gains from trade.”
c.	 “If demand is perfectly inelastic, consumers 
do not benefit from trade.” 
	11.	 Kawmin is a small country that produces and 
consumes jelly beans. The world price of jelly 
beans is $1 per bag, and Kawmin’s domestic 
demand and supply for jelly beans are governed 
by the following equations:
Demand: QD 5 8 – P
Supply:    QS  5 P,
where P is in dollars per bag and Q is in bags of 
jelly beans.
a.	 Draw a well-labeled graph of the situation in 
Kawmin if the nation does not allow trade. 
Calculate the following (recalling that the 
area of a triangle is ½ 3 base 3 height): the 
equilibrium price and quantity, consumer 
surplus, producer surplus, and total surplus.
b.	Kawmin then opens the market to trade. 
Draw another graph to describe the 
new situation in the jelly bean market. 
Calculate the equilibrium price, quantities 
of consumption and production, imports, 
consumer surplus, producer surplus, and 
total surplus.
c.	 After a while, the Czar of Kawmin responds 
to the pleas of jelly bean producers by 
placing a $1 per bag tariff on jelly bean 
imports. On a graph, show the effects of 
this tariff. Calculate the equilibrium price, 
quantities of consumption and production, 
imports, consumer surplus, producer surplus, 
government revenue, and total surplus.
d.	What are the gains from opening up 
trade? What are the deadweight losses 
from restricting trade with the tariff? Give 
numerical answers.
	12.	 Having rejected a tariff on textiles (a tax on 
imports), the president of Isoland is now 
considering the same-sized tax on textile 
consumption (including both imported and 
domestically produced textiles).
a.	 Using Figure 4, identify the quantity 
consumed and the quantity produced in 
Isoland under a textile consumption tax. 
b.	Construct a table similar to that in Figure 4 
for the textile consumption tax.
c.	 Which raises more revenue for the 
government—the consumption tax or the 
tariff? Which has a smaller deadweight loss?  
Explain.
	13.	 Assume the United States is an importer of 
televisions and there are no trade restrictions. 
U.S. consumers buy 1 million televisions 
per year, of which 400,000 are produced 
domestically and 600,000 are imported. 
a.	 Suppose that a technological advance among 
Japanese television manufacturers causes 
the world price of televisions to fall by $100. 
Draw a graph to show how this change 
affects the welfare of U.S. consumers and U.S. 
producers and how it affects total surplus in 
the United States.
b.	After the fall in price, consumers buy 1.2 
million televisions, of which 200,000 are 
produced domestically and 1 million are 
imported. Calculate the change in consumer 
surplus, producer surplus, and total surplus 
from the price reduction.
c.	 If the government responded by putting a 
$100 tariff on imported televisions, what 
would this do? Calculate the revenue 
that would be raised and the deadweight 
loss. Would it be a good policy from the 
standpoint of U.S. welfare? Who might 
support the policy? 
d.	Suppose that the fall in price is attributable 
not to technological advance but to a $100 
per television subsidy from the Japanese 
government to Japanese industry. How 
would this affect your analysis? 
	14.	 Consider a small country that exports steel. 
Suppose that a “pro-trade” government 
decides to subsidize the export of steel by 
paying a certain amount for each ton sold 
abroad. How does this export subsidy affect 
the domestic price of steel, the quantity 
of steel produced, the quantity of steel 
consumed, and the quantity of steel exported? 
How does it affect consumer surplus, 
producer surplus, government revenue, and 
total surplus? Is it a good policy from the 
standpoint of economic efficiency? (Hint: The 
analysis of an export subsidy is similar to the 
analysis of a tariff.)
