hen consumers go to grocery stores to buy their turkeys for 
Thanksgiving dinner, they may be disappointed that the price of 
turkey is as high as it is. At the same time, when farmers bring to 
market the turkeys they have raised, they wish the price of turkey 
were even higher. These views are not surprising: Buyers always want to pay less, 
and sellers always want to be paid more. But is there a “right price” for turkey 
from the standpoint of society as a whole?
In previous chapters, we saw how, in market economies, the forces of supply 
and demand determine the prices of goods and services and the quantities sold. 
So far, however, we have described the way markets allocate scarce resources 
without directly addressing the question of whether these market allocations are

desirable. In other words, our analysis has been positive (what is) rather than nor-
mative (what should be). We know that the price of turkey adjusts to ensure that 
the quantity of turkey supplied equals the quantity of turkey demanded. But at 
this equilibrium, is the quantity of turkey produced and consumed too small, too 
large, or just right?
In this chapter, we take up the topic of welfare economics, the study of how 
the allocation of resources affects economic well-being. We begin by examining 
the benefits that buyers and sellers receive from taking part in a market. We then 
examine how society can make these benefits as large as possible. This analysis 
leads to a profound conclusion: The equilibrium of supply and demand in a mar-
ket maximizes the total benefits received by buyers and sellers.
As you may recall from Chapter 1, one of the Ten Principles of Economics is 
that markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity. The study of 
welfare economics explains this principle more fully. It also answers our question 
about the right price of turkey: The price that balances the supply and demand for 
turkey is, in a particular sense, the best one because it maximizes the total welfare 
of turkey consumers and turkey producers. No consumer or producer of turkeys 
aims to achieve this goal, but their joint action directed by market prices moves 
them toward a welfare-maximizing outcome, as if led by an invisible hand.
Consumer Surplus
We begin our study of welfare economics by looking at the benefits buyers receive 
from participating in a market. 
Willingness to Pay  
Imagine that you own a mint-condition recording of Elvis Presley’s first album. 
Because you are not an Elvis Presley fan, you decide to sell it. One way to do so 
is to hold an auction.
Four Elvis fans show up for your auction: John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Each 
of them would like to own the album, but there is a limit to the amount that each 
is willing to pay for it. Table 1 shows the maximum price that each of the four pos-
sible buyers would pay. Each buyer’s maximum is called his willingness to pay, 
and it measures how much that buyer values the good. Each buyer would be eager 
to buy the album at a price less than his willingness to pay, and he would refuse to 
buy the album at a price greater than his willingness to pay. At a price equal to his 
willingness to pay, the buyer would be indifferent about buying the good: If the 
price is exactly the same as the value he places on the album, he would be equally 
happy buying it or keeping his money.

CHAPTER 7    Consumers, Producers, and the Efficiency of Markets
To sell your album, you begin the bidding at a low price, say, $10. Because all 
four buyers are willing to pay much more, the price rises quickly. The bidding 
stops when John bids $80 (or slightly more). At this point, Paul, George, and 
Ringo have dropped out of the bidding because they are unwilling to bid any 
more than $80. John pays you $80 and gets the album. Note that the album has 
gone to the buyer who values it most highly.
What benefit does John receive from buying the Elvis Presley album? In a 
sense, John has found a real bargain: He is willing to pay $100 for the album but 
pays only $80 for it. We say that John receives consumer surplus of $20. Consumer 
surplus is the amount a buyer is willing to pay for a good minus the amount the 
buyer actually pays for it.
Consumer surplus measures the benefit buyers receive from participating in 
a market. In this example, John receives a $20 benefit from participating in the 
auction because he pays only $80 for a good he values at $100. Paul, George, and 
Ringo get no consumer surplus from participating in the auction because they left 
without the album and without paying anything.
Now consider a somewhat different example. Suppose that you had two identi-
cal Elvis Presley albums to sell. Again, you auction them off to the four possible 
buyers. To keep things simple, we assume that both albums are to be sold for 
the same price and that no buyer is interested in buying more than one album. 
Therefore, the price rises until two buyers are left.
In this case, the bidding stops when John and Paul bid $70 (or slightly higher). 
At this price, John and Paul are each happy to buy an album, and George and 
Ringo are not willing to bid any higher. John and Paul each receive consumer sur-
plus equal to his willingness to pay minus the price. John’s consumer surplus is 
$30, and Paul’s is $10. John’s consumer surplus is higher now than in the previous 
example because he gets the same album but pays less for it. The total consumer 
surplus in the market is $40.
Using the Demand Curve to Measure  
Consumer Surplus
Consumer surplus is closely related to the demand curve for a product. To see 
how they are related, let’s continue our example and consider the demand curve 
for this rare Elvis Presley album. 
We begin by using the willingness to pay of the four possible buyers to find the 
demand schedule for the album. The table in Figure 1 shows the demand sched-
ule that corresponds to Table 1. If the price is above $100, the quantity demanded 
in the market is 0 because no buyer is willing to pay that much. If the price is 
between $80 and $100, the quantity demanded is 1 because only John is willing to 
pay such a high price. If the price is between $70 and $80, the quantity demanded 
is 2 because both John and Paul are willing to pay the price. We can continue this 
analysis for other prices as well. In this way, the demand schedule is derived from 
the willingness to pay of the four possible buyers.
The graph in Figure 1 shows the demand curve that corresponds to this demand 
schedule. Note the relationship between the height of the demand curve and the 
buyers’ willingness to pay. At any quantity, the price given by the demand curve 
shows the willingness to pay of the marginal buyer, the buyer who would leave the 
market first if the price were any higher. At a quantity of 4 albums, for instance, the 
demand curve has a height of $50, the price that Ringo (the marginal buyer) is will-
ing to pay for an album. At a quantity of 3 albums, the demand curve has a height 
of $70, the price that George (who is now the marginal buyer) is willing to pay.

Because the demand curve reflects buyers’ willingness to pay, we can also 
use it to measure consumer surplus. Figure 2 uses the demand curve to compute 
consumer surplus in our two examples. In panel (a), the price is $80 (or slightly 
above), and the quantity demanded is 1. Note that the area above the price and 
below the demand curve equals $20. This amount is exactly the consumer surplus 
we computed earlier when only 1 album is sold.
Panel (b) of Figure 2 shows consumer surplus when the price is $70 (or slightly 
above). In this case, the area above the price and below the demand curve equals 
the total area of the two rectangles: John’s consumer surplus at this price is $30 
and Paul’s is $10. This area equals a total of $40. Once again, this amount is the 
consumer surplus we computed earlier. 
The lesson from this example holds for all demand curves: The area below the 
demand curve and above the price measures the consumer surplus in a market. This is 
true because the height of the demand curve measures the value buyers place on 
the good, as measured by their willingness to pay for it. The difference between 
this willingness to pay and the market price is each buyer’s consumer surplus. 
Thus, the total area below the demand curve and above the price is the sum of the 
consumer surplus of all buyers in the market for a good or service.
How a Lower Price Raises Consumer Surplus  
Because buyers always want to pay less for the goods they buy, a lower price 
makes buyers of a good better off. But how much does buyers’ well-being rise in

CHAPTER 7    Consumers, Producers, and the Efficiency of Markets
response to a lower price? We can use the concept of consumer surplus to answer 
this question precisely.
Figure 3 shows a typical demand curve. You may notice that this curve gradu-
ally slopes downward instead of taking discrete steps as in the previous two fig-
ures. In a market with many buyers, the resulting steps from each buyer dropping 
out are so small that they form, in essence, a smooth curve. Although this curve 
has a different shape, the ideas we have just developed still apply: Consumer 
surplus is the area above the price and below the demand curve. In panel (a), 
consumer surplus at a price of P1 is the area of triangle ABC.
Now suppose that the price falls from P1 to P2, as shown in panel (b). The con-
sumer surplus now equals area ADF. The increase in consumer surplus attribut-
able to the lower price is the area BCFD.
This increase in consumer surplus is composed of two parts. First, those buy-
ers who were already buying Q1 of the good at the higher price P1 are better off 
because they now pay less. The increase in consumer surplus of existing buyers 
is the reduction in the amount they pay; it equals the area of the rectangle BCED. 
Second, some new buyers enter the market because they are willing to buy the 
good at the lower price. As a result, the quantity demanded in the market increases 
from Q1 to Q2. The consumer surplus these newcomers receive is the area of the 
triangle CEF.

What Does Consumer Surplus Measure?
Our goal in developing the concept of consumer surplus is to make judgments 
about the desirability of market outcomes. Now that you have seen what consumer 
surplus is, let’s consider whether it is a good measure of economic well-being. 
Imagine that you are a policymaker trying to design a good economic system. 
Would you care about the amount of consumer surplus? Consumer surplus, the 
amount that buyers are willing to pay for a good minus the amount they actu-
ally pay for it, measures the benefit that buyers receive from a good as the buyers 
themselves perceive it. Thus, consumer surplus is a good measure of economic well-
being if policymakers want to respect the preferences of buyers.
In some circumstances, policymakers might choose not to care about consumer 
surplus because they do not respect the preferences that drive buyer behavior. For 
example, drug addicts are willing to pay a high price for heroin. Yet we would not 
say that addicts get a large benefit from being able to buy heroin at a low price 
(even though addicts might say they do). From the standpoint of society, will-
ingness to pay in this instance is not a good measure of the buyers’ benefit, and 
consumer surplus is not a good measure of economic well-being, because addicts 
are not looking after their own best interests.
In most markets, however, consumer surplus does reflect economic well-being. 
Economists normally assume that buyers are rational when they make decisions. 
Rational people do the best they can to achieve their objectives, given their oppor-
tunities. Economists also normally assume that people’s preferences should be 
In panel (a), the price is P1, the quantity demanded is Q1, and consumer surplus equals 
the area of the triangle ABC. When the price falls from P1 to P2, as in panel (b), the 
quantity demanded rises from Q1 to Q2, and the consumer surplus rises to the area of 
the triangle ADF. The increase in consumer surplus (area BCFD) occurs in part because 
existing consumers now pay less (area BCED) and in part because new consumers enter 
the market at the lower price (area CEF).

receive from the goods they buy.

Producer Surplus
We now turn to the other side of the market and consider the benefits sellers 
receive from participating in a market. As you will see, our analysis of sellers’ 
welfare is similar to our analysis of buyers’ welfare.
Cost and the Willingness to Sell
Imagine now that you are a homeowner and you want to get your house painted. 
You turn to four sellers of painting services: Mary, Frida, Georgia, and Grandma. 
Each painter is willing to do the work for you if the price is right. You decide to 
take bids from the four painters and auction off the job to the painter who will do 
the work for the lowest price.
Each painter is willing to take the job if the price she would receive exceeds 
her cost of doing the work. Here the term cost should be interpreted as the paint-
ers’ opportunity cost: It includes the painters’ out-of-pocket expenses (for paint, 
brushes, and so on) as well as the value that the painters place on their own time. 
Table 2 shows each painter’s cost. Because a painter’s cost is the lowest price she 
would accept for her work, cost is a measure of her willingness to sell her services. 
Each painter would be eager to sell her services at a price greater than her cost, and 
she would refuse to sell her services at a price less than her cost. At a price exactly 
equal to her cost, she would be indifferent about selling her services: She would be 
equally happy getting the job or using her time and energy for another purpose.
When you take bids from the painters, the price might start high, but it quickly 
falls as the painters compete for the job. Once Grandma has bid $600 (or slightly 
less), she is the sole remaining bidder. Grandma is happy to do the job for this 
price because her cost is only $500. Mary, Frida, and Georgia are unwilling to do 
the job for less than $600. Note that the job goes to the painter who can do the 
work at the lowest cost.
What benefit does Grandma receive from getting the job? Because she is willing 
to do the work for $500 but gets $600 for doing it, we say that she receives producer 
surplus of $100. Producer surplus is the amount a seller is paid minus the cost of 
production. Producer surplus measures the benefit sellers receive from participat-
ing in a market.

Markets and Welfare
Now consider a somewhat different example. Suppose that you have two 
houses that need painting. Again, you auction off the jobs to the four painters. To 
keep things simple, let’s assume that no painter is able to paint both houses and 
that you will pay the same amount to paint each house. Therefore, the price falls 
until two painters are left.
In this case, the bidding stops when Georgia and Grandma each offer to do the 
job for a price of $800 (or slightly less). Georgia and Grandma are willing to do 
the work at this price, while Mary and Frida are not willing to bid a lower price. At 
a price of $800, Grandma receives producer surplus of $300, and Georgia receives 
producer surplus of $200. The total producer surplus in the market is $500.
Using the Supply Curve to Measure  
Producer Surplus
Just as consumer surplus is closely related to the demand curve, producer surplus 
is closely related to the supply curve. To see how, let’s continue our example. 
We begin by using the costs of the four painters to find the supply schedule 
for painting services. The table in Figure 4 shows the supply schedule that corre-
sponds to the costs in Table 2. If the price is below $500, none of the four painters 
is willing to do the job, so the quantity supplied is zero. If the price is between 
$500 and $600, only Grandma is willing to do the job, so the quantity supplied is 1. 
If the price is between $600 and $800, Grandma and Georgia are willing to do the 
job, so the quantity supplied is 2, and so on. Thus, the supply schedule is derived 
from the costs of the four painters.
The graph in Figure 4 shows the supply curve that corresponds to this supply 
schedule. Note that the height of the supply curve is related to the sellers’ costs.

CHAPTER 7    Consumers, Producers, and the Efficiency of Markets
At any quantity, the price given by the supply curve shows the cost of the marginal 
seller, the seller who would leave the market first if the price were any lower. At a 
quantity of 4 houses, for instance, the supply curve has a height of $900, the cost 
that Mary (the marginal seller) incurs to provide her painting services. At a quan-
tity of 3 houses, the supply curve has a height of $800, the cost that Frida (who is 
now the marginal seller) incurs.
Because the supply curve reflects sellers’ costs, we can use it to measure pro-
ducer surplus. Figure 5 uses the supply curve to compute producer surplus in 
our two examples. In panel (a), we assume that the price is $600. In this case, the 
quantity supplied is 1. Note that the area below the price and above the supply 
curve equals $100. This amount is exactly the producer surplus we computed 
earlier for Grandma.
Panel (b) of Figure 5 shows producer surplus at a price of $800. In this case, the 
area below the price and above the supply curve equals the total area of the two 
rectangles. This area equals $500, the producer surplus we computed earlier for 
Georgia and Grandma when two houses needed painting.
The lesson from this example applies to all supply curves: The area below the 
price and above the supply curve measures the producer surplus in a market. The logic 
is straightforward: The height of the supply curve measures sellers’ costs, and the 
difference between the price and the cost of production is each seller’s producer 
surplus. Thus, the total area is the sum of the producer surplus of all sellers.

How a Higher Price Raises Producer Surplus
You will not be surprised to hear that sellers always want to receive a higher price for 
the goods they sell. But how much does sellers’ well-being rise in response to a higher 
price? The concept of producer surplus offers a precise answer to this question.
Figure 6 shows a typical upward-sloping supply curve that would arise in a 
market with many sellers. Although this supply curve differs in shape from the 
previous figure, we measure producer surplus in the same way: Producer surplus 
is the area below the price and above the supply curve. In panel (a), the price is P1, 
and producer surplus is the area of triangle ABC.
Panel (b) shows what happens when the price rises from P1 to P2. Producer sur-
plus now equals area ADF. This increase in producer surplus has two parts. First, 
those sellers who were already selling Q1 of the good at the lower price P1 are 
better off because they now get more for what they sell. The increase in producer 
surplus for existing sellers equals the area of the rectangle BCED. Second, some 
new sellers enter the market because they are willing to produce the good at the 
higher price, resulting in an increase in the quantity supplied from Q1 to Q2. The 
producer surplus of these newcomers is the area of the triangle CEF.
As this analysis shows, we use producer surplus to measure the well-being of 
sellers in much the same way as we use consumer surplus to measure the well-
being of buyers. Because these two measures of economic welfare are so similar, 
it is natural to use them together. And indeed, that is exactly what we do in the 
next section.

How the Price Affects 
Producer Surplus
In panel (a), the price is P1, the quantity demanded is Q1, and producer surplus equals 
the area of the triangle ABC. When the price rises from P1 to P2, as in panel (b), the 
quantity supplied rises from Q1 to Q2, and the producer surplus rises to the area of 
the triangle ADF. The increase in producer surplus (area BCFD) occurs in part because 
existing producers now receive more (area BCED) and in part because new producers 
enter the market at the higher price (area CEF).

Market Efficiency
Consumer surplus and producer surplus are the basic tools that economists use 
to study the welfare of buyers and sellers in a market. These tools can help us 
address a fundamental economic question: Is the allocation of resources deter-
mined by free markets desirable?
The Benevolent Social Planner
To evaluate market outcomes, we introduce into our analysis a new, hypotheti-
cal character called the benevolent social planner. The benevolent social planner 
is an all-knowing, all-powerful, well-intentioned dictator. The planner wants to 
maximize the economic well-being of everyone in society. What should this plan-
ner do? Should he just leave buyers and sellers at the equilibrium that they reach 
naturally on their own? Or can he increase economic well-being by altering the 
market outcome in some way?
To answer this question, the planner must first decide how to measure the 
economic well-being of a society. One possible measure is the sum of consumer 
and producer surplus, which we call total surplus. Consumer surplus is the benefit 
that buyers receive from participating in a market, and producer surplus is the 
benefit that sellers receive. It is therefore natural to use total surplus as a measure 
of society’s economic well-being.
To better understand this measure of economic well-being, recall how we mea-
sure consumer and producer surplus. We define consumer surplus as
Consumer surplus 5 Value to buyers 2 Amount paid by buyers.
Similarly, we define producer surplus as
Producer surplus 5 Amount received by sellers 2 Cost to sellers.
When we add consumer and producer surplus together, we obtain
Total surplus 5 (Value to buyers 2 Amount paid by buyers) 
	
1 (Amount received by sellers 2 Cost to sellers).
The amount paid by buyers equals the amount received by sellers, so the middle 
two terms in this expression cancel each other. As a result, we can write total 
surplus as
Total surplus 5 Value to buyers 2 Cost to sellers. 
Total surplus in a market is the total value to buyers of the goods, as measured by 
their willingness to pay, minus the total cost to sellers of providing those goods.
If an allocation of resources maximizes total surplus, we say that the alloca-
tion exhibits efficiency. If an allocation is not efficient, then some of the potential 
gains from trade among buyers and sellers are not being realized. For example, 
efficiency
the property of a resource 
allocation of maximizing 
the total surplus received 
by all members of society

Markets and Welfare
an allocation is inefficient if a good is not being produced by the sellers with low-
est cost. In this case, moving production from a high-cost producer to a low-cost 
producer will lower the total cost to sellers and raise total surplus. Similarly, an 
allocation is inefficient if a good is not being consumed by the buyers who value 
it most highly. In this case, moving consumption of the good from a buyer with a 
low valuation to a buyer with a high valuation will raise total surplus. 
In addition to efficiency, the social planner might also care about equality—
that is, whether the various buyers and sellers in the market have a similar level 
of economic well-being. In essence, the gains from trade in a market are like a pie 
to be shared among the market participants. The question of efficiency concerns 
whether the pie is as big as possible. The question of equality concerns how the 
pie is sliced and how the portions are distributed among members of society. In 
this chapter, we concentrate on efficiency as the social planner’s goal. Keep in 
mind, however, that real policymakers often care about equality as well. 
Evaluating the Market Equilibrium 
Figure 7 shows consumer and producer surplus when a market reaches the 
equilibrium of supply and demand. Recall that consumer surplus equals the area 
above the price and under the demand curve and producer surplus equals the 
area below the price and above the supply curve. Thus, the total area between 
the supply and demand curves up to the point of equilibrium represents the total 
surplus in this market. 
Is this equilibrium allocation of resources efficient? That is, does it maximize 
total surplus? To answer this question, recall that when a market is in equilibrium, 
the price determines which buyers and sellers participate in the market. Those 
buyers who value the good more than the price (represented by the segment

AE on the demand curve) choose to buy the good; buyers who value it less than 
the price (represented by the segment EB) do not. Similarly, those sellers whose 
costs are less than the price (represented by the segment CE on the supply curve) 
choose to produce and sell the good; sellers whose costs are greater than the price 
(represented by the segment ED) do not.
These observations lead to two insights about market outcomes:
	 1.	 Free markets allocate the supply of goods to the buyers who value them 
most highly, as measured by their willingness to pay.
	 2.	 Free markets allocate the demand for goods to the sellers who can produce 
them at the lowest cost.
Thus, given the quantity produced and sold in a market equilibrium, the social 
planner cannot increase economic well-being by changing the allocation of con-
sumption among buyers or the allocation of production among sellers.
But can the social planner raise total economic well-being by increasing or 
decreasing the quantity of the good? The answer is no, as stated in this third 
insight about market outcomes: 
	 3.	 Free markets produce the quantity of goods that maximizes the sum of  
consumer and producer surplus.
Figure 8 illustrates why this is true. To interpret this figure, keep in mind that the 
demand curve reflects the value to buyers and the supply curve reflects the cost 
to sellers. At any quantity below the equilibrium level, such as Q1, the value to the 
marginal buyer exceeds the cost to the marginal seller. As a result, increasing the 
The Efficiency of the Equilibrium Quantity
At quantities less than the equilibrium quantity, such 
as Q1, the value to buyers exceeds the cost to sellers. 
At quantities greater than the equilibrium quantity, 
such as Q2, the cost to sellers exceeds the value to 
buyers. Therefore, the market equilibrium maximizes 
the sum of producer and consumer surplus.

quantity produced and consumed raises total surplus. This continues to be true 
until the quantity reaches the equilibrium level. Similarly, at any quantity beyond 
the equilibrium level, such as Q2, the value to the marginal buyer is less than the 
cost to the marginal seller. In this case, decreasing the quantity raises total sur-
plus, and this continues to be true until quantity falls to the equilibrium level. To 
maximize total surplus, the social planner would choose the quantity where the 
supply and demand curves intersect.
Together, these three insights tell us that the market outcome makes the sum of 
consumer and producer surplus as large as it can be. In other words, the equilib-
rium outcome is an efficient allocation of resources. The benevolent social planner 
can, therefore, leave the market outcome just as he finds it. This policy of leaving 
well enough alone goes by the French expression laissez faire, which literally trans-
lates to “allow them to do.” 
Society is lucky that the planner doesn’t need to intervene. Although it has been 
a useful exercise imagining what an all-knowing, all-powerful, well-intentioned 
dictator would do, let’s face it: Such characters are hard to come by. Dictators 
are rarely benevolent, and even if we found someone so virtuous, he would lack 
crucial information.
Suppose our social planner tried to choose an efficient allocation of resources 
on his own, instead of relying on market forces. To do so, he would need to know

Scalping Is a Force in 
the Free Market
By Charles Stein
C
hip Case devotes a class each year to 
the reselling of sports tickets. He has 
a section in his economics textbook on the 
same subject.
	
But for Case, an economics professor 
at Wellesley College, the sale and scalping 
of sports tickets is more than an interesting 
theoretical pursuit. Like Margaret Mead, he 
has done plenty of firsthand research in the 
jungle, and he has the stories to prove it.
	
In 1984, Case waited in line for two 
nights on Causeway Street to get $11 
tickets to one of the classic Celtics-Lakers 
championship series. The night before the 
climactic seventh game, he was in the 
shower when his daughter called out to 
him: “Dad, there’s a guy on the phone who 
wants to buy your Celtics tickets.” Case said 
he wasn’t selling. “But Dad,” his daughter 
added, “he’s willing to pay at least $1,000 
apiece for them.”
	
Case was selling. An hour later, a limo 
arrived at the house to pick up two tickets—
one that belonged to Case and one to a friend 
of his. The driver left behind $3,000.
	
To Case and other economists, tickets 
are a textbook case of the free market in 
action. When supply is limited and demand 
is not, prices rise and the people willing to 
pay more will eventually get their hands on 
the tickets. “As long as people can com-
municate, there will be trades,” said Case.
	
In the age of the Internet, buyers and 
sellers can link up online, through eBay or 
the sites devoted solely to ticket sales. But 
even in the pre-Internet era, the process 
worked, albeit more slowly. In 1984, the 
man who bought Case’s tickets was a rich

the value of a particular good to every potential consumer in the market and the 
cost of every potential producer. And he would need this information not only for 
this market but for every one of the many thousands of markets in the economy. 
The task is practically impossible, which explains why centrally planned econo-
mies never work very well.
The planner’s job becomes easy, however, once he takes on a partner: Adam 
Smith’s invisible hand of the marketplace. The invisible hand takes all the infor-
mation about buyers and sellers into account and guides everyone in the market 
to the best outcome as judged by the standard of economic efficiency. It is, truly, 
a remarkable feat. That is why economists so often advocate free markets as the 
best way to organize economic activity.
Should There Be a Market in Organs?
Some years ago, the front page of the Boston Globe ran the headline “How a 
Mother’s Love Helped Save Two Lives.” The newspaper told the story of Susan 
Stephens, a woman whose son needed a kidney transplant. When the doctor 
New Yorker whose son attended a Boston 
private school. The man called a friend at 
the school, who called someone else, who 
eventually called Case. Where there is a will, 
there is a way.
	
Trading happens no matter how hard 
teams try to suppress it. The National 
Football League gives some of its Super 
Bowl tickets to its teams, and prohibits them 
from reselling. Yet many of those same tick-
ets wind up back on the secondary market. 
Last season the league caught Minnesota 
Vikings head coach Mike Tice selling his 
tickets to a California ticket agency. “I regret 
it,” Tice told Sports Illustrated afterward. Or 
at least he regretted getting caught.
	
Like any good market, the one for 
tickets is remarkably sensitive to informa-
tion. Case has a story about that, too. He 
was in Kenmore Square just before game 
four of last year’s playoff series between 
the Yankees and Red Sox. The Red Sox 
had dropped the first three games and 
there was no joy in Mudville. Scalpers were 
unloading tickets for the fourth game for 
only slightly more than face value. Tickets 
for a possible fifth game were going for 
even less.
	
But the Red Sox rallied to win game 
four in extra innings. By 2 that morning, 
said Case, top tickets for game five were 
already selling for more than $1,000 online. 
A bear market had become a bull market 
instantaneously.
	
As defenders of the free market, econo-
mists generally see nothing wrong with 
scalping. “Consenting adults should be able 
to make economic trades when they think 
it is to their mutual advantage,” said Greg 
Mankiw, a Harvard economics professor 
who recently stepped down as chairman 
of President Bush’s Council of Economic 
Advisers. Mankiw has a section about scalp-
ing in his own textbook.
	
Teams could eliminate scalping alto-
gether by holding their own online auctions 
for desirable tickets. Case doesn’t expect 
that to happen. “People would burn down 
Fenway Park if the Red Sox charged $2,000 
for a ticket,” he said. The team would be 
accused of price gouging. Yet if you went 
online last week, you could find front-row 
Green Monster seats for the July 15 game 
against the Yankees selling for more than 
$2,000. Go figure.
	
Case will be at Fenway Park this Friday. 
He is taking his father-in-law to the game. 
He paid a small fortune for the tickets 
online. But he isn’t complaining. It’s the free 
market at work.

learned that the mother’s kidney was not compatible, he proposed a novel solu-
tion: If Stephens donated one of her kidneys to a stranger, her son would move 
to the top of the kidney waiting list. The mother accepted the deal, and soon two 
patients had the transplant they were waiting for.
	
The ingenuity of the doctor’s proposal and the nobility of the mother’s act can-
not be doubted. But the story raises some intriguing questions. If the mother could 
trade a kidney for a kidney, would the hospital allow her to trade a kidney for 
an expensive, experimental cancer treatment that she could not otherwise afford? 
Should she be allowed to exchange her kidney for free tuition for her son at the 
hospital’s medical school? Should she be able to sell her kidney so she can use the 
cash to trade in her old Chevy for a new Lexus?
	
As a matter of public policy, our society makes it illegal for people to sell their 
organs. In essence, in the market for organs, the government has imposed a price 
ceiling of zero. The result, as with any binding price ceiling, is a shortage of the 
good. The deal in the Stephens case did not fall under this prohibition because no 
cash changed hands.
	
Many economists believe that there would be large benefits to allowing a free 
market in organs. People are born with two kidneys, but they usually need only 
one. Meanwhile, a few people suffer from illnesses that leave them without any 
working kidney. Despite the obvious gains from trade, the current situation is 
dire: The typical patient has to wait several years for a kidney transplant, and 
every year thousands of people die because a compatible kidney cannot be found. 
If those needing a kidney were allowed to buy one from those who have two, the 
price would rise to balance supply and demand. Sellers would be better off with 
the extra cash in their pockets. Buyers would be better off with the organ they 
need to save their lives. The shortage of kidneys would disappear.
	
Such a market would lead to an efficient allocation of resources, but critics of 
this plan worry about fairness. A market for organs, they argue, would benefit the 
rich at the expense of the poor because organs would then be allocated to those 
most willing and able to pay. But you can also question the fairness of the current 
system. Now, most of us walk around with an extra organ that we don’t really 
need, while some of our fellow citizens are dying to get one. Is that fair?  ■

Conclusion: Market Efficiency and Market Failure
This chapter introduced the basic tools of welfare economics—consumer and 
producer surplus—and used them to evaluate the efficiency of free markets. We 
showed that the forces of supply and demand allocate resources efficiently. That 
is, even though each buyer and seller in a market is concerned only about his or 
her own welfare, they are together led by an invisible hand to an equilibrium that 
maximizes the total benefits to buyers and sellers.
A word of warning is in order. To conclude that markets are efficient, we made 
several assumptions about how markets work. When these assumptions do not 
hold, our conclusion that the market equilibrium is efficient may no longer be 
true. As we close this chapter, let’s consider briefly two of the most important of 
these assumptions.

CHAPTER 7    Consumers, Producers, and the Efficiency of Markets
Summary 
First, our analysis assumed that markets are perfectly competitive. In the 
world, however, competition is sometimes far from perfect. In some markets, a 
single buyer or seller (or a small group of them) may be able to control market 
prices. This ability to influence prices is called market power. Market power can 
cause markets to be inefficient because it keeps the price and quantity away from 
the equilibrium of supply and demand.
Second, our analysis assumed that the outcome in a market matters only to 
the buyers and sellers in that market. Yet, in the world, the decisions of buyers 
and sellers sometimes affect people who are not participants in the market at all. 
Pollution is the classic example. The use of agricultural pesticides, for instance, 
affects not only the manufacturers who make them and the farmers who use 
them, but many others who breathe air or drink water that has been polluted with 
these pesticides. Such side effects, called externalities, cause welfare in a market 
to depend on more than just the value to the buyers and the cost to the sellers. 
Because buyers and sellers do not consider these side effects when deciding how 
much to consume and produce, the equilibrium in a market can be inefficient 
from the standpoint of society as a whole. 
Market power and externalities are examples of a general phenomenon 
called market failure—the inability of some unregulated markets to allocate 
resources efficiently. When markets fail, public policy can potentially remedy 
the problem and increase economic efficiency. Microeconomists devote much 
effort to studying when market failure is likely and what sorts of policies are 
best at correcting market failures. As you continue your study of economics, 
you will see that the tools of welfare economics developed here are readily 
adapted to that endeavor.
Despite the possibility of market failure, the invisible hand of the mar-
ketplace is extraordinarily important. In many markets, the assumptions 
we made in this chapter work well, and the conclusion of market efficiency 
applies directly. Moreover, we can use our analysis of welfare economics and 
market efficiency to shed light on the effects of various government policies. In 
the next two chapters, we apply the tools we have just developed to study two 
important policy issues—the welfare effects of taxation and of international 
trade.
• Consumer surplus equals buyers’ willingness to 
pay for a good minus the amount they actually 
pay, and it measures the benefit buyers get from 
participating in a market. Consumer surplus 
can be computed by finding the area below the 
demand curve and above the price.
• Producer surplus equals the amount sellers 
receive for their goods minus their costs of pro-
duction, and it measures the benefit sellers get 
from participating in a market. Producer surplus 
can be computed by finding the area below the 
price and above the supply curve.
• An allocation of resources that maximizes the 
sum of consumer and producer surplus is said 
to be efficient. Policymakers are often concerned 
with the efficiency, as well as the equality, of 
economic outcomes.
• The equilibrium of supply and demand maxi-
mizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus. 
That is, the invisible hand of the marketplace leads 
buyers and sellers to allocate resources efficiently.
• Markets do not allocate resources efficiently in 
the presence of market failures such as market 
power or externalities.

e.	 Which provider would you recommend that 
your friend choose? Why?
	11.	 Consider how health insurance affects the 
quantity of healthcare services performed. 
Suppose that the typical medical procedure 
has a cost of $100, yet a person with health 
insurance pays only $20 out of pocket. Her 
insurance company pays the remaining $80.

horizontal axis should represent the number 
of medical procedures.) Show the quantity of 
procedures demanded if each procedure has 
a price of $100. 
b.	On your diagram, show the quantity of 
procedures demanded if consumers pay 
only $20 per procedure. If the cost of each 
procedure to society is truly $100, and if 
individuals have health insurance as just 
described, will the number of procedures 
performed maximize total surplus? Explain.
c.	 Economists often blame the health insurance 
system for excessive use of medical care. 
Given your analysis, why might the use of 
care be viewed as “excessive”?
d.	What sort of policies might prevent this 
excessive use?
