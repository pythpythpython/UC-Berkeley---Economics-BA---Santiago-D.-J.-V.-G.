axes are often a source of heated political debate. In 1776, the anger of the 
American colonists over British taxes sparked the American Revolution. 
More than two centuries later, the American political parties continue to 
debate the proper size and shape of the tax system. Yet no one would 
deny that some level of taxation is necessary. As Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. once 
said, “Taxes are what we pay for civilized society.”
Because taxation has such a major impact on the modern economy, we return 
to the topic several times throughout this book as we expand the set of tools we 
have at our disposal. We began our study of taxes in Chapter 6. There we saw 
how a tax on a good affects its price and the quantity sold and how the forces 
of supply and demand divide the burden of a tax between buyers and sellers. 
In this chapter, we extend this analysis and look at how taxes affect welfare, the 
economic well-being of participants in a market. In other words, we see how high 
the price of civilized society can be.

PART Iii	
Markets and Welfare
The effects of taxes on welfare might at first seem obvious. The government 
enacts taxes to raise revenue and that revenue must come out of someone’s pocket. 
As we saw in Chapter 6, both buyers and sellers are worse off when a good is 
taxed: A tax raises the price buyers pay and lowers the price sellers receive. Yet to 
understand more fully how taxes affect economic well-being, we must compare 
the reduced welfare of buyers and sellers to the amount of revenue the govern-
ment raises. The tools of consumer and producer surplus allow us to make this 
comparison. The analysis will show that the cost of taxes to buyers and sellers 
exceeds the revenue raised by the government.
The Deadweight Loss of Taxation
We begin by recalling one of the surprising lessons from Chapter 6: The outcome 
is the same whether a tax on a good is levied on buyers or sellers of the good. 
When a tax is levied on buyers, the demand curve shifts downward by the size 
of the tax; when it is levied on sellers, the supply curve shifts upward by that 
amount. In either case, when the tax is enacted, the price paid by buyers rises, and 
the price received by sellers falls. In the end, the elasticities of supply and demand 
determine how the tax burden is distributed between producers and consumers. 
This distribution is the same regardless of how it is levied.
Figure 1 shows these effects. To simplify our discussion, this figure does not 
show a shift in either the supply or demand curve, although one curve must shift. 
Which curve shifts depends on whether the tax is levied on sellers (the supply 
curve shifts) or buyers (the demand curve shifts). In this chapter, we can keep the 
analysis general and simplify the graphs by not bothering to show the shift. The 
key result for our purposes here is that the tax places a wedge between the price 
buyers pay and the price sellers receive. Because of this tax wedge, the quantity 
sold falls below the level that would be sold without a tax. In other words, a tax on

CHAPTER 8    Application: The Costs of Taxation
a good causes the size of the market for the good to shrink. These results should 
be familiar from Chapter 6.
How a Tax Affects Market Participants
Let’s use the tools of welfare economics to measure the gains and losses from a 
tax on a good. To do this, we must take into account how the tax affects buyers, 
sellers, and the government. The benefit received by buyers in a market is mea-
sured by consumer surplus—the amount buyers are willing to pay for the good 
minus the amount they actually pay for it. The benefit received by sellers in a 
market is measured by producer surplus—the amount sellers receive for the good 
minus their costs. These are precisely the measures of economic welfare we used 
in Chapter 7.
What about the third interested party, the government? If T is the size of the tax 
and Q is the quantity of the good sold, then the government gets total tax revenue 
of T 3 Q. It can use this tax revenue to provide services, such as roads, police, 
and public education, or to help the needy. Therefore, to analyze how taxes affect 
economic well-being, we use the government’s tax revenue to measure the public 
benefit from the tax. Keep in mind, however, that this benefit actually accrues not 
to the government but to those on whom the revenue is spent.
Figure 2 shows that the government’s tax revenue is represented by the rect-
angle between the supply and demand curves. The height of this rectangle is the 
size of the tax, T, and the width of the rectangle is the quantity of the good sold, 
Q. Because a rectangle’s area is its height times its width, this rectangle’s area is 
T 3 Q, which equals the tax revenue.
Welfare without a Tax  To see how a tax affects welfare, we begin by consider-
ing welfare before the government imposes a tax. Figure 3 shows the supply-and-
demand diagram and marks the key areas with the letters A through F. 
Tax Revenue
The tax revenue that the government 
collects equals T 3 Q, the size of the 
tax T times the quantity sold Q. Thus, 
tax revenue equals the area of the 
rectangle between the supply and 
demand curves.

PART Iii	
Markets and Welfare
Without a tax, the equilibrium price and quantity are found at the intersection 
of the supply and demand curves. The price is P1, and the quantity sold is Q1. 
Because the demand curve reflects buyers’ willingness to pay, consumer surplus 
is the area between the demand curve and the price, A 1 B 1 C. Similarly, because 
the supply curve reflects sellers’ costs, producer surplus is the area between the 
supply curve and the price, D 1 E 1 F. In this case, because there is no tax, tax 
revenue equals zero. 
Total surplus, the sum of consumer and producer surplus, equals the area 
A 1 B 1 C 1 D 1 E 1 F. In other words, as we saw in Chapter 7, total surplus is 
the area between the supply and demand curves up to the equilibrium quantity. 
The first column of the table in Figure 3 summarizes these conclusions.
Welfare with a Tax  Now consider welfare after the tax is enacted. The price 
paid by buyers rises from P1 to PB, so consumer surplus now equals only area A 
(the area below the demand curve and above the buyer’s price). The price received 
by sellers falls from P1 to PS, so producer surplus now equals only area F (the area 
above the supply curve and below the seller’s price). The quantity sold falls from 
Q1 to Q2, and the government collects tax revenue equal to the area B 1 D.
Figure 3
A tax on a good reduces consumer surplus (by the area B 1 C) and producer surplus 
(by the area D 1 E). Because the fall in producer and consumer surplus exceeds tax 
revenue (area B 1 D), the tax is said to impose a deadweight loss (area C 1 E).

CHAPTER 8    Application: The Costs of Taxation
To compute total surplus with the tax, we add consumer surplus, producer 
surplus, and tax revenue. Thus, we find that total surplus is area A 1 B 1 D 1 F. 
The second column of the table summarizes these results.
Changes in Welfare  We can now see the effects of the tax by comparing wel-
fare before and after the tax is enacted. The third column of the table in Figure 3 
shows the changes. The tax causes consumer surplus to fall by the area B 1 C and 
producer surplus to fall by the area D 1 E. Tax revenue rises by the area B 1 D. 
Not surprisingly, the tax makes buyers and sellers worse off and the government 
better off.
The change in total welfare includes the change in consumer surplus (which is 
negative), the change in producer surplus (which is also negative), and the change 
in tax revenue (which is positive). When we add these three pieces together, we find 
that total surplus in the market falls by the area C 1 E. Thus, the losses to buyers and 
sellers from a tax exceed the revenue raised by the government. The fall in total surplus 
that results when a tax (or some other policy) distorts a market outcome is called the 
deadweight loss. The area C 1 E measures the size of the deadweight loss. 
To understand why taxes impose deadweight losses, recall one of the Ten 
Principles of Economics in Chapter 1: People respond to incentives. In Chapter 7, 
we saw that free markets normally allocate scarce resources efficiently. That is, 
the equilibrium of supply and demand maximizes the total surplus of buyers 
and sellers in a market. When a tax raises the price to buyers and lowers the price 
to sellers, however, it gives buyers an incentive to consume less and sellers an 
incentive to produce less than they would in the absence of the tax. As buyers 
and sellers respond to these incentives, the size of the market shrinks below its 
optimum (as shown in the figure by the movement from Q1 to Q2). Thus, because 
taxes distort incentives, they cause markets to allocate resources inefficiently. 
Deadweight Losses and the Gains from Trade
To get some further insight into why taxes result in deadweight losses, consider 
an example. Imagine that Joe cleans Jane’s house each week for $100. The oppor-
tunity cost of Joe’s time is $80, and the value of a clean house to Jane is $120. Thus, 
Joe and Jane each receive a $20 benefit from their deal. The total surplus of $40 
measures the gains from trade in this particular transaction.
Now suppose that the government levies a $50 tax on the providers of cleaning 
services. There is now no price that Jane can pay Joe that will leave both of them 
better off after paying the tax. The most Jane would be willing to pay is $120, but 
then Joe would be left with only $70 after paying the tax, which is less than his 
$80 opportunity cost. Conversely, for Joe to receive his opportunity cost of $80, 
Jane would need to pay $130, which is above the $120 value she places on a clean 
house. As a result, Jane and Joe cancel their arrangement. Joe goes without the 
income, and Jane lives in a dirtier house. 
The tax has made Joe and Jane worse off by a total of $40 because they have 
each lost $20 of surplus. But note that the government collects no revenue from 
Joe and Jane because they decide to cancel their arrangement. The $40 is pure 
deadweight loss: It is a loss to buyers and sellers in a market that is not offset by 
an increase in government revenue. From this example, we can see the ultimate 
source of deadweight losses: Taxes cause deadweight losses because they prevent buyers 
and sellers from realizing some of the gains from trade.
The area of the triangle between the supply and demand curves (area C 1 E in 
Figure 3) measures these losses. This conclusion can be seen more easily in Figure 4

Markets and Welfare
by recalling that the demand curve reflects the value of the good to consumers 
and that the supply curve reflects the costs of producers. When the tax raises the 
price to buyers to PB and lowers the price to sellers to PS, the marginal buyers and 
sellers leave the market, so the quantity sold falls from Q1 to Q2. Yet as the figure 
shows, the value of the good to these buyers still exceeds the cost to these sellers. 
At every quantity between Q1 and Q2, the situation is the same as in our example 
with Joe and Jane. The gains from trade—the difference between buyers’ value 
and sellers’ cost—are less than the tax. As a result, these trades are not made 
once the tax is imposed. The deadweight loss is the surplus lost because the tax 
discourages these mutually advantageous trades.

imposes a tax on cookies, show what happens to the price paid by buyers, the price 
received by sellers, and the quantity sold. In your diagram, show the deadweight loss 
from the tax. Explain the meaning of the deadweight loss.
The Determinants of the Deadweight Loss
What determines whether the deadweight loss from a tax is large or small? The 
answer is the price elasticities of supply and demand, which measure how much 
the quantity supplied and quantity demanded respond to changes in the price. 
Let’s consider first how the elasticity of supply affects the size of the dead-
weight loss. In the top two panels of Figure 5, the demand curve and the size of 
the tax are the same. The only difference in these figures is the elasticity of the 
supply curve. In panel (a), the supply curve is relatively inelastic: Quantity supplied

When the government imposes 
a tax on a good, the quantity

responds only slightly to changes in the price. In panel (b), the supply curve is 
relatively elastic: Quantity supplied responds substantially to changes in the 
price. Notice that the deadweight loss, the area of the triangle between the supply 
and demand curves, is larger when the supply curve is more elastic.
Similarly, the bottom two panels of Figure 5 show how the elasticity of demand 
affects the size of the deadweight loss. Here the supply curve and the size of the 
tax are held constant. In panel (c), the demand curve is relatively inelastic, and the

deadweight loss is small. In panel (d), the demand curve is more elastic, and the 
deadweight loss from the tax is larger. 
The lesson from this figure is apparent. A tax has a deadweight loss because 
it induces buyers and sellers to change their behavior. The tax raises the price 
paid by buyers, so they consume less. At the same time, the tax lowers the price 
received by sellers, so they produce less. Because of these changes in behavior, 
the size of the market shrinks below the optimum. The elasticities of supply and 
demand measure how much sellers and buyers respond to the changes in the 
price and, therefore, determine how much the tax distorts the market outcome. 
Hence, the greater the elasticities of supply and demand, the greater the deadweight loss 
of a tax.
The Deadweight Loss Debate
Supply, demand, elasticity, deadweight loss—all this economic theory is enough 
to make your head spin. But believe it or not, these ideas go to the heart of a pro-
found political question: How big should the government be? The debate hinges 
on these concepts because the larger the deadweight loss of taxation, the larger 
the cost of any government program. If taxation entails large deadweight losses, 
then these losses are a strong argument for a leaner government that does less 
and taxes less. But if taxes impose small deadweight losses, then government 
programs are less costly than they otherwise might be.
	
So how big are the deadweight losses of taxation? Economists disagree on the 
answer to this question. To see the nature of this disagreement, consider the most 
important tax in the U.S. economy: the tax on labor. The Social Security tax, the 
Medicare tax, and to a large extent, the federal income tax are labor taxes. Many 
state governments also tax labor earnings. A labor tax places a wedge between the 
wage that firms pay and the wage that workers receive. For a typical worker, if all 
forms of labor taxes are added together, the marginal tax rate on labor income—the 
tax on the last dollar of earnings—is about 40 percent. 
	
Although the size of the labor tax is easy to determine, the deadweight loss of 
this tax is less straightforward. Economists disagree about whether this 40 percent 
labor tax has a small or a large deadweight loss. This disagreement arises because 
economists hold different views about the elasticity of labor supply.
	
Economists who argue that labor taxes do not greatly distort market outcomes 
believe that labor supply is fairly inelastic. Most people, they claim, would work 
full time regardless of the wage. If so, the labor supply curve is almost vertical, 
and a tax on labor has a small deadweight loss.
	
Economists who argue that labor taxes are highly distorting believe that labor 
supply is more elastic. While admitting that some groups of workers may supply 
their labor inelastically, these economists claim that many other groups respond 
more to incentives. Here are some examples:
• 	 Many workers can adjust the number of hours they work—for instance, 
by working overtime. The higher the wage, the more hours they choose to 
work.
• 	 Some families have second earners—often married women with children—
with some discretion over whether to do unpaid work at home or paid  
work in the marketplace. When deciding whether to take a job, these second

CHAPTER 8    Application: The Costs of Taxation
earners compare the benefits of being at home (including savings on the cost 
of child care) with the wages they could earn. 
• 	 Many of the elderly can choose when to retire, and their decisions are partly 
based on the wage. Once they are retired, the wage determines their incen-
tive to work part time.
• 	 Some people consider engaging in illegal economic activity, such as the 
drug trade, or working at jobs that pay “under the table” to evade taxes. 
Economists call this the underground economy. In deciding whether to work 
in the underground economy or at a legitimate job, these potential criminals 
compare what they can earn by breaking the law with the wage they can 
earn legally.
In each of these cases, the quantity of labor supplied responds to the wage (the 
price of labor). Thus, these workers’ decisions are distorted when their labor 
earnings are taxed. Labor taxes encourage workers to work fewer hours, second 
earners to stay at home, the elderly to retire early, and the unscrupulous to enter 
the underground economy.
	
These two views of labor taxation persist to this day. Indeed, whenever you see 
two political candidates debating whether the government should provide more 
services or reduce the tax burden, keep in mind that part of the disagreement may 
rest on different views about the elasticity of labor supply and the deadweight 
loss of taxation.  ■

Deadweight Loss and Tax Revenue as Taxes Vary
Taxes rarely stay the same for long periods of time. Policymakers in local, state, 
and federal governments are always considering raising one tax or lowering 
another. Here we consider what happens to the deadweight loss and tax revenue 
when the size of a tax changes.
Figure 6 shows the effects of a small, medium, and large tax, holding constant 
the market’s supply and demand curves. The deadweight loss—the reduction 
in total surplus that results when the tax reduces the size of a market below 
the optimum—equals the area of the triangle between the supply and demand 
curves. For the small tax in panel (a), the area of the deadweight loss triangle is 
quite small. But as the size of a tax rises in panels (b) and (c), the deadweight loss 
grows larger and larger.
Indeed, the deadweight loss of a tax rises even more rapidly than the size of 
the tax. This occurs because the deadweight loss is an area of a triangle, and the 
area of a triangle depends on the square of its size. If we double the size of a tax, 
for instance, the base and height of the triangle double, so the deadweight loss 
rises by a factor of 4. If we triple the size of a tax, the base and height triple, so the 
deadweight loss rises by a factor of 9.
The government’s tax revenue is the size of the tax times the amount of the 
good sold. As the first three panels of Figure 6 show, tax revenue equals the area 
of the rectangle between the supply and demand curves. For the small tax in panel 
(a), tax revenue is small. As the size of a tax increases from panel (a) to panel (b),

tax revenue grows. But as the size of the tax increases further from panel (b) to 
panel (c), tax revenue falls because the higher tax drastically reduces the size 
of the market. For a very large tax, no revenue would be raised because people 
would stop buying and selling the good altogether.
The last two panels of Figure 6 summarize these results. In panel (d), we see that 
as the size of a tax increases, its deadweight loss quickly gets larger. By contrast, 
Figure 6
The deadweight loss is the reduction in total surplus due to the tax. Tax revenue 
is the amount of the tax times the amount of the good sold. In panel (a), a small 
tax has a small deadweight loss and raises a small amount of revenue. In panel (b), 
a somewhat larger tax has a larger deadweight loss and raises a larger amount of 
revenue. In panel (c), a very large tax has a very large deadweight loss, but because 
it has reduced the size of the market so much, the tax raises only a small amount of 
revenue. Panels (d) and (e) summarize these conclusions. Panel (d) shows that as the 
size of a tax grows larger, the deadweight loss grows larger. Panel (e) shows that 
tax revenue first rises and then falls. This relationship is sometimes called the Laffer

panel (e) shows that tax revenue first rises with the size of the tax, but as the tax 
gets larger, the market shrinks so much that tax revenue starts to fall.
The Laffer Curve and Supply-Side Economics
One day in 1974, economist Arthur Laffer sat in a Washington restaurant with 
some prominent journalists and politicians. He took out a napkin and drew a figure 
on it to show how tax rates affect tax revenue. It looked much like panel (e) of 
our Figure 6. Laffer then suggested that the United States was on the downward-
sloping side of this curve. Tax rates were so high, he argued, that reducing them 
would actually increase tax revenue.
	
Most economists were skeptical of Laffer’s suggestion. The idea that a cut in tax 
rates could increase tax revenue was correct as a matter of economic theory, but 
there was more doubt about whether it would do so in practice. There was little evi-
dence for Laffer’s view that U.S. tax rates had in fact reached such extreme levels.
	
Nonetheless, the Laffer curve (as it became known) captured the imagination of 
Ronald Reagan. David Stockman, budget director in the first Reagan administra-
tion, offers the following story:
[Reagan] had once been on the Laffer curve himself. “I came into the Big Money 
making pictures during World War II,” he would always say. At that time the 
wartime income surtax hit 90 percent. “You could only make four pictures and 
then you were in the top bracket,” he would continue. “So we all quit work-
ing after four pictures and went off to the country.” High tax rates caused less 
work. Low tax rates caused more. His experience proved it.
	
When Reagan ran for president in 1980, he made cutting taxes part of his plat-
form. Reagan argued that taxes were so high that they were discouraging hard 
work. He argued that lower taxes would give people the proper incentive to work, 
which would raise economic well-being and perhaps even tax revenue. Because 
the cut in tax rates was intended to encourage people to increase the quantity of 
labor they supplied, the views of Laffer and Reagan became known as supply-side 
economics.
	
Economists continue to debate Laffer’s argument. Many believe that sub­
sequent history refuted Laffer’s conjecture that lower tax rates would raise tax 
revenue. Yet because history is open to alternative interpretations, other econo-
mists view the events of the 1980s as more favorable to the supply siders. To 
evaluate Laffer’s hypothesis definitively, we would need to rerun history without 
the Reagan tax cuts and see if tax revenues were higher or lower. Unfortunately, 
that experiment is impossible. 
	
Some economists take an intermediate position on this issue. They believe 
that while an overall cut in tax rates normally reduces revenue, some taxpayers 
at some times may find themselves on the wrong side of the Laffer curve. Other 
things equal, a tax cut is more likely to raise tax revenue if the cut applies to those 
taxpayers facing the highest tax rates. In addition, Laffer’s argument may be 
more compelling when considering countries with much higher tax rates than the 
United States. In Sweden in the early 1980s, for instance, the typical worker faced 
a marginal tax rate of about 80 percent. Such a high tax rate provides a substantial 
disincentive to work. Studies have suggested that Sweden would indeed have 
raised more tax revenue if it had lowered its tax rates.

Markets and Welfare
	
Economists disagree about these issues in part because there is no consensus 
about the size of the relevant elasticities. The more elastic supply and demand are 
in any market, the more taxes in the market distort behavior, and the more likely 
it is that a tax cut will increase tax revenue. There is no debate, however, about 
the general lesson: How much revenue the government gains or loses from a tax 
change cannot be computed just by looking at tax rates. It also depends on how 
the tax change affects people’s behavior.  ■

Conclusion
In this chapter we have used the tools developed in the previous chapter to further 
our understanding of taxes. One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in 
Chapter 1 is that markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity. In

ECB Paper Looks at 
U.S., Europe Spots on 
the Laffer Curve
By Brian Blackstone
E
conomist Arthur Laffer’s theory is that, 
after a certain point, tax increases become 
self-defeating by weakening economic 
growth and draining tax revenues. There are 
two points—zero and 100%—where the 
government receives no revenue. The trick is 
finding the peak point between the two.
	
The Laffer curve served as an intel-
lectual foundation for large-scale tax cuts 
in the U.S. in the early 1980s. Now, the 
U.S. is on the “left side” of the Laffer curve 
even more so than Europe, especially when 
it comes to labor taxes, meaning higher tax 
rates would still bring in added revenues, a 
European Central Bank paper concludes.
	
“We find that the U.S. can increase tax 
revenues by 30% by raising labor taxes but 
only 6% by raising capital income taxes, 
while the same numbers for EU-14 are 
8% and 1% respectively,” ECB economist 
Mathias Trabandt and University of Chicago 
economist Harald Uhlig wrote. Germany 
could raise about another 10% in revenues 
by increasing labor taxes, they estimate, but 
just 2% via capital taxes.
	
Only 32% of a cut in U.S. labor taxes 
would be self-financed, the economists 
note, versus 54% self-financing in Europe. 
Just over 50% of a cut in U.S. capital taxes 
would pay for itself, the authors estimate, 
versus 79% in Europe.
	
“In terms of a ‘Laffer hill’, both the 
U.S. and the EU-14 are on the left side of 
the peak with respect to their capital tax 
rates,” the authors wrote. But in the case 
of Denmark and Sweden, “these countries 
are on the ‘slippery side’ of the Laffer curve 
and can actually improve their budgetary 
situation by cutting capital taxes, according 
to our calculations,” they wrote.

CHAPTER 8    Application: The Costs of Taxation
Chapter 7, we used the concepts of producer and consumer surplus to make this 
principle more precise. Here we have seen that when the government imposes 
taxes on buyers or sellers of a good, society loses some of the benefits of market 
efficiency. Taxes are costly to market participants not only because taxes transfer 
resources from those participants to the government but also because they alter 
incentives and distort market outcomes.
The analysis presented here and in Chapter 6 should give you a good basis for 
understanding the economic impact of taxes, but this is not the end of the story. 
Microeconomists study how best to design a tax system, including how to strike 
the right balance between equality and efficiency. Macroeconomists study how 
taxes influence the overall economy and how policymakers can use the tax system 
to stabilize economic activity and to achieve more rapid economic growth. So as 
you continue your study of economics, don’t be surprised when the subject of 
taxation comes up yet again.
• A tax on a good reduces the welfare of buyers 
and sellers of the good, and the reduction in 
consumer and producer surplus usually exceeds 
the revenue raised by the government. The fall 
in total surplus—the sum of consumer surplus, 
producer surplus, and tax revenue—is called the 
deadweight loss of the tax.
• Taxes have deadweight losses because they cause 
buyers to consume less and sellers to produce less, 
and these changes in behavior shrink the size of 
the market below the level that maximizes total 
surplus. Because the elasticities of supply and 
demand measure how much market participants 
respond to market conditions, larger elasticities 
imply larger deadweight losses.
• As a tax grows larger, it distorts incentives more, 
and its deadweight loss grows larger. Because a 
tax reduces the size of the market, however, tax 
revenue does not continually increase. It first 
rises with the size of a tax, but if a tax gets large 
enough, tax revenue starts to fall.

PART Iii	
Markets and Welfare
	 1.	 The market for pizza is characterized by a 
downward-sloping demand curve and an 
upward-sloping supply curve.
a.	 Draw the competitive market equilibrium. 
Label the price, quantity, consumer 
surplus, and producer surplus. Is there any 
deadweight loss? Explain.
b.	Suppose that the government forces each 
pizzeria to pay a $1 tax on each pizza sold. 
Illustrate the effect of this tax on the pizza 
market, being sure to label the consumer 
surplus, producer surplus, government 
revenue, and deadweight loss. How does 
each area compare to the pre-tax case?
c.	 If the tax were removed, pizza eaters and sellers 
would be better off, but the government would 
lose tax revenue. Suppose that consumers and 
producers voluntarily transferred some of their 
gains to the government. Could all parties 
(including the government) be better off than 
they were with a tax? Explain using the labeled 
areas in your graph.
	 2.	 Evaluate the following two statements. Do you 
agree? Why or why not?
a.	 “A tax that has no deadweight loss cannot 
raise any revenue for the government.”
b.	“A tax that raises no revenue for the 
government cannot have any deadweight 
loss.”
	 3.	 Consider the market for rubber bands.
a.	 If this market has very elastic supply and 
very inelastic demand, how would the 
burden of a tax on rubber bands be shared 
between consumers and producers? Use 
the tools of consumer surplus and producer 
surplus in your answer.
b.	If this market has very inelastic supply and 
very elastic demand, how would the burden 
of a tax on rubber bands be shared between 
consumers and producers? Contrast your 
answer with your answer to part (a).
	 4.	 Suppose that the government imposes a tax on 
heating oil.
a.	 Would the deadweight loss from this tax 
likely be greater in the first year after it is 
imposed or in the fifth year? Explain.
b.	Would the revenue collected from this tax 
likely be greater in the first year after it is 
imposed or in the fifth year? Explain.
	 5.	 After economics class one day, your friend 
suggests that taxing food would be a good way 
to raise revenue because the demand for food 
is quite inelastic. In what sense is taxing food a 
“good” way to raise revenue? In what sense is it 
not a “good” way to raise revenue?
	 6.	 Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the late senator from 
New York, once introduced a bill that would 
levy a 10,000 percent tax on certain hollow-
tipped bullets.
a.	 Do you expect that this tax would raise much 
revenue? Why or why not?
b.	Even if the tax would raise no revenue,  
why might Senator Moynihan have  
proposed it?
	 7.	 The government places a tax on the purchase of 
socks.
a.	 Illustrate the effect of this tax on equilibrium 
price and quantity in the sock market. 
Identify the following areas both before and 
after the imposition of the tax: total spending 
by consumers, total revenue for producers, 
and government tax revenue.
b.	Does the price received by producers rise or 
fall? Can you tell whether total receipts for 
producers rise or fall? Explain.
c.	 Does the price paid by consumers rise or 
fall? Can you tell whether total spending by 
consumers rises or falls? Explain carefully. 
(Hint: Think about elasticity.) If total 
consumer spending falls, does consumer 
surplus rise? Explain.
	 8.	 Suppose the government currently raises $100 
million through a 1-cent tax on widgets, and 
another $100 million through a 10-cent tax on 
gadgets. If the government doubled the tax rate 
on widgets and eliminated the tax on gadgets, 
would it raise more tax revenue than it does 
today, less tax revenue, or the same amount? 
Explain.
	 9.	 This chapter analyzed the welfare effects of 
a tax on a good. Consider now the opposite 
policy. Suppose that the government subsidizes 
a good: For each unit of the good sold, the 
government pays $2 to the buyer. How does 
the subsidy affect consumer surplus, producer 
surplus, tax revenue, and total surplus?  
Does a subsidy lead to a deadweight loss? 
Explain.

CHAPTER 8    Application: The Costs of Taxation
	10.	 Hotel rooms in Smalltown go for $100, and 
1,000 rooms are rented on a typical day. 
a.	 To raise revenue, the mayor decides to charge 
hotels a tax of $10 per rented room. After 
the tax is imposed, the going rate for hotel 
rooms rises to $108, and the number of rooms 
rented falls to 900. Calculate the amount of 
revenue this tax raises for Smalltown and the 
deadweight loss of the tax. (Hint: The area of 
a triangle is 1⁄2 3 base 3 height.)
b.	The mayor now doubles the tax to $20. The 
price rises to $116, and the number of rooms 
rented falls to 800. Calculate tax revenue 
and deadweight loss with this larger tax. Do 
they double, more than double, or less than 
double? Explain.
	11.	 Suppose that a market is described by the 
following supply and demand equations:
QS 5 2P
QD 5 300 – P
a.	 Solve for the equilibrium price and the 
equilibrium quantity.
b.	Suppose that a tax of T is placed on buyers, 
so the new demand equation is
QD 5 300 – (P 1 T). 
	
Solve for the new equilibrium. What happens 
to the price received by sellers, the price paid 
by buyers, and the quantity sold?
c.	 Tax revenue is T 3 Q. Use your answer to 
part (b) to solve for tax revenue as a function 
of T. Graph this relationship for T between 0 
and 300.
d.	The deadweight loss of a tax is the area of 
the triangle between the supply and demand 
curves. Recalling that the area of a triangle  
is 1⁄2 3 base 3 height, solve for deadweight 
loss as a function of T. Graph this relationship 
for T between 0 and 300. (Hint: Looking 
sideways, the base of the deadweight loss 
triangle is T, and the height is the difference 
between the quantity sold with the tax and 
the quantity sold without the tax.) 
e.	 The government now levies a tax on this 
good of $200 per unit. Is this a good policy? 
Why or why not? Can you propose a better 
policy?
