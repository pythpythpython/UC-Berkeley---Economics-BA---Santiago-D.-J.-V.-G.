Six Debates over 
Macroeconomic Policy
I
t is hard to open up the newspaper without finding some politician or edi-
torial writer advocating a change in economic policy. The president should 
raise taxes to reduce the budget deficit, or he should stop worrying about the 
budget deficit. The Federal Reserve should cut interest rates to stimulate a 
flagging economy, or it should avoid such moves in order not to risk higher infla-
tion. Congress should reform the tax system to promote faster economic growth, 
or it should reform the tax system to achieve a more equal distribution of income. 
Such economic issues are central to the continuing political debate in the United 
States and other countries around the world. 
Previous chapters have developed the tools that economists use to analyze the 
behavior of the economy as a whole and the impact of policies on the economy. 
This final chapter considers six classic questions about macroeconomic policy. 
Economists have long debated these questions, and they will likely continue to 
do so for years to come. The knowledge you have accumulated in this course

provides the foundation with which we can discuss these important, unsettled 
issues. It should help you choose a side in these debates or, at least, help you see 
why choosing a side is so difficult.
Should Monetary and Fiscal Policymakers Try to  
Stabilize the Economy?
In the preceding three chapters, we saw how changes in aggregate demand and 
aggregate supply can lead to short-run fluctuations in production and employ-
ment. We also saw how monetary and fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand 
and, thereby, influence these fluctuations. But even if policymakers can influence 
short-run economic fluctuations, does that mean they should? Our first debate 
concerns whether monetary and fiscal policymakers should use the tools at their 
disposal in an attempt to smooth the ups and downs of the business cycle.
Pro: Policymakers Should Try to  
Stabilize the Economy
Left on their own, economies tend to fluctuate. When households and firms 
become pessimistic, for instance, they cut back on spending, and this reduces 
the aggregate demand for goods and services. The fall in aggregate demand, in 
turn, reduces the production of goods and services. Firms lay off workers, and 
the unemployment rate rises. Real GDP and other measures of income fall. Ris-
ing unemployment and falling income help confirm the pessimism that initially 
generated the economic downturn. 
Such a recession has no benefit for society—it represents a sheer waste of 
resources. Workers who lose their jobs because of declining aggregate demand 
would rather be working. Business owners whose factories are idle during a reces-
sion would rather be producing valuable goods and services and selling them at 
a profit. 
There is no reason for society to suffer through the booms and busts of the 
business cycle. The development of macroeconomic theory has shown policymak-
ers how to reduce the severity of economic fluctuations. By “leaning against the 
wind” of economic change, monetary and fiscal policy can stabilize aggregate 
demand and, thereby, production and employment. When aggregate demand is 
inadequate to ensure full employment, policymakers should boost government 
spending, cut taxes, and expand the money supply. When aggregate demand is 
excessive, risking higher inflation, policymakers should cut government spend-
ing, raise taxes, and reduce the money supply. Such policy actions put macroeco-
nomic theory to its best use by leading to a more stable economy, which benefits 
everyone. 
Con: Policymakers Should Not Try to  
Stabilize the Economy
Monetary and fiscal policy can be used to stabilize the economy in theory, but 
there are substantial obstacles to the use of such policies in practice. 
One problem is that monetary and fiscal policy do not affect the economy 
immediately but instead work with a long lag. Monetary policy affects aggregate

demand primarily by changing interest rates, which in turn affect spending, par-
ticularly residential and business investment. But many households and firms set 
their spending plans in advance. As a result, it takes time for changes in interest 
rates to alter the aggregate demand for goods and services. Many studies indi-
cate that changes in monetary policy have little effect on aggregate demand until 
about six months after the change is made.
Fiscal policy works with a lag because of the long political process that governs 
changes in spending and taxes. To make any change in fiscal policy, a bill must 
go through congressional committees, pass both the House and the Senate, and 
be signed by the president. It can take years to propose, pass, and implement a 
major change in fiscal policy.
Because of these long lags, policymakers who want to stabilize the economy 
need to look ahead to economic conditions that are likely to prevail when their 
actions will take effect. Unfortunately, economic forecasting is highly imprecise, 
in part because macroeconomics is such a primitive science and in part because 
the shocks that cause economic fluctuations are intrinsically unpredictable. Thus, 
when policymakers change monetary or fiscal policy, they must rely on educated 
guesses about future economic conditions.
Too often, policymakers trying to stabilize the economy do just the opposite. 
Economic conditions can easily change between the time a policy action begins 
and the time it takes effect. Because of this, policymakers can inadvertently 
exacerbate rather than mitigate the magnitude of economic fluctuations. Some 
economists have claimed that many of the major economic fluctuations in history, 
including the Great Depression of the 1930s, can be traced to destabilizing policy 
actions. 
One of the first rules taught to physicians is “do no harm.” The human body 
has natural restorative powers. Confronted with a sick patient and an uncertain 
diagnosis, often a doctor should do nothing but leave the patient’s body to its own 
devices. Intervening in the absence of reliable knowledge merely risks making 
matters worse.

The same can be said about treating an ailing economy. It might be desirable if 
policymakers could eliminate all economic fluctuations, but that is not a realistic 
goal given the limits of macroeconomic knowledge and the inherent unpredict-
ability of world events. Economic policymakers should refrain from intervening 
often with monetary and fiscal policy and be content if they do no harm.
QUICK QUIZ  Explain why monetary and fiscal policy work with a lag. Why do these 
lags matter in the choice between active and passive policy?
Should the Government Fight Recessions with  
Spending Hikes Rather Than Tax Cuts?
When George W. Bush became President in 2001, the economy was slipping into 
a recession. He responded by cutting tax rates. When Barack Obama became 
President in 2009, the economy was again in recession, the worst in many decades. 
He responded with a stimulus package that offered some tax reductions but also 
included substantial increases in government spending. The contrast between 
these two policies illustrates a second classic question of macroeconomics: Which 
instrument of fiscal policy—government spending or taxes—is better for reducing 
the severity of economic downturns?
Pro: The Government Should Fight Recessions with 
Spending Hikes
John Maynard Keynes transformed economics when he wrote The General Theory 
of Employment, Interest and Money in the midst of the Great Depression of 1930s, 
the worst economic downturn in U.S. history. Since then, economists have under-
stood that the fundamental problem during recessions is inadequate aggregate 
demand. When firms are unable to sell a sufficient quantity of goods and ser-
vices, they reduce production and employment. The key to ending recessions is 
to restore aggregate demand to a level consistent with full employment of the 
economy’s labor force.
To be sure, monetary policy is the first line of defense against economic down-
turns. By increasing the money supply, the central bank reduces interest rates. Lower 
interest rates in turn reduce the cost of borrowing to finance investment projects, 
such as new factories and new housing. Increased spending on investment adds to 
aggregate demand and helps to restore normal levels of production and employment.
Fiscal policy, however, can provide an additional tool to combat recessions. 
When the government cuts taxes, it increases households’ disposable income, 
which encourages them to increase spending on consumption. When the govern-
ment buys goods and services, it adds directly to aggregate demand. Moreover, 
these fiscal actions can have multiplier effects: Higher aggregate demand leads to 
higher incomes, which in turn induces additional consumer spending and further 
increases in aggregate demand.
Fiscal policy is particularly useful when the tools of monetary policy lose their 
effectiveness. During the economic downturn of 2008 and 2009, for example, the 
Federal Reserve cut its target interest rate to almost zero. The Fed cannot reduce 
interest rates below zero, because people would hold onto their cash rather than 
lending it out at a negative interest rate. Thus, once interest rates are at zero, the 
Roadside signs advertised the 
jobs created by the stimulus  
bill President Obama signed 
into law.

Fed has lost its most powerful tool for stimulating the economy. In this circum-
stance, it is natural for the government to turn to fiscal policy—taxes and govern-
ment spending—to prop up aggregate demand.
Traditional Keynesian analysis indicates that increases in government purchases 
are a more potent tool than decreases in taxes. When the government gives a dollar 
in tax cuts to a household, part of that dollar may be saved rather than spent. (That is 
especially true if households view the tax reduction as temporary rather than perma-
nent.) The part of the dollar that is saved does not contribute to the aggregate demand 
for goods and services. By contrast, when the government spends a dollar buying a 
good or service, that dollar immediately and fully adds to aggregate demand.
In 2009, economists in the Obama administration used a conventional macro­
economic model to calculate the magnitude of these effects. According to their 
computer simulations, each dollar of tax cuts increases GDP by $0.99, whereas 
each dollar of government purchases increases GDP by $1.59. Thus, increases in 
government spending offer a bigger “bang for the buck” than decreases in taxes. 
For this reason, the policy response in 2009 featured fewer federal tax cuts and 
more increases in federal spending.
Policymakers focused on three kinds of spending. First, there was spending 
on “shovel-ready” projects. These were public works projects such as repairs to 
highways and bridges on which construction could begin immediately, putting 
the unemployed back to work. Second, there was federal aid to state and local 
governments. Because many of these governments are constitutionally required 
to run balanced budgets, falling tax revenues during recessions can make it neces-
sary for them to lay off teachers, police, and other public workers; federal aid pre-
vented that outcome or, at least, reduced its severity. Third, there were increased 
payments to the jobless through the unemployment insurance system. Because 
the unemployed are often financially stretched, they were thought to be likely 
to spend rather than save this extra income. Thus, these transfer payments were 
thought to contribute more to aggregate demand—and thereby production and 
employment—than tax cuts would. According to the macroeconomic model used 
by the Obama administration, the $800 billion stimulus package would create or 
save more than 3 million jobs by the end of the president’s second year in office.
It is impossible to know for sure what effect the stimulus in fact had. Because 
we get only one run at history, we cannot observe the counterfactual—the same 
economy without the stimulus package. One thing is clear: While the economic 
downturn of 2008–2009 was severe, it could have been worse. As judged by the 
fall in GDP or rise in unemployment, it did not approach the magnitude of the 
Great Depression of the 1930s. 
Con: The Government Should Fight  
Recessions with Tax Cuts
There is a long tradition of using tax policy to stimulate a moribund economy. 
President Kennedy proposed a tax reduction as one of his major economic initia-
tives; it eventually passed under President Johnson in 1964. President Reagan also 
signed into law significant tax cuts when he became president in 1981. Both of 
these tax reductions were soon followed by robust economic growth.
Tax cuts have important influence on both aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply. They increase aggregate demand by increasing households’ disposable 
income, as emphasized in traditional Keynesian analysis. But they can also increase 
aggregate demand by altering incentives. For example, if the tax reductions take

the form of an expanded investment tax credit, they can induce increased spend-
ing on investment goods. Because investment spending is the most volatile com-
ponent of GDP over the business cycle, stimulating investment is a key to ending 
recessions. Policymakers can target it specifically with well-designed tax policy.
At the same time that tax cuts increase aggregate demand, they can also 
increase aggregate supply. When the government reduces marginal tax rates, 
workers keep a higher fraction of any income they earn. As a result, the unem-
ployed have a greater incentive to search for jobs, and the employed have a 
greater incentive to work longer hours. Increased aggregate supply, along with 
the increased aggregate demand, means that the production of goods and services 
can expand without putting upward pressure on the rate of inflation.
There are various problems with increasing government spending during 
recessions. First of all, consumers understand that higher government spending, 
together with the government borrowing needed to finance it, will likely lead to 
higher taxes in the future. The anticipation of those future taxes will induce con-
sumers to cut back spending today. Moreover, like most taxes, those in the future 
will likely cause a variety of deadweight losses. As businesses look ahead to a more 
highly distorted future economy, they may reduce their expectations of future 
profits and reduce investment spending today. Because of these various effects, 
government-spending multipliers may be smaller than is conventionally believed.
It is also far from clear whether the government can spend money both wisely 
and quickly. Large government spending projects often require years of planning, 
as policymakers and voters weigh the costs and benefits of the many alternative 
courses of action. By contrast, when unemployment soars during recessions, the 
need for additional aggregate demand is immediate. If the government increases 
spending quickly, it may end up buying things of little public value. But if it tries 
to be careful and deliberate in planning its expenditures, it may fail to increase 
aggregate demand in a timely fashion. 
Tax cuts have the advantage of decentralizing spending decisions, rather than 
relying on a centralized and highly imperfect political process. Households spend 
their disposable income on things they value. Firms spend their investment dol-
lars on projects they expect to be profitable. By contrast, when the government 
tries to spend large sums of money fast, subject to various political pressures, it 
may end up building “bridges to nowhere.” Ill-conceived public projects may 
employ some workers, but they create little lasting value. Moreover, they will 
leave future generations of taxpayers with significant additional debts. In the end, 
the short-run benefits of additional aggregate demand from increased govern-
ment spending may fail to compensate for the long-run costs.
QUICK QUIZ  According to traditional Keynesian analysis, which has a larger impact 
on GDP—a dollar of tax cuts or a dollar of additional government spending? Why?
Should Monetary Policy Be Made by Rule Rather  
Than by Discretion?
As we learned in the chapter on the monetary system, the Federal Open Market 
Committee sets monetary policy in the United States. The committee meets about 
every six weeks to evaluate the state of the economy. Based on this evaluation

and forecasts of future economic conditions, it chooses whether to raise, lower, 
or leave unchanged the level of short-term interest rates. The Fed then adjusts 
the money supply to reach that interest-rate target, which will normally remain 
unchanged until the next meeting.
The Federal Open Market Committee operates with almost complete discretion 
over how to conduct monetary policy. The laws that created the Fed give the insti-
tution only vague recommendations about what goals it should pursue. A 1977 
amendment to the 1913 Federal Reserve Act said the Fed “shall maintain long run 
growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s 
long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals 
of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” 
But the act does not specify how to weight these various goals, nor does it tell the 
Fed how to pursue whatever objective it might choose.
Some economists are critical of this institutional design. Our third debate over 
macroeconomic policy, therefore, focuses on whether the Federal Reserve should 
have its discretionary powers reduced and, instead, be committed to following a 
rule for how it conducts monetary policy.
Pro: Monetary Policy Should Be Made by Rule
Discretion in the conduct of monetary policy has two problems. The first is that 
it does not limit incompetence and abuse of power. When the government sends 
police into a community to maintain civic order, it gives them strict guidelines 
about how to carry out their job. Because police have great power, allowing them 
to exercise that power in whatever way they want would be dangerous. Yet when 
the government gives central bankers the authority to maintain economic order, 
it gives them few guidelines. Monetary policymakers are allowed undisciplined 
discretion.
As an example of the abuse of power, central bankers are sometimes tempted 
to use monetary policy to affect the outcome of elections. Suppose that the vote 
for the incumbent president is based on economic conditions at the time he or 
she is up for reelection. A central banker sympathetic to the incumbent might 
be tempted to pursue expansionary policies just before the election to stimulate 
production and employment, knowing that the resulting inflation will not show 
up until after the election. Thus, to the extent that central bankers ally themselves 
with politicians, discretionary policy can lead to economic fluctuations that reflect 
the electoral calendar. Economists call such fluctuations the political business cycle. 
The second, subtler problem with discretionary monetary policy is that it might 
lead to more inflation than is desirable. Central bankers, knowing that there is 
no long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment, often announce that 
their goal is zero inflation. Yet they rarely achieve price stability. Why? Perhaps 
it is because, once the public forms expectations of inflation, policymakers face a 
short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. They are tempted to 
renege on their announcement of price stability to achieve lower unemployment. 
This discrepancy between announcements (what policymakers say they are going 
to do) and actions (what they subsequently in fact do) is called the time inconsist-
ency of policy. Because policymakers are so often time inconsistent, people are 
skeptical when central bankers announce their intentions to reduce the rate of 
inflation. As a result, people always expect more inflation than monetary policy-
makers claim they are trying to achieve. Higher expectations of inflation, in turn, 
shift the short-run Phillips curve upward, making the short-run trade-off between 
inflation and unemployment less favorable than it otherwise might be.

## Page 818

One way to avoid these two problems with discretionary policy is to commit 
the central bank to a policy rule. For example, suppose that Congress passed a 
law requiring the Fed to increase the money supply by exactly 3 percent per year. 
(Why 3 percent? Because real GDP grows on average about 3 percent per year 
and because money demand grows with real GDP, 3 percent growth in the money 
supply is roughly the rate necessary to produce long-run price stability.) Such a 
law would eliminate incompetence and abuse of power on the part of the Fed, and 
it would make the political business cycle impossible. In addition, policy could no 
longer be time inconsistent. People would now believe the Fed’s announcement of 
low inflation because the Fed would be legally required to pursue a low-inflation 
monetary policy. With low expected inflation, the economy would face a more 
favorable short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment.
Other rules for monetary policy are also possible. A more active rule might 
allow some feedback from the state of the economy to changes in monetary pol-
icy. For example, a more active rule might require the Fed to increase monetary 
growth by 1 percentage point for every percentage point that unemployment 
rises above its natural rate. Regardless of the precise form of the rule, committing 
the Fed to some rule would yield advantages by limiting incompetence, abuse of 
power, and time inconsistency in the conduct of monetary policy. 
Con: Monetary Policy Should Not Be Made by Rule
There may be pitfalls with discretionary monetary policy, but there is also an impor-
tant advantage to it: flexibility. The Fed has to confront various circumstances, not 
all of which can be foreseen. In the 1930s, banks failed in record numbers. In the 
1970s, the price of oil skyrocketed around the world. In October 1987, the stock mar-
ket fell by 22 percent in a single day. From 2007 to 2009, house prices dropped, home 
foreclosures soared, and the financial system experienced significant problems. The 
Fed must decide how to respond to these shocks to the economy. A designer of a 
policy rule could not possibly consider all the contingencies and specify in advance 
the right policy response. It is better to appoint good people to conduct monetary 
policy and then give them the freedom to do the best they can.
Moreover, the alleged problems with discretion are largely hypothetical. The 
practical importance of the political business cycle, for instance, is far from clear. 
In some cases, just the opposite seems to occur. For example, President Jimmy 
Carter appointed Paul Volcker to head the Federal Reserve in 1979. Nonetheless, 
in October of that year, Volcker switched to a contractionary monetary policy to 
combat the high rate of inflation that he had inherited from his predecessor. The 
predictable result of Volcker’s decision was a recession, and the predictable result 
of the recession was a decline in Carter’s popularity. Rather than using monetary 
policy to help the president who had appointed him, Volcker took actions he 
thought were in the national interest, even though they helped to ensure Carter’s 
defeat by Ronald Reagan in the November 1980 election.
The practical importance of time inconsistency is also far from clear. Although 
most people are skeptical of central-bank announcements, central bankers can 
achieve credibility over time by backing up their words with actions. In the 1990s, 
the Fed achieved and maintained a low rate of inflation, despite the ever-present 
temptation to take advantage of the short-run trade-off between inflation and 
unemployment. This experience shows that low inflation does not require that the 
Fed be committed to a policy rule.
Any attempt to replace discretion with a rule must confront the difficult 
task of specifying a precise rule. Despite much research examining the costs

and benefits of alternative rules, economists have not reached consensus 
about what a good rule would be. Until there is consensus, society has little 
choice but to give central bankers discretion to conduct monetary policy as 
they see fit. 
QUICK QUIZ  Give an example of a monetary policy rule. Why might your rule be 
better than discretionary policy? Why might it be worse?
Should the Central Bank Aim for  
Zero Inflation?
One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1, and developed more 
fully in the chapter on money growth and inflation, is that prices rise when the 
government prints too much money. Another of the Ten Principles of Economics 
discussed in Chapter 1, and developed more fully in the preceding chapter, is 
that society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Put 
together, these two principles raise a question for policymakers: How much infla-
tion should the central bank be willing to tolerate? Our fourth debate is whether 
zero is the right target for the inflation rate.
FYI
 Inflation Targeting
O
ver the past few decades, many central banks around the world 
have adopted a policy called inflation targeting. Sometimes this 
takes the form of a central bank announcing its intentions regarding the 
inflation rate over the next few years. At other times it takes the form 
of a national law that specifies an inflation goal for the central bank. 
	
Inflation targeting is not a commitment to an ironclad rule. In all 
the countries that have adopted inflation targeting, central banks are 
left with a fair amount of discretion. Inflation targets are usually set as 
a range—an inflation rate of 1 to 3 percent, for example—rather than 
a particular number. Thus, the central bank can choose where in the 
range it wants to be. Moreover, the central bank is sometimes allowed 
to adjust its target for inflation, at least temporarily, if some event (such 
as a shock to world oil prices) pushes inflation outside the target range.
	
Although inflation targeting leaves the central bank with some 
discretion, the policy does constrain how that discretion is used. 
When a central bank is told simply to “do the right thing,” it is hard 
to hold the central bank accountable, because people can argue for-
ever about what the right thing is. By contrast, when a central bank 
has an inflation target, the public can more easily judge whether the 
central bank is meeting its goals. Inflation targeting does not tie the 
hands of the central bank, but it does increase the transparency and 
accountability of monetary policy. In a sense, inflation targeting is a 
compromise in the debate over rules versus discretion.
	
The Federal Reserve has not adopted an explicit policy of infla-
tion targeting (although some commentators have suggested that it 
has an implicit inflation target of about 2 percent). One prominent 
advocate of inflation targeting is Ben Bernanke, a former economics 
professor who became Fed Chairman in 2006. It is possible, there-
fore, that the Federal Reserve may move toward inflation targeting 
in the future.

Pro: The Central Bank Should Aim for  
Zero Inflation
Inflation confers no benefit on society, but it imposes several real costs. As we 
have discussed, economists have identified six costs of inflation:
• 	 Shoeleather costs associated with reduced money holdings 
• 	 Menu costs associated with more frequent adjustment of prices 
• 	 Increased variability of relative prices 
• 	 Unintended changes in tax liabilities due to nonindexation of the tax code 
• 	 Confusion and inconvenience resulting from a changing unit of account
• 	 Arbitrary redistributions of wealth associated with dollar-denominated debts 
Some economists argue that these costs are small, at least for moderate rates of infla-
tion, such as the 3 percent inflation experienced in the United States during the 1990s 
and 2000s. But other economists claim these costs can be substantial, even for moderate 
inflation. Moreover, there is no doubt that the public dislikes inflation. When inflation 
heats up, opinion polls identify inflation as one of the nation’s leading problems.
The benefits of zero inflation have to be weighed against the costs of achiev-
ing it. Reducing inflation usually requires a period of high unemployment and 
low output, as illustrated by the short-run Phillips curve. But this disinflationary 
recession is only temporary. Once people come to understand that policymakers 
are aiming for zero inflation, expectations of inflation will fall, and the short-run 
trade-off will improve. Because expectations adjust, there is no trade-off between 
inflation and unemployment in the long run. 
Reducing inflation is, therefore, a policy with temporary costs and permanent 
benefits. Once the disinflationary recession is over, the benefits of zero inflation 
would persist into the future. If policymakers are farsighted, they should be will-
ing to incur the temporary costs for the permanent benefits. This is precisely the 
calculation made by Paul Volcker in the early 1980s, when he tightened monetary 
policy and reduced inflation from about 10 percent in 1980 to about 4 percent in 
1983. Although in 1982 unemployment reached its highest level since the Great 
Depression, the economy eventually recovered from the recession, leaving a leg-
acy of low inflation. Today, Volcker is considered a hero among central bankers.
Moreover, the costs of reducing inflation need not be as large as some econo-
mists claim. If the Fed announces a credible commitment to zero inflation, it can 
directly influence expectations of inflation. Such a change in expectations can 
improve the short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment, allowing 
the economy to reach lower inflation at a reduced cost. The key to this strategy 
is credibility: People must believe that the Fed is actually going to carry through 
on its announced policy. Congress could help in this regard by passing legislation 
that makes price stability the Fed’s primary goal. Such a law would make it less 
costly to achieve zero inflation without reducing any of the resulting benefits.
One advantage of a zero-inflation target is that zero provides a more natural 
focal point for policymakers than any other number. Suppose, for instance, that 
the Fed were to announce that it would keep inflation at 3 percent—the rate 
experienced during much of the previous two decades. Would the Fed really 
stick to that 3 percent target? If events inadvertently pushed inflation up to 4 or 
5 percent, why wouldn’t it just raise the target? There is, after all, nothing special 
about the number 3. By contrast, zero is the only number for the inflation rate at 
which the Fed can claim that it achieved price stability and fully eliminated the 
costs of inflation.

Con: The Central Bank Should Not Aim for  
Zero Inflation
Price stability may be desirable, but the benefits of zero inflation compared to 
moderate inflation are small, whereas the costs of reaching zero inflation are large. 
Estimates of the sacrifice ratio suggest that reducing inflation by 1 percentage 
point requires giving up about 5 percent of one year’s output. Reducing inflation 
from, say, 4 percent to zero requires a loss of 20 percent of a year’s output. People 
might dislike inflation of 4 percent, but it is not at all clear that they would (or 
should) be willing to pay 20 percent of a year’s income to get rid of it.
The social costs of disinflation are even larger than this 20 percent figure suggests, 
for the lost income is not spread equitably over the population. When the economy 
goes into recession, all incomes do not fall proportionately. Instead, the fall in aggre-
gate income is concentrated on those workers who lose their jobs. The vulnerable 
workers are often those with the least skills and experience. Hence, much of the cost 
of reducing inflation is borne by those who can least afford to pay it. 
Economists can list several costs of inflation, but there is no professional con-
sensus that these costs are substantial. The shoeleather costs, menu costs, and 
others that economists have identified do not seem great, at least for moderate 
rates of inflation. It is true that the public dislikes inflation, but the public may be 
misled into believing the inflation fallacy—the view that inflation erodes living 
standards. Economists understand that living standards depend on productivity, 
not monetary policy. Because inflation in nominal incomes goes hand in hand 
with inflation in prices, reducing inflation would not cause real incomes to rise 
more rapidly. 
Moreover, policymakers can reduce many of the costs of inflation without 
actually reducing inflation. They can eliminate the problems associated with the 
nonindexed tax system by rewriting the tax laws to take account of the effects of 
inflation. They can also reduce the arbitrary redistributions of wealth between 
creditors and debtors caused by unexpected inflation by issuing indexed govern-
ment bonds, as in fact the Clinton administration did in 1997. Such an act insulates 
holders of government debt from inflation. In addition, by setting an example, 
the policy might encourage private borrowers and lenders to write debt contracts 
indexed for inflation.
Reducing inflation might be desirable if it could be done at no cost, as some 
economists argue is possible. Yet this trick seems hard to carry out in practice. 
When economies reduce their rate of inflation, they almost always experience a 
period of high unemployment and low output. It is risky to believe that the central 
bank could achieve credibility so quickly as to make disinflation painless.
Indeed, a disinflationary recession can potentially leave permanent scars on the 
economy. Firms in all industries reduce their spending on new plants and equipment 
substantially during recessions, making investment the most volatile component of 
GDP. Even after the recession is over, the smaller stock of capital reduces produc-
tivity, incomes, and living standards below the levels they otherwise would have 
achieved. In addition, when workers become unemployed in recessions, they lose 
valuable job skills, permanently reducing their value as workers. 
A little bit of inflation may even be a good thing. Some economists believe that 
inflation “greases the wheels” of the labor market. Because workers resist cuts in 
nominal wages, a fall in real wages is more easily accomplished with a rising price 
level. Inflation thus makes it easier for real wages to adjust to changes in labor 
market conditions.

 What Is the Optimal Inflation Rate?
In the aftermath of the financial crisis and recession of 2008–2009, 
economists started wondering whether higher inflation might be 
desirable.

Low-Inflation Doctrine 
Gets a Rethink, But 
Shift Is Unlikely 
By Jon Hilsenrath
F
or the past quarter century, inflation has 
been a bogeyman that eats wealth and 
causes instability. But lately some smart 
people—including the chief economist at 
the International Monetary Fund and a 
senior Federal Reserve researcher—have 
been wondering aloud if a little more of it 
might actually be a good thing. 
	
For several reasons, however, the idea 
isn’t likely to gain traction any time soon. 
	
The new argument for inflation goes like 
this: Low inflation and the low interest rates 
that accompany it leave central banks little room 
to maneuver when shocks hit. After Lehman 
Brothers collapsed in 2008, for example, the U.S. 
Federal Reserve quickly cut interest rates to near 
zero, but couldn’t go any lower even though the 
economy needed a lot more stimulus.
	
Economists call this the “zero bound” 
problem. If inflation were a little higher to 
begin with, and thus interest rates were a lit-
tle higher, the argument goes, the Fed would 
have had more room to cut interest rates and 
provided more juice to the economy. 
	
Right now, the Fed and other big central 
banks have their sights set on inflation of 
around 2%. Economists had used a “Three 
Bears” approach to come up with this 
number—for a long time it seemed like it 
was not too hot and not too cold. But low 
and stable inflation could in theory mean 
something steady at a slightly higher rate. 
	
IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard, in 
a recent paper, said maybe the U.S. central 
bank’s future inflation goal should be 4% 
instead. John Williams, head of the San 
Francisco Fed’s research department, argued 
last year that higher targets might be needed 
to provide a cushion for future crises. . . . 
	
There are other reasons some would 
welcome a little more inflation now. 
Governments in the U.S. and elsewhere, and 
many U.S. households, are sitting on moun-
tains of debt. A little more inflation could in 
theory reduce the burden of servicing and 
paying that off, because while debt payments 
are often fixed, the revenue and income that 
households and governments generate to 
pay it off would rise with inflation. 
	
But there are problems with the welcome-
more-inflation argument. 
	
The first is that it isn’t yet clear that the 
“zero bound” on interest rates that Mr. 
Blanchard worries about is the economy’s 
biggest problem. Thus addressing it might 
not be worth the costs that would be associ-
ated with higher inflation. 
	
After the Fed pushed interest rates to 
near zero in December 2008, Chairman Ben 
Bernanke found alternatives to more interest-
rate cuts: buying mortgage-backed securities 
and Treasury bonds and funneling credit to 
auto-loan, student-loan and credit-card mar-
kets. Those additional steps were no pana-
cea, but they helped end the recession even 
if they didn’t produce growth fast enough to 
bring unemployment down quickly. . . . 
	
There is also a thornier problem. Suppose 
for a moment that Mr. Blanchard is right, 
and central banks around the world would 
be better prepared to fight future crises with 
a little higher inflation. Getting from 2% to 
4% could be a very messy process. Investors, 
businesses and households might well con-
clude a one-time shift to a higher inflation 
target actually means less commitment to 
stable inflation. Expectations of higher infla-
tion could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
Instead of getting 4% inflation, central banks 
could end up with 5%, or 6% or 7%.
	
A higher inflation goal “would have a 
fairly immediate and disruptive effect” on 
markets, said Bruce Kasman, chief econo-
mist at J.P. Morgan Chase.
	
Mr. Bernanke has acknowledged the 
allure of a higher inflation goal. In written 
answers to lawmakers in December, he 
said a higher inflation target could in theory 
make it possible for the Fed to push infla-
tion-adjusted interest rates lower, stimulat-
ing borrowing and economic growth. 
	
But the opposite could happen, too. 
The prospect of higher inflation could cause 
interest rates to shoot up and make the bur-
den of future borrowing even heavier. This 
is a particular problem for countries, like the 
U.S., that issue a lot of short-term debt and 
for people with adjustable-rate mortgages. 
	
Mr. Bernanke concluded he didn’t want to 
mess with people’s fragile expectations. He said 
switching to a higher target would risk causing 
“the public to lose confidence in the central 
bank’s willingness to resist further upward shifts 
in inflation, and so undermine the effectiveness 
of monetary policy going forward.”
	
The 2% inflation goal that is so popular 
with central bankers around the world might 
not have been the ideal target in retrospect. 
But it looks like everybody is tied to it, for 
better or worse, for the foreseeable future.

In addition, inflation allows for the possibility of negative real interest rates. 
Nominal interest rates can never fall below zero, because lenders can always hold 
on to their money rather than lending it out at a negative return. If inflation is 
zero, real interest rates can never be negative as well. However, if inflation is posi-
tive, then a cut in nominal interest rates below the inflation rate produces negative 
real interest rates. Sometimes the economy may need negative real interest rates 
to provide sufficient stimulus to aggregate demand—an option ruled out by zero 
inflation.
In light of all these arguments, why should policymakers put the economy 
through a costly, inequitable disinflationary recession to achieve zero inflation? 
Economist Alan Blinder, who was once vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, 
argued in his book Hard Heads, Soft Hearts that policymakers should not make 
this choice:
The costs that attend the low and moderate inflation rates experienced in the 
United States and in other industrial countries appear to be quite modest—
more like a bad cold than a cancer on society. . . . As rational individuals, we 
do not volunteer for a lobotomy to cure a head cold. Yet, as a collectivity, we 
routinely prescribe the economic equivalent of lobotomy (high unemployment) 
as a cure for the inflationary cold.
Blinder concludes that it is better to learn to live with moderate inflation.
QUICK QUIZ  Explain the costs and benefits of reducing inflation to zero. Which are

Should the Government Balance Its Budget?
A persistent macroeconomic debate concerns the government’s finances. When-
ever the government spends more than it collects in tax revenue, it covers this 
budget deficit by issuing government debt. In our study of financial markets, 
we saw how budget deficits affect saving, investment, and interest rates. But 
how big a problem are budget deficits? Our fifth debate concerns whether fiscal 
policymakers should make balancing the government’s budget a high priority.
Pro: The Government Should Balance Its Budget
The U.S. federal government is far more indebted today than it was two decades 
ago. In 1980, the federal debt was $710 billion; in 2009, it was $7.6 trillion. If we 
divide today’s debt by the size of the population, we learn that each person’s 
share of the government debt is about $25,000.
The most direct effect of the government debt is to place a burden on future 
generations of taxpayers. When these debts and accumulated interest come due, 
future taxpayers will face a difficult choice. They can choose some combination of 
higher taxes and less government spending to make resources available to pay off 
the debt and accumulated interest. Or, instead, they can delay the day of reckon-
ing and put the government into even deeper debt by borrowing once again to 
pay off the old debt and interest. In essence, when the government runs a budget 
deficit and issues government debt, it allows current taxpayers to pass the bill for 
some of their government spending on to future taxpayers. Inheriting such a large 
debt cannot help but lower the living standard of future generations.

## Page 824

In addition to this direct effect, budget deficits have various macroeconomic 
effects. Because budget deficits represent negative public saving, they lower 
national saving (the sum of private and public saving). Reduced national sav-
ing causes real interest rates to rise and investment to fall. Reduced investment 
leads over time to a smaller stock of capital. A lower capital stock reduces labor 
productivity, real wages, and the economy’s production of goods and services. 
Thus, when the government increases its debt, future generations are born into an 
economy with lower incomes as well as higher taxes.
There are, nevertheless, situations in which running a budget deficit is justifi-
able. Throughout history, the most common cause of increased government debt 
has been war. When a military conflict raises government spending temporarily, 
it is reasonable to finance this extra spending by borrowing. Otherwise, taxes dur-
ing wartime would have to rise precipitously. Such high tax rates would greatly 
distort the incentives faced by those who are taxed, leading to large deadweight 
losses. In addition, such high tax rates would be unfair to current generations of 
taxpayers, who already have to make the sacrifice of fighting the war. 
Similarly, it is reasonable to allow a budget deficit during a temporary downturn 
in economic activity. When the economy goes into a recession, tax revenue falls 
automatically because the income tax and the payroll tax are levied on measures of 
income. If the government tried to balance its budget during a recession, it would 
have to raise taxes or cut spending at a time of high unemployment. Such a policy 
would tend to depress aggregate demand at precisely the time it needed to be stimu-
lated and, therefore, would tend to increase the magnitude of economic fluctuations.
Yet not all budget deficits can be justified by appealing to war or recession. U.S. 
government debt as a percentage of GDP increased from 26 percent in 1980 to 50 
percent in 1995. During this period, the United States experienced neither a major 
military conflict nor a major economic downturn. Yet the government consistently 
ran a sizable budget deficit, largely because the president and Congress found it 
easier to increase government spending than to increase taxes. 
The budget deficits of the first decade of the 2000s can, perhaps, be rationalized 
by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the effects of the recessions in 2001 and 
2008–2009. But it is imperative that this deficit not signal a return to the unsustain-
able fiscal policy of an earlier era. As the economy recovers from the most recent 
recession and unemployment returns to its natural rate, the government should 
bring spending in line with tax revenue. Compared to the alternative of ongoing 
budget deficits, a balanced budget means greater national saving, investment, 
and economic growth. It means that future college graduates will enter a more 
prosperous economy.
Con: The Government Should Not Balance Its Budget
The problem of government debt is often exaggerated. Although the government 
debt does represent a tax burden on younger generations, it is not large compared 
to the average person’s lifetime income. The debt of the U.S. federal government 
is about $25,000 per person. A person who works 40 years for $50,000 a year will 
earn $2 million over his lifetime. His share of the government debt represents 
about 1 percent of his lifetime resources. 
Moreover, it is misleading to view the effects of budget deficits in isolation. The 
budget deficit is just one piece of a large picture of how the government chooses to 
raise and spend money. In making these decisions over fiscal policy, policymakers 
affect different generations of taxpayers in many ways. The government’s budget 
deficit or surplus should be considered together with these other policies.
“What?!? My share of the  
government debt is $25,000?”

For example, suppose the government reduces the budget deficit by cutting spend-
ing on public investments, such as education. Does this policy make younger genera-
tions better off? The government debt will be smaller when they enter the labor force, 
which means a smaller tax burden. Yet if they are less educated than they could be, 
their productivity and incomes will be lower. Many estimates of the return to school-
ing (the increase in a worker’s wage that results from an additional year in school) find 
that it is quite large. Reducing the budget deficit rather than funding more education 
spending could, all things considered, make future generations worse off.
Single-minded concern about the budget deficit is also dangerous because it 
draws attention away from various other policies that redistribute income across 
generations. For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. federal government raised 
Social Security benefits for the elderly. It financed this higher spending by increas-
ing the payroll tax on the working-age population. This policy redistributed income 
away from younger generations toward older generations, even though it did not 
affect the government debt. Thus, the budget deficit is only a small part of the larger 
issue of how government policy affects the welfare of different generations.
To some extent, forward-looking parents can reverse the adverse effects of gov-
ernment debt. The parent can offset the impact simply by saving and leaving a 
larger bequest. The bequest would enhance the children’s ability to bear the burden 
of future taxes. Some economists claim that people do in fact behave this way. If 
this were true, higher private saving by parents would offset the public dissaving of 
budget deficits, and deficits would not affect the economy. Most economists doubt 
that parents are so farsighted, but some people probably do act this way, and any-
one could. Deficits give people the opportunity to consume at the expense of their 
children, but deficits do not require them to do so. If the government debt were actu-
ally a great problem facing future generations, some parents would help to solve it.
Critics of budget deficits sometimes assert that the government debt cannot con-
tinue to rise forever, but in fact, it can. Just as a bank evaluating a loan application 
would compare a person’s debts to his income, we should judge the burden of the 
government debt relative to the size of the nation’s income. Population growth and 
technological progress cause the total income of the U.S. economy to grow over time. 
As a result, the nation’s ability to pay the interest on the government debt grows over 
time as well. As long as the government debt grows more slowly than the nation’s 
income, there is nothing to prevent the government debt from growing forever.
Some numbers can put this into perspective. The real output of the U.S. economy 
grows on average about 3 percent per year. If the inflation rate is 2 percent per year, then 
nominal income grows at a rate of 5 percent per year. The government debt, therefore, 
can rise by 5 percent per year without increasing the ratio of debt to income. In 2009, 
the federal government debt was $7.6 trillion; 5 percent of this figure is $380 billion. As 
long as the federal budget deficit is smaller than $380 billion, the policy is sustainable. 
To be sure, very large budget deficits cannot persist forever. In 2010, the federal 
budget deficit was about $1.5 trillion, but this astonishing number was driven by 
extraordinary circumstances: a major financial crisis, a deep economic downturn, 
and the policy responses to these events. No one suggests that a deficit of this 
magnitude can continue. But zero is the wrong target for fiscal policymakers. As 
long as the deficit is only moderate in size, there will never be a day of reckoning 
that forces the budget deficits to end or the economy to collapse.
QUICK QUIZ  Explain how reducing a government budget deficit makes future 
generations better off. What fiscal policy might improve the lives of future generations

The Californization of 
Washington 
By David Wessel
C
alifornia’s economy is large, rich and 
vibrant. It accounts for more than $1 
of every $7 of goods and services pro-
duced in the U.S. and is bigger than all 
but seven countries. California has less 
taxpayer-backed state debt per person than 
Massachusetts and less as a percentage of 
its economy than New York, according to 
rating agency Standard & Poor’s.
	
By such measures, California, though 
hit hard by the recession and housing bust, 
would seem an unlikely candidate for a 
government that might not pay its debts. 
But it is, the result of a dysfunctional political 
system that combines well-financed referen-
dums, super-majorities in the legislature and 
politicians unable to grapple with funda-
mental issues. Talk, now fading, is that only 
a constitutional convention can fix things.
	
The future, it’s often said, arrives in 
California first. Is Washington next?. . .
	
Today’s big budget deficit is not the prob-
lem. It is swollen by following the textbook 
prescription in a deep recession in which the 
Federal Reserve has cut interest rates to zero. 
The government-borrowing surge has been 
matched by a decline in private borrowing.
	
But this won’t last. The recent past is 
reassuring, falsely so. Over the past 40 years, 
the U.S. government has expanded benefits 
and avoided massive tax increases by cutting 
defense spending and borrowing heavily with 
ease. That is no longer feasible. When defi-
cits grew uncomfortably large, congressional 
and White House deal makers emerged to 
alter course. They always muddle through, 
the markets and the public concluded.
	
Today, the deficits projected are bigger 
than ever, baby boomers are beginning to 
retire, health-care costs keep rising and, surely, 
we’re closer to the day when Asian govern-
ments grow reluctant to lend ever-greater 
sums to the U.S. Treasury at low interest rates.
	
The Congressional Budget Office pro­
jects current policies would take the deficit 
from today’s 10% of gross domestic product 
to over 20% by 2020 and over 40% by 
2080. Yet today’s politics appear more 
toxic, and the ranks of congressional leaders

Should the Tax Laws Be Reformed to  
Encourage Saving?
A nation’s standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and ser-
vices. This was one of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1. As we saw in 
the chapter on production and growth, a nation’s productive capability, in turn, 
is determined largely by how much it saves and invests for the future. Our sixth 
debate is whether policymakers should reform the tax laws to encourage greater 
saving and investment. 
Pro: The Tax Laws Should Be Reformed to  
Encourage Saving
A nation’s saving rate is a key determinant of its long-run economic prosper-
ity. When the saving rate is higher, more resources are available for investment 
in new plant and equipment. A larger stock of plant and equipment, in turn, 
raises labor productivity, wages, and incomes. It is, therefore, no surprise that

international data show a strong correlation between national saving rates and 
measures of economic well-being.
Another of the Ten Principles of Economics presented in Chapter 1 is that people 
respond to incentives. This lesson should apply to people’s decisions about how 
much to save. If a nation’s laws make saving attractive, people will save a higher frac-
tion of their incomes, and this higher saving will lead to a more prosperous future.
Unfortunately, the U.S. tax system discourages saving by taxing the return to sav-
ing quite heavily. For example, consider a 25-year-old worker who saves $1,000 of her 
income to have a more comfortable retirement at the age of 70. If she buys a bond that 
pays an interest rate of 10 percent, the $1,000 will accumulate at the end of 45 years to 
$72,900 in the absence of taxes on interest. But suppose she faces a marginal tax rate 
on interest income of 40 percent, which is typical of many workers once federal and 
state income taxes are added together. In this case, her after-tax interest rate is only 6 
percent, and the $1,000 will accumulate at the end of 45 years to only $13,800. That is, 
accumulated over this long span of time, the tax rate on interest income reduces the 
benefit of saving $1,000 from $72,900 to $13,800—or by about 80 percent.
The tax code further discourages saving by taxing some forms of capital income 
twice. Suppose a person uses some of his saving to buy stock in a corporation. 
with the skill and desire to fashion compro-
mises instead of talking points are depleted.
	
So what happens? One possibility is a 
political miracle: A sudden attack of leadership 
or bipartisanship, perhaps the rise of another 
Ross Perot to galvanize public angst about 
deficits. Another is a plunge in the U.S. dollar 
or spike in bond-market interest rates that 
spurs government belt-tightening, perhaps 
forcing spending cuts and tax increases before 
the economy is strong enough to take them.
	
It could be worse. “A far worse situation 
would be for interest rates to stay low while we 
accumulated unprecedented amounts of debt 
only to respond very suddenly when financial 
markets or foreign lenders decide that the U.S. 
is not a good credit risk,” Leonard Burman of 
Syracuse University and economists from the 
Urban Institute told a recent conference at the 
University of Southern California. “That could 
produce a catastrophic financial meltdown, 
similar to the one triggered by the bursting of 
the housing market boom, but with one impor-
tant difference. . . . The [U.S.] government will 
not be able to borrow to deal with its effects.”
	
Imagine this plausible scenario: Public con-
fidence in government continues to decline. 
Unemployment remains high. Americans 
demand more government services, more 
benefits and lower taxes. Politicians, seeking 
re-election, go along. . . .
	
In this scenario, even deficit-fearing 
politicians avoid taking on the long-term 
deficit. Mr. Burman imagines a White House 
political adviser saying: “Mr. President, if 
you raise taxes or cut popular programs, 
you or your party will be defeated in the 
polls and the bad guys will take over. 
The bad guys do not share your priorities 
and they do not care about the deficit. 
Therefore, you cannot effectively deal with 
the deficit.”
	
The challenge isn’t coming up with options. 
The CBO has a book full of them, ranging from 
raising the retirement age to taxing carbon. It’s 
arithmetically possible to eliminate the deficit 
exclusively by cutting spending. Wisconsin 
Republican Rep. Paul Ryan’s Roadmap does. 
But there’s no political majority for those pro-
posals. It’s arithmetically possible to eliminate 
the deficit by raising taxes, but the resulting 
tax rates would be politically and economically 
devastating. The challenge is fashioning a 
compromise that both solves the problem and 
is politically viable.
	
In August 1982, President Ronald Reagan 
went on TV to defend a package of spending 
cuts and tax increases that undid some of his 
earlier tax cuts: “Do we tell . . . Americans 
to give up hope, that their ship of state lies 
dead in the water because those entrusted 
with manning that ship can’t agree on which 
sail to raise? We’re within sight of the safe 
port of economic recovery. Do we make port 
or go aground on the shoals of selfishness, 
partisanship, and just plain bullheadedness?”
	
Good question.

When the corporation earns a profit from its capital investments, it first pays tax 
on this profit in the form of the corporate income tax. If the corporation pays out 
the rest of the profit to the stockholder in the form of dividends, the stockholder 
pays tax on this income a second time in the form of the individual income tax. 
This double taxation substantially reduces the return to the stockholder, thereby 
reducing the incentive to save.
The tax laws again discourage saving if a person wants to leave his accumu-
lated wealth to his children (or anyone else) rather than consuming it during 
his lifetime. Parents can bequeath some money to their children tax-free, but 
if the bequest becomes large, the inheritance tax rate can be as high as 55 per-
cent. To a large extent, concern about national saving is motivated by a desire 
to ensure economic prosperity for future generations. It is odd, therefore, that 
the tax laws discourage the most direct way in which one generation can help 
the next. 
In addition to the tax code, many other policies and institutions in our society 
reduce the incentive for households to save. Some government benefits, such as 
welfare and Medicaid, are means-tested; that is, the benefits are reduced for those 
who in the past have been prudent enough to save some of their income. Colleges 
and universities grant financial aid as a function of the wealth of the students 
and their parents. Such a policy is like a tax on wealth and, as such, discourages 
students and parents from saving.
There are various ways in which the tax code could provide an incentive to 
save, or at least reduce the disincentive that households now face. Already the 
tax laws give preferential treatment to some types of retirement saving. When a 
taxpayer puts income into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), for instance, 
that income and the interest it earns are not taxed until the funds are withdrawn at 
retirement. The tax code gives a similar tax advantage to retirement accounts that 
go by other names, such as 401(k), 403(b), Keogh plan, and profit-sharing plans. 
There are, however, limits to who is eligible to use these plans and, for those who 
are eligible, limits on the amount that can be put in them. Moreover, because there 
are penalties for withdrawal before retirement age, these retirement plans provide 
little incentive for other types of saving, such as saving to buy a house or pay for 
college. A small step to encourage greater saving would be to expand the ability 
of households to use such tax-advantaged savings accounts.
A more comprehensive approach would be to reconsider the entire basis by 
which the government collects revenue. The centerpiece of the U.S. tax system is 
the income tax. A dollar earned is taxed the same whether it is spent or saved. 
An alternative advocated by many economists is a consumption tax. Under a con-
sumption tax, a household pays taxes only on the basis of what it spends. Income 
that is saved is exempt from taxation until the saving is later withdrawn and 
spent on consumption goods. In essence, a consumption tax puts all saving auto-
matically into a tax-advantaged savings account, much like an IRA. A switch from 
income to consumption taxation would greatly increase the incentive to save.
Con: The Tax Laws Should Not Be Reformed to 
Encourage Saving
Increasing saving may be desirable, but it is not the only goal of tax policy. Policy­
makers also must be sure to distribute the tax burden fairly. The problem with 
proposals to increase the incentive to save is that they increase the tax burden on 
those who can least afford it.

It is undeniable that high-income households save a greater fraction of their 
income than low-income households. As a result, any tax change that favors 
people who save will also tend to favor people with high income. Policies such 
as tax-advantaged retirement accounts may seem appealing, but they lead to a 
less egalitarian society. By reducing the tax burden on the wealthy who can take 
advantage of these accounts, they force the government to raise the tax burden 
on the poor. 
Moreover, tax policies designed to encourage saving may not be effective 
at achieving that goal. Economic theory does not give a clear prediction about 
whether a higher rate of return would increase saving. The outcome depends 
on the relative size of two conflicting forces, called the substitution effect and the 
income effect. On the one hand, a higher rate of return raises the benefit of saving: 
Each dollar saved today produces more consumption in the future. This substi-
tution effect tends to increase saving. On the other hand, a higher rate of return 
lowers the need for saving: A household has to save less to achieve any target level 
of consumption in the future. This income effect tends to reduce saving. If the 
substitution and income effects approximately cancel each other, as some studies 
suggest, then saving will not change when lower taxation of capital income raises 
the rate of return.
There are ways to increase national saving other than by giving tax breaks to 
the rich. National saving is the sum of private and public saving. Instead of trying 
to alter the tax code to encourage greater private saving, policymakers can simply 
raise public saving by reducing the budget deficit, perhaps by raising taxes on the 
wealthy. This offers a direct way of raising national saving and increasing pros-
perity for future generations.
Indeed, once public saving is taken into account, tax provisions to encourage 
saving might backfire. Tax changes that reduce the taxation of capital income 
reduce government revenue and, thereby, lead to a larger budget deficit. To 
increase national saving, such a change in the tax code must stimulate private 
saving by more than the decline in public saving. If this is not the case, so-called 
saving incentives can potentially make matters worse.
QUICK QUIZ  Give three examples of how our society discourages saving. What are 
the drawbacks of eliminating these disincentives?
Conclusion
This chapter has considered six classic debates over macroeconomic policy. For 
each, it began with a controversial proposition and then offered the arguments 
pro and con. If you find it hard to choose a side in these debates, you may find 
some comfort in the fact that you are not alone. The study of economics does not 
always make it easy to choose among alternative policies. Indeed, by clarifying 
the inevitable trade-offs that policymakers face, it can make the choice more 
difficult. 
Difficult choices, however, have no right to seem easy. When you hear politi-
cians or commentators proposing something that sounds too good to be true, it 
probably is. If they sound like they are offering you a free lunch, you should look 
for the hidden price tag. Few if any policies come with benefits but no costs. By 
helping you see through the fog of rhetoric so common in political discourse, the 
study of economics should make you a better participant in our national debates.

Questions for Review
Summary
• Advocates of active monetary and fiscal pol-
icy view the economy as inherently unstable 
and believe that policy can manage aggregate 
demand to offset the inherent instability. Critics 
of active monetary and fiscal policy emphasize 
that policy affects the economy with a lag and 
that our ability to forecast future economic con-
ditions is poor. As a result, attempts to stabilize 
the economy can end up being destabilizing.
• Advocates of increased government spending to 
fight recessions argue that because tax cuts may be 
saved rather than spent, direct government spend-
ing does more to increase aggregate demand, 
which is key to promoting production and employ-
ment. Critics of spending hikes argue that tax cuts 
can expand both aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply and that hasty increases in government 
spending may lead to wasteful public projects. 
• Advocates of rules for monetary policy argue 
that discretionary policy can suffer from incom-
petence, the abuse of power, and time inconsis-
tency. Critics of rules for monetary policy argue 
that discretionary policy is more flexible in 
responding to changing economic circumstances.
• Advocates of a zero-inflation target emphasize 
that inflation has many costs and few if any bene-
fits. Moreover, the cost of eliminating ­inflation—
depressed output and employment—is only 
temporary. Even this cost can be reduced if the 
central bank announces a credible plan to reduce 
inflation, thereby directly lowering expectations 
of inflation. Critics of a zero-inflation target claim 
that moderate inflation imposes only small costs 
on society, whereas the recession necessary to 
reduce inflation is quite costly. The critics also 
point out several ways in which moderate infla-
tion may be helpful to an economy.
• Advocates of a balanced government budget 
argue that budget deficits impose an unjustifi-
able burden on future generations by raising 
their taxes and lowering their incomes. Critics 
of a balanced government budget argue that the 
deficit is only one small piece of fiscal policy. 
Single-minded concern about the budget deficit 
can obscure the many ways in which policy, 
including various spending programs, affects 
different generations.
• Advocates of tax incentives for saving point out 
that our society discourages saving in many ways, 
such as by heavily taxing capital income and by 
reducing benefits for those who have accumu-
lated wealth. They endorse reforming the tax laws 
to encourage saving, perhaps by switching from 
an income tax to a consumption tax. Critics of tax 
incentives for saving argue that many proposed 
changes to stimulate saving would primarily 
benefit the wealthy, who do not need a tax break. 
They also argue that such changes might have 
only a small effect on private saving. Raising pub-
lic saving by decreasing the government’s budget 
deficit would provide a more direct and equitable 
way to increase national saving.

Problems and Applications
	 8.	 Give an example of how the government might 
hurt young generations, even while reducing 
the government debt they inherit.
	 9.	 Some economists say that the government can 
continue running a budget deficit forever. How 
is that possible?
	10.	 Some income from capital is taxed twice. Explain.
	11.	 Give an example, other than tax policy, of how 
our society discourages saving.
	12.	 What adverse effect might be caused by tax 
incentives to raise saving?
	 1.	 The chapter suggests that the economy, like the 
human body, has “natural restorative powers.”
a.	 Illustrate the short-run effect of a fall in aggre-
gate demand using an aggregate-demand/
aggregate-supply diagram. What happens to 
total output, income, and employment?
b.	If the government does not use stabilization 
policy, what happens to the economy over 
time? Illustrate this adjustment on your dia-
gram. Does it generally occur in a matter of 
months or a matter of years?
c.	 Do you think the “natural restorative powers” 
of the economy mean that policymakers should 
be passive in response to the business cycle?
	 2.	 Policymakers who want to stabilize the  
economy must decide how much to change the 
money supply, government spending, or taxes. 
Why is it difficult for policymakers to choose 
the appropriate strength of their actions?
	 3.	 The problem of time inconsistency applies 
to fiscal policy as well as to monetary policy. 
Suppose the government announced a  
reduction in taxes on income from capital 
investments, like new factories.
a.	 If investors believed that capital taxes would 
remain low, how would the government’s 
action affect the level of investment?
b.	After investors have responded to the 
announced tax reduction, does the govern-
ment have an incentive to renege on its  
policy? Explain.
c.	 Given your answer to part (b), would  
investors believe the government’s  
announcement? What can the government 
do to increase the credibility of announced 
policy changes?
d.	Explain why this situation is similar to the 
time inconsistency problem faced by  
monetary policymakers.
	 4.	 Chapter 2 explains the difference between  
positive analysis and normative analysis. In the 
debate about whether the central bank should 
aim for zero inflation, which areas of  
disagreement involve positive statements and 
which involve normative judgments?
	 5.	 Why are the benefits of reducing inflation  
permanent and the costs temporary? Why are 
the costs of increasing inflation permanent and 
the benefits temporary? Use Phillips-curve  
diagrams in your answer. 
	 6.	 Suppose the federal government cuts taxes and 
increases spending, raising the budget deficit to 
12 percent of GDP. If nominal GDP is rising  
5 percent per year, are such budget deficits  
sustainable forever? Explain. If budget deficits of 
this size are maintained for twenty years, what 
is likely to happen to your taxes and your chil-
dren’s taxes in the future? Can you personally 
do something today to offset this future effect?
	 7.	 Explain how each of the following policies 
redistributes income across generations. Is the 
redistribution from young to old or from old to 
young?
a.	 An increase in the budget deficit
b.	More generous subsidies for education loans
c.	 Greater investments in highways and bridges
d.	An increase in Social Security benefits
	 8.	 The chapter says that budget deficits reduce the 
income of future generations but can boost out-
put and income during a recession. Explain how 
both of these statements can be true.
	 9.	 What is the fundamental trade-off that society 
faces if it chooses to save more? How might the 
government increase national saving?
	10.	 Suppose the government reduced the tax rate 
on income from savings and raised taxes on 
labor income to avoid increasing the budget 
deficit.
