ou walk into a bookstore to buy a book to read during your next vaca-
tion. On the store’s shelves you find a Sue Grafton mystery, a Stephen 
King thriller, a David McCullough history, a Stephenie Meyer vampire 
romance, and many other choices. When you pick out a book and buy it, 
what kind of market are you participating in?
On the one hand, the market for books seems competitive. As you look over 
the shelves at your bookstore, you find many authors and many publishers vying 
for your attention. A buyer in this market has thousands of competing products 
from which to choose. And because anyone can enter the industry by writing and 
publishing a book, the book business is not very profitable. For every highly paid 
novelist, there are hundreds of struggling ones.
On the other hand, the market for books seems monopolistic. Because each 
book is unique, publishers have some latitude in choosing what price to charge. 
The sellers in this market are price makers rather than price takers. And indeed,

the price of books greatly exceeds marginal cost. The price of a typical hardcover 
novel, for instance, is about $25, whereas the cost of printing one additional copy 
of the novel is less than $5.
The market for novels fits neither the competitive nor the monopoly model. 
Instead, it is best described by the model of monopolistic competition, the subject 
of this chapter. The term “monopolistic competition” might at first seem to be an 
oxymoron, like “jumbo shrimp.” But as we will see, monopolistically competitive 
industries are monopolistic in some ways and competitive in others. The model 
describes not only the publishing industry but also the market for many other 
goods and services.
Between Monopoly and Perfect Competition
The previous two chapters analyzed markets with many competitive firms and 
markets with a single monopoly firm. In Chapter 14, we saw that the price in a 
perfectly competitive market always equals the marginal cost of production. We 
also saw that, in the long run, entry and exit drive economic profit to zero, so the 
price also equals average total cost. In Chapter 15, we saw how monopoly firms 
can use their market power to keep prices above marginal cost, leading to a posi-
tive economic profit for the firm and a deadweight loss for society. Competition 
and monopoly are extreme forms of market structure. Competition occurs when 
there are many firms in a market offering essentially identical products; monop-
oly occurs when there is only one firm in a market.
Although the cases of perfect competition and monopoly illustrate some impor-
tant ideas about how markets work, most markets in the economy include ele-
ments of both these cases and, therefore, are not completely described by either of 
them. The typical firm in the economy faces competition, but the competition is not 
so rigorous as to make the firm a price taker like the firms analyzed in Chapter 14. 
The typical firm also has some degree of market power, but its market power is not 
so great that the firm can be described exactly by the monopoly model presented 
in Chapter 15. In other words, many industries fall somewhere between the polar 
cases of perfect competition and monopoly. Economists call this situation imperfect 
competition.
One type of imperfectly competitive market is an oligopoly, which is a market 
with only a few sellers, each offering a product that is similar or identical to the 
products offered by other sellers. Economists measure a market’s domination by 
a small number of firms with a statistic called the concentration ratio, which is the 
percentage of total output in the market supplied by the four largest firms. In the 
U.S. economy, most industries have a four-firm concentration ratio under 50 per-
cent, but in some industries, the biggest firms play a more dominant role. Highly 
concentrated industries include breakfast cereal (which has a concentration ratio 
of 78 percent), aircraft manufacturing (81 percent), electric lamp bulbs (89 per-
cent), household laundry equipment (93 percent), and cigarettes (95 percent). 
These industries are best described as oligopolies.
A second type of imperfectly competitive market is called monopolistic 
­competition. This describes a market structure in which there are many firms 
selling products that are similar but not identical. In a monopolistically competi-
tive market, each firm has a monopoly over the product it makes, but many other 
firms make similar products that compete for the same customers.

CHAPTER 16    Monopolistic Competition
To be more precise, monopolistic competition describes a market with the fol-
lowing attributes:
• 	 Many sellers: There are many firms competing for the same group of customers.
• 	 Product differentiation: Each firm produces a product that is at least slightly 
different from those of other firms. Thus, rather than being a price taker, 
each firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve.
• 	 Free entry and exit: Firms can enter or exit the market without restriction. 
Thus, the number of firms in the market adjusts until economic profits are 
driven to zero.
A moment’s thought reveals a long list of markets with these attributes: books, 
DVDs, computer games, restaurants, piano lessons, cookies, clothing, and so on.
Monopolistic competition, like oligopoly, is a market structure that lies between 
the extreme cases of competition and monopoly. But oligopoly and monopolistic 
competition are quite different. Oligopoly departs from the perfectly competitive 
ideal of Chapter 14 because there are only a few sellers in the market. The small 
number of sellers makes rigorous competition less likely and strategic interactions 
among them vitally important. By contrast, under monopolistic competition, there 
are many sellers, each of which is small compared to the market. A monopolis­
tically competitive market departs from the perfectly competitive ideal because 
each of the sellers offers a somewhat different product.
Figure 1 summarizes the four types of market structure. The first question to 
ask about any market is how many firms there are. If there is only one firm, the 
market is a monopoly. If there are only a few firms, the market is an oligopoly. If 
there are many firms, we need to ask another question: Do the firms sell identi-
cal or differentiated products? If the many firms sell differentiated products, the 
market is monopolistically competitive. If the many firms sell identical products, 
the market is perfectly competitive.
The Four Types of 
Market Structure 
Economists who study industrial 
organization divide markets into 
four types—monopoly, oligopoly, 
monopolistic competition, and 
perfect competition.

Because reality is never as clear-cut as theory, at times you may find it hard 
to decide what structure best describes a market. There is, for instance, no magic 
number that separates “few” from “many” when counting the number of firms. 
(Do the approximately dozen companies that now sell cars in the United States 
make this market an oligopoly or more competitive? The answer is open to 
debate.) Similarly, there is no sure way to determine when products are differe­n­
tiated and when they are identical. (Are different brands of milk really the same? 
Again, the answer is debatable.) When analyzing actual markets, economists have 
to keep in mind the lessons learned from studying all types of market structure 
and then apply each lesson as it seems appropriate.
Now that we understand how economists define the various types of market 
structure, we can continue our analysis of each of them. In the next chapter we 
analyze oligopoly. In this chapter we examine monopolistic competition.
Quick Quiz  Define oligopoly and monopolistic competition and give an example 
of each.
Competition with Differentiated Products
To understand monopolistically competitive markets, we first consider the deci-
sions facing an individual firm. We then examine what happens in the long run 
as firms enter and exit the industry. Next, we compare the equilibrium under 
monopo­listic competition to the equilibrium under perfect competition that we 
examined in Chapter 14. Finally, we consider whether the outcome in a monop­o­
listically competitive market is desirable from the standpoint of society as a whole.
The Monopolistically Competitive Firm  
in the Short Run
Each firm in a monopolistically competitive market is, in many ways, like a 
monopoly. Because its product is different from those offered by other firms, it 
faces a downward-sloping demand curve. (By contrast, a perfectly competitive 
firm faces a horizontal demand curve at the market price.) Thus, the monop­o­
listically competitive firm follows a monopolist’s rule for profit maximization: It 
chooses to produce the quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost 
and then uses its demand curve to find the price at which it can sell that quantity.
Figure 2 shows the cost, demand, and marginal-revenue curves for two typical 
firms, each in a different monopolistically competitive industry. In both panels 
of this figure, the profit-maximizing quantity is found at the intersection of the 
marginal-revenue and marginal-cost curves. The two panels in this figure show 
different outcomes for the firm’s profit. In panel (a), price exceeds average total 
cost, so the firm makes a profit. In panel (b), price is below average total cost. In 
this case, the firm is unable to make a positive profit, so the best the firm can do 
is to minimize its losses.
All this should seem familiar. A monopolistically competitive firm chooses its 
quantity and price just as a monopoly does. In the short run, these two types of 
market structure are similar.
The Long-Run Equilibrium
The situations depicted in Figure 2 do not last long. When firms are making 
profits, as in panel (a), new firms have an incentive to enter the market. This

Monopolistic competitors, like monopolists, maximize profit by producing the 
quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The firm in panel (a) makes 
a profit because, at this quantity, price is above average total cost. The firm in panel

entry increases the number of products from which customers can choose and, 
therefore, reduces the demand faced by each firm already in the market. In other 
words, profit encourages entry, and entry shifts the demand curves faced by the 
incumbent firms to the left. As the demand for incumbent firms’ products falls, 
these firms experience declining profit. 
Conversely, when firms are making losses, as in panel (b), firms in the market 
have an incentive to exit. As firms exit, customers have fewer products from which 
to choose. This decrease in the number of firms expands the demand faced by those 
firms that stay in the market. In other words, losses encourage exit, and exit shifts the 
demand curves of the remaining firms to the right. As the demand for the remaining 
firms’ products rises, these firms experience rising profits (that is, declining losses).
This process of entry and exit continues until the firms in the market are mak-
ing exactly zero economic profit. Figure 3 depicts the long-run equilibrium. Once 
the market reaches this equilibrium, new firms have no incentive to enter, and 
existing firms have no incentive to exit.
Notice that the demand curve in this figure just barely touches the average-
total-cost curve. Mathematically, we say the two curves are tangent to each other. 
These two curves must be tangent once entry and exit have driven profit to zero. 
Because profit per unit sold is the difference between price (found on the demand 
curve) and average total cost, the maximum profit is zero only if these two curves 
touch each other without crossing. Also note that this point of tangency occurs at 
the same quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. That these two 
points line up is not a coincidence: It is required because this particular quantity 
maximizes profit and the maximum profit is exactly zero in the long run.
To sum up, two characteristics describe the long-run equilibrium in a monopo-
listically competitive market:
• 	 As in a monopoly market, price exceeds marginal cost. This conclusion 
arises because profit maximization requires marginal revenue to equal 
Figure 3
A Monopolistic Competitor  
in the Long Run
In a monopolistically competitive 
market, if firms are making profit, 
new firms enter, and the demand 
curves for the incumbent firms 
shift to the left. Similarly, if firms 
are making losses, old firms exit, 
and the demand curves of the 
remaining firms shift to the right. 
Because of these shifts in demand, 
a monopolistically competitive firm 
eventually finds itself in the long-
run equilibrium shown here. In this 
long-run equilibrium, price equals 
average total cost, and the firm 
earns zero profit.

­marginal cost and because the downward-sloping demand curve makes 
marginal revenue less than the price.
• 	 As in a competitive market, price equals average total cost. This conclusion 
arises because free entry and exit drive economic profit to zero.
The second characteristic shows how monopolistic competition differs from 
monopoly. Because a monopoly is the sole seller of a product without close sub-
stitutes, it can earn positive economic profit, even in the long run. By contrast, 
because there is free entry into a monopolistically competitive market, the eco-
nomic profit of a firm in this type of market is driven to zero.
Monopolistic versus Perfect Competition
Figure 4 compares the long-run equilibrium under monopolistic competition to 
the long-run equilibrium under perfect competition. (Chapter 14 discussed the 
equilibrium with perfect competition.) There are two noteworthy differences 
between monopolistic and perfect competition: excess capacity and the markup.
Excess Capacity  As we have just seen, entry and exit drive each firm in a 
monopolistically competitive market to a point of tangency between its demand 
and average-total-cost curves. Panel (a) of Figure 4 shows that the quantity of 
output at this point is smaller than the quantity that minimizes average total cost. 
Thus, under monopolistic competition, firms produce on the downward-sloping

Figure 4
Panel (a) shows the long-run equilibrium in a monopolistically competitive market, 
and panel (b) shows the long-run equilibrium in a perfectly competitive market. Two 
differences are notable. (1) The perfectly competitive firm produces at the efficient 
scale, where average total cost is minimized. By contrast, the monopolistically 
competitive firm produces at less than the efficient scale. (2) Price equals marginal 
cost under perfect competition, but price is above marginal cost under monopolistic 
competition.

portion of their average-total-cost curves. In this way, monopolistic competition 
contrasts starkly with perfect competition. As panel (b) of Figure 4 shows, free 
entry in competitive markets drives firms to produce at the minimum of average 
total cost.
The quantity that minimizes average total cost is called the efficient scale of the 
firm. In the long run, perfectly competitive firms produce at the efficient scale, 
whereas monopolistically competitive firms produce below this level. Firms are 
said to have excess capacity under monopolistic competition. In other words, a 
monopolistically competitive firm, unlike a perfectly competitive firm, could 
increase the quantity it produces and lower the average total cost of production. 
The firm forgoes this opportunity because it would need to cut its price to sell the 
additional output. It is more profitable for a monopolistic competitor to continue 
operating with excess capacity.
Markup over Marginal Cost  A second difference between perfect competi-
tion and monopolistic competition is the relationship between price and marginal 
cost. For a competitive firm, such as that shown in panel (b) of Figure 4, price 
equals marginal cost. For a monopolistically competitive firm, such as that shown 
in panel (a), price exceeds marginal cost because the firm always has some market 
power.
How is this markup over marginal cost consistent with free entry and zero 
profit? The zero-profit condition ensures only that price equals average total cost. 
It does not ensure that price equals marginal cost. Indeed, in the long-run equilib-
rium, monopolistically competitive firms operate on the declining portion of their 
average-total-cost curves, so marginal cost is below average total cost. Thus, for 
price to equal average total cost, price must be above marginal cost.
In this relationship between price and marginal cost, we see a key behavioral 
difference between perfect competitors and monopolistic competitors. Imagine 
that you were to ask a firm the following question: “Would you like to see 
another customer come through your door ready to buy from you at your current 
price?” A perfectly competitive firm would answer that it didn’t care. Because 
price exactly equals marginal cost, the profit from an extra unit sold is zero. By 
contrast, a monopolistically competitive firm is always eager to get another cus-
tomer. Because its price exceeds marginal cost, an extra unit sold at the posted 
price means more profit. 
According to an old quip, monopolistically competitive markets are those in 
which sellers send Christmas cards to the buyers. Trying to attract more custom-
ers makes sense only if price exceeds marginal cost.
Monopolistic Competition and  
the Welfare of Society
Is the outcome in a monopolistically competitive market desirable from the stand-
point of society as a whole? Can policymakers improve on the market outcome? In 
previous chapters we evaluated markets from the standpoint of efficiency—that 
is, whether society is getting the most it can out of its scarce resources. We learned 
that competitive markets lead to efficient outcomes, unless there are externalities, 
and that monopoly markets lead to deadweight losses. Monopolistically com-
petitive markets are more complex than either of these polar cases, so evaluating 
welfare in these markets is a more subtle exercise.
One source of inefficiency is the markup of price over marginal cost. Because 
of the markup, some consumers who value the good at more than the marginal

CHAPTER 16    Monopolistic Competition
cost of production (but less than the price) will be deterred from buying it. Thus, 
a monopolistically competitive market has the normal deadweight loss of monop-
oly pricing.
Although this outcome is undesirable compared to the first-best outcome of 
price equal to marginal cost, there is no easy way for policymakers to fix the 
problem. To enforce marginal-cost pricing, policymakers would need to regu-
late all firms that produce differentiated products. Because such products are so 
common in the economy, the administrative burden of such regulation would be 
overwhelming.
Moreover, regulating monopolistic competitors would entail all the problems 
of regulating natural monopolies. In particular, because monopolistic competi-
tors are making zero profits already, requiring them to lower their prices to equal 
marginal cost would cause them to make losses. To keep these firms in business, 
the government would need to help them cover these losses. Rather than raise 
taxes to pay for these subsidies, policymakers may decide it is better to live with 
the inefficiency of monopolistic pricing. 
Another way in which monopolistic competition may be socially inefficient is 
that the number of firms in the market may not be “ideal.” That is, there may be 
too much or too little entry. One way to think about this problem is in terms of the 
externalities associated with entry. Whenever a new firm considers entering the 
market with a new product, it takes into account only the profit it would make. 
Yet its entry would also have two effects that are external to the firm:
• 	 The product-variety externality: Because consumers get some consumer sur-
plus from the introduction of a new product, entry of a new firm conveys a 
positive externality on consumers. 
• 	 The business-stealing externality: Because other firms lose customers and 
­profits from the entry of a new competitor, entry of a new firm imposes a 
negative externality on existing firms.
Thus, in a monopolistically competitive market, there are positive and negative 
externalities associated with the entry of new firms. Depending on which exter-
nality is larger, a monopolistically competitive market could have either too few 
or too many products.
Both of these externalities are closely related to the conditions for monopolistic 
competition. The product-variety externality arises because a new firm would 
offer a product different from those of the existing firms. The business-stealing 
externality arises because firms post a price above marginal cost and, therefore, 
are always eager to sell additional units. Conversely, because perfectly competi-
tive firms produce identical goods and charge a price equal to marginal cost, nei-
ther of these externalities exists under perfect competition.
In the end, we can conclude only that monopolistically competitive markets 
do not have all the desirable welfare properties of perfectly competitive mar-
kets. That is, the invisible hand does not ensure that total surplus is maximized 
under monopolistic competition. Yet because the inefficiencies are subtle, hard to 
­measure, and hard to fix, there is no easy way for public policy to improve the 
market outcome.

Advertising
It is nearly impossible to go through a typical day in a modern economy with-
out being bombarded with advertising. Whether you are reading a newspaper, 
watching television, surfing the Internet, or driving down the highway, some 
firm will try to convince you to buy its product. Such behavior is a natural 
feature of monopolistic competition (as well as some oligopolistic industries). 
When firms sell differentiated products and charge prices above marginal cost, 
each firm has an incentive to advertise to attract more buyers to its particular 
product.
If the Shoe Doesn’t Fit
By Joel Waldfogel
L
ast week, Nike unveiled a shoe designed 
specifically for American Indians. The 
sneaker has both a native-theme design 
and—more importantly—a wider shape 
to accommodate the distinctly shaped feet 
of American Indians. With diabetes and 
related conditions near epidemic levels in 
some tribes, American Indian leaders were 
happy to welcome this comfortable product. 
If anything, what seems odd is that it took 
so long. After all, free-market economists 
have told us for decades that we should rely 
on market decisions, not the government, 
to meet our needs, because it’s the market 
that satisfies everyone’s every desire. 
And yet it turns out that it’s the Indians’ 
long wait for a good sneaker that’s typical. 
For small groups with preferences outside 
the norm, the market often fails to deliver, 
as I argue in my new book, The Tyranny 
of the Market: Why You Can’t Always Get 
What You Want. 
John Stuart Mill pointed out that voting 
gives rise to a tyranny of the majority. If 
we vote on what color shirts to make—or 
whether to make wide or narrow shoes—
then the majority gets what it prefers, and 
the minority does not. The market, on the 
other hand, is supposed to work differently. 
As Milton Friedman eloquently put it in 
1962, “the characteristic feature of action 
through political channels is that it tends 
to require or enforce substantial conformity. 
The great advantage of the market is that it 
permits wide diversity. Each man can vote, 
as it were, for the color of tie he wants and 
get it; he does not have to see what color 
the majority wants and then, if he is in the 
minority, submit.” This is a wonderful argu-
ment. Except that for many products and for 
many people, it’s wrong. 
Two simple conditions that prevail in 
many markets mean that individual taste 
alone doesn’t determine individual satisfac-
tion. These conditions are (1) big setup costs 
and (2) preferences that differ across groups; 
when they’re present, an individual’s sat-
isfaction is a function of how many people 
share his or her tastes. In other words, in 
these cases, markets share some of the 
objectionable features of government. They 
give bigger groups more and better options.
 Insufficient Variety as a Market Failure
University of Pennsylvania economist Joel Waldfogel argues that, in 
the presence of large fixed costs, the market may insufficiently service 
­customers with unusual preferences.

CHAPTER 16    Monopolistic Competition
The amount of advertising varies substantially across products. Firms that sell 
highly differentiated consumer goods, such as over-the-counter drugs, perfumes, 
soft drinks, razor blades, breakfast cereals, and dog food, typically spend between 
10 and 20 percent of revenue for advertising. Firms that sell industrial products, 
such as drill presses and communications satellites, typically spend very little on 
advertising. And firms that sell homogeneous products, such as wheat, peanuts, 
or crude oil, spend nothing at all. 
For the economy as a whole, about 2 percent of total firm revenue is spent on 
advertising. This spending takes many forms, including commercials on televi-
sion and radio, space in newspapers and magazines, direct mail, the yellow pages, 
billboards, and ads on websites.

In my research, I’ve discovered that this 
phenomenon is widespread. Ten years ago, 
I started studying radio-station listening 
patterns. I noticed that people listened to 
the radio more in metro areas of the United 
States with relatively large populations. This 
is not terribly surprising. In larger cities, 
more stations can attract enough listeners 
and advertising revenue to cover their costs 
and stay on the air. With more to choose 
from on the dial, residents tune in more. 
So, in this situation of high fixed costs 
(each station needs a following to keep 
broad­casting), people help one another by 
making more options viable.
But who benefits whom? When I looked 
at black and white listeners separately, I 
noticed something surprising. Blacks listen 
more in cities with larger black populations, 
and whites listen more in cities with larger 
white populations. Black listening does not 
increase where there’s a higher white popu-
lation, and white listening does not increase 
with a higher black population. Which 
means that while overall people help each 
other by increasing the number of stations 
on the dial, blacks do not help whites, and 
whites do not help blacks. Similar patterns 
arise for Hispanics and non-Hispanics.
A closer look at the data—necessary only 
because I’m a middle-aged white ­economist—
showed why this was ­happening. Blacks and 
whites don’t listen to the same radio stations. 
The black-targeted formats account for about 
two-thirds of black listening and only 3 per-
cent of white listening. Similarly, the formats 
that attract the largest white audiences, like 
country, attract almost no blacks. This means 
that if you dropped Larry the Cable Guy and a 
few thousand of his friends from a helicopter 
(with parachutes) into a metro area, you’d 
create more demand for country and perhaps 
album-rock stations, which would be nice for 
white listeners. But the influx wouldn’t help 
black listeners at all.
In this example, different population 
groups don’t help each other, but they 
don’t hurt each other, either. Sometimes, 
though, the effect that groups have on 
each other through the market is actually 
negative. Industries like daily newspapers 
offer essentially one product per market. 
Because the paper can be pitched to appeal 
to one group or another, the larger one 
group is, the less the product is tailored 
to anyone else. This is the tyranny of the 
majority translated almost literally from 
politics into markets.
This brings us back to Nike’s new shoe. 
Foot Locker is full of options that fit me 
and most other Americans. But American 
Indians make up just 1.5 percent of the U.S. 
population, and with feet on average three 
sizes wider, they need different-sized shoes. 
If we had all voted in a national election 
on whether the Ministry of Shoes should 
make wide or typical-width shoes, we surely 
would have chosen the latter. That’s why 
Friedman condemned government alloca-
tion. And yet the market made the same 
choice. If Nike’s announcement looks like a 
solution to this problem of ignored minority 
preference, it really isn’t. The company took 
too many years to bring the shoe on line, 
and according to the Associated Press, the 
new sneaker “represents less of a financial 
opportunity than a goodwill and branding 
effort.”
The tyranny of the market arises else-
where. With drug development costs near 
$1 billion, if you are going to be sick, hope 
that your disease is common enough to 
attract the interest of drug makers. If you 
want to fly from your town to Chicago, 
hope that your city is big enough to fill a 
plane every day.
When you’re not so lucky, you benefit 
when the government steps in on your 
behalf, with subsidies for research on 
drugs for rare diseases or for air service to 
small locales. For a generation, influential 
economists have argued for letting the 
market decide a wide array of questions, to 
protect your freedom to choose whatever 
you want. This is true—if everyone agrees 
with you.

The Debate over Advertising
Is society wasting the resources it devotes to advertising? Or does advertising serve a 
valuable purpose? Assessing the social value of advertising is difficult and often gen-
erates heated argument among economists. Let’s consider both sides of the debate.
The Critique of Advertising  Critics of advertising argue that firms adver-
tise to manipulate people’s tastes. Much advertising is psychological rather than 
informational. Consider, for example, the typical television commercial for some 
brand of soft drink. The commercial most likely does not tell the viewer about 
the product’s price or quality. Instead, it might show a group of happy people 
at a party on a beach on a beautiful sunny day. In their hands are cans of the 
soft drink. The goal of the commercial is to convey a subconscious (if not subtle) 
message: “You too can have many friends and be happy, if only you drink our 
product.” Critics of advertising argue that such a commercial creates a desire that 
otherwise might not exist.
Critics also argue that advertising impedes competition. Advertising often tries 
to convince consumers that products are more different than they truly are. By 
increasing the perception of product differentiation and fostering brand loyalty, 
advertising makes buyers less concerned with price differences among similar 
goods. With a less elastic demand curve, each firm charges a larger markup over 
marginal cost.
The Defense of Advertising  Defenders of advertising argue that firms use 
advertising to provide information to customers. Advertising conveys the prices 
of the goods offered for sale, the existence of new products, and the locations of 
retail outlets. This information allows customers to make better choices about what 
to buy and, thus, enhances the ability of markets to allocate resources efficiently.
Defenders also argue that advertising fosters competition. Because advertising 
allows customers to be more fully informed about all the firms in the market, cus-
tomers can more easily take advantage of price differences. Thus, each firm has 
less market power. In addition, advertising allows new firms to enter more easily 
because it gives entrants a means to attract customers from existing firms.
Over time, policymakers have come to accept the view that advertising can 
make markets more competitive. One important example is the regulation of 
advertising for certain professions, such as lawyers, doctors, and pharmacists. In 
the past, these groups succeeded in getting state governments to prohibit advertis-
ing in their fields on the grounds that advertising was “unprofessional.” In recent 
years, however, the courts have concluded that the primary effect of these restric-
tions on advertising was to curtail competition. They have, therefore, overturned 
many of the laws that prohibit advertising by members of these professions. 
Advertising and the Price
of Eyeglasses
What effect does advertising have on the price of a good? On the one hand, 
advertising might make consumers view products as being more different than 
they otherwise would. If so, it would make markets less competitive and firms’ 
demand curves less elastic, and this would lead firms to charge higher prices. On 
the other hand, advertising might make it easier for consumers to find the firms 
offering the best prices. In this case, it would make markets more competitive and 
firms’ demand curves more elastic, which would lead to lower prices.

CHAPTER 16    Monopolistic Competition
In an article published in the Journal of Law and Economics in 1972, economist 
Lee Benham tested these two views of advertising. In the United States during the 
1960s, the various state governments had vastly different rules about advertising 
by optometrists. Some states allowed advertising for eyeglasses and eye examina-
tions. Many states, however, prohibited it. For example, the Florida law read as 
follows:
It is unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to . . . advertise either directly 
or indirectly by any means whatsoever any definite or indefinite price or credit 
terms on prescriptive or corrective lens, frames, complete prescriptive or cor-
rective glasses, or any optometric service. . . . This section is passed in the inter-
est of public health, safety, and welfare, and its provisions shall be liberally 
construed to carry out its objects and purposes.
Professional optometrists enthusiastically endorsed these restrictions on advertising.
Benham used the differences in state law as a natural experiment to test the 
two views of advertising. The results were striking. In those states that prohib-
ited advertising, the average price paid for a pair of eyeglasses was $33. (This 
number is not as low as it seems, for this price is from 1963, when all prices 
were much lower than they are today. To convert 1963 prices into today’s dol-
lars, you can multiply them by about 7.) In states that did not restrict advertis-
ing, the average price was $26. Thus, advertising reduced average prices by 
more than 20 percent. In the market for eyeglasses, and probably in many other 
markets as well, advertising fosters competition and leads to lower prices for 
consumers.  ■
Advertising as a Signal of Quality
Many types of advertising contain little apparent information about the product 
being advertised. Consider a firm introducing a new breakfast cereal. A typical 
advertisement might have some highly paid actor eating the cereal and exclaim-
ing how wonderful it tastes. How much information does the advertisement 
really provide?
The answer is more than you might think. Defenders of advertising argue that 
even advertising that appears to contain little hard information may in fact tell 
consumers something about product quality. The willingness of the firm to spend 
a large amount of money on advertising can itself be a signal to consumers about 
the quality of the product being offered.
Consider the problem facing two firms—Post and Kellogg. Each company has 
just come up with a recipe for a new cereal, which it would sell for $3 a box. To 
keep things simple, let’s assume that the marginal cost of making cereal is zero, so 
the $3 is all profit. Each company knows that if it spends $10 million on advertis-
ing, it will get 1 million consumers to try its new cereal. And each company knows 
that if consumers like the cereal, they will buy it not once but many times. 
First consider Post’s decision. Based on market research, Post knows that 
its cereal is only mediocre. Although advertising would sell one box to each of 
1 ­million consumers, the consumers would quickly learn that the cereal is not very 
good and stop buying it. Post decides it is not worth paying $10 million in adver-
tising to get only $3 million in sales. So it does not bother to advertise. It sends its 
cooks back to the test kitchen to find another recipe. 
Kellogg, on the other hand, knows that its cereal is great. Each person who tries 
it will buy a box a month for the next year. Thus, the $10 million in advertising 
will bring in $36 million in sales. Advertising is profitable here because Kellogg

has a good product that consumers will buy repeatedly. Thus, Kellogg chooses to 
advertise.
Now that we have considered the behavior of the two firms, let’s consider the 
behavior of consumers. We began by asserting that consumers are inclined to try 
a new cereal that they see advertised. But is this behavior rational? Should a con-
sumer try a new cereal just because the seller has chosen to advertise it?
In fact, it may be completely rational for consumers to try new products that 
they see advertised. In our story, consumers decide to try Kellogg’s new cereal 
because Kellogg advertises. Kellogg chooses to advertise because it knows that 
its cereal is quite good, while Post chooses not to advertise because it knows 
that its cereal is mediocre. By its willingness to spend money on advertising,

 Galbraith versus Hayek
T
wo great economists of the 20th century were 
John Kenneth Galbraith and Friedrich Hayek. 
They held very different views about advertising, 
which reflected their views about the capitalist 
system more broadly.
John Kenneth Galbraith’s most famous book 
was The Affluent Society, published in 1958. 
In it, he argued that corporations use advertis-
ing to create demand for products that people 
otherwise do not want or need. The market 
system should not be applauded, he believed, 
for satisfying desires that it has itself created. 
Galbraith was skeptical that economic growth 
was leading to higher levels of well-being, 
because people’s aspirations were being made 
to keep pace with their increased material 
prosperity. He worried that as advertising and 
salesmanship artificially enhanced the desire for 
private goods, public spending on such items 
as better schools and better parks suffered. 
The result, according to Galbraith, was “private 
opulence and public squalor.” Galbraith’s policy 
recommendation was clear: Increase the size of 
government.
Friedrich Hayek’s most famous book was The 
Road to Serfdom, published in 1944. It argued 
that an expansive government inevitably means 
a sacrifice of personal freedoms. Hayek also 
wrote a well-known critique of Galbraith in 
1961, addressing specifically Galbraith’s view of 
advertising. Hayek observed that advertising was 
merely one example of a larger phenomenon: 
Our social environment creates many of our 
preferences. Literature, art, and music are all 
acquired tastes. A person’s demand for hearing 
a Mozart concerto may have been created in a 
music appreciation class, but this fact does not 
make the desire less legitimate or the music pro-
fessor a sinister influence. Hayek concluded, “It is 
because each individual producer thinks that the 
consumers can be persuaded to like his products 
that he endeavors to influence them. But though 
this effort is part of the influences which shape 
consumers’ taste, no producer can in any real 
sense ‘determine’ them.”
These two economists disagreed about the 
roles of advertising, markets, and government, 
but they did have one thing in common: great 
acclaim. In 1974, Hayek won the Nobel Prize in 
economics. In 2000, President Clinton awarded 
Galbraith the National Medal of Freedom. And 
even though their books are now many decades 
old, they are still well worth reading. The issues 
that Hayek and Galbraith addressed are time-
less, and their insights apply as well to our 
economy as to their own.

CHAPTER 16    Monopolistic Competition
Kellogg signals to consumers the quality of its cereal. Each consumer thinks, 
quite sensibly, “Boy, if the Kellogg Company is willing to spend so much money 
advertising this new cereal, it must be really good.”
What is most surprising about this theory of advertising is that the content of 
the advertisement is irrelevant. Kellogg signals the quality of its product by its 
willingness to spend money on advertising. What the advertisements say is not as 
important as the fact that consumers know ads are expensive. By contrast, cheap 
advertising cannot be effective at signaling quality to consumers. In our example, 
if an advertising campaign cost less than $3 million, both Post and Kellogg would 
use it to market their new cereals. Because both good and mediocre cereals would 
be advertised, consumers could not infer the quality of a new cereal from the 
fact that it is advertised. Over time, consumers would learn to ignore such cheap 
advertising.
This theory can explain why firms pay famous actors large amounts of money 
to make advertisements that, on the surface, appear to convey no information at 
all. The information is not in the advertisement’s content but simply in its exis­
tence and expense.
Brand Names
Advertising is closely related to the existence of brand names. In many markets, 
there are two types of firms. Some firms sell products with widely recognized 
brand names, while other firms sell generic substitutes. For example, in a typi-
cal drugstore, you can find Bayer aspirin on the shelf next to generic aspirin. In 
a typical grocery store, you can find Pepsi next to less familiar colas. Most often, 
the firm with the brand name spends more on advertising and charges a higher 
price for its product. 
Just as there is disagreement about the economics of advertising, there is disagree-
ment about the economics of brand names. Let’s consider both sides of the debate.
Critics argue that brand names cause consumers to perceive differences that do 
not really exist. In many cases, the generic good is almost indistinguishable from the 
brand-name good. Consumers’ willingness to pay more for the brand-name good, 
these critics assert, is a form of irrationality fostered by advertising. Economist 
Edward Chamberlin, one of the early developers of the theory of monopolistic 
competition, concluded from this argument that brand names were bad for the 
economy. He proposed that the government discourage their use by refusing to 
enforce the exclusive trademarks that companies use to identify their products.
More recently, economists have defended brand names as a useful way for 
consumers to ensure that the goods they buy are of high quality. There are two 
related arguments. First, brand names provide consumers with information about 
quality when quality cannot be easily judged in advance of purchase. Second, 
brand names give firms an incentive to maintain high quality because firms have a 
financial stake in maintaining the reputation of their brand names.
To see how these arguments work in practice, consider a famous brand name: 
McDonald’s hamburgers. Imagine that you are driving through an unfamiliar 
town and want to stop for lunch. You see a McDonald’s and a local restaurant 
next to it. Which do you choose? The local restaurant may in fact offer better food 
at lower prices, but you have no way of knowing that. By contrast, McDonald’s 
offers a consistent product across many cities. Its brand name is useful to you as 
a way of judging the quality of what you are about to buy.
The McDonald’s brand name also ensures that the company has an incentive 
to maintain quality. For example, if some customers were to become ill from

bad food sold at a McDonald’s, the news would be disastrous for the company. 
McDonald’s would lose much of the valuable reputation that it has built up with 
years of expensive advertising. As a result, it would lose sales and profit not just 
in the outlet that sold the bad food but in its many outlets throughout the country. 
By contrast, if some customers were to become ill from bad food at a local restau-
rant, that restaurant might have to close down, but the lost profits would be much 
smaller. Hence, McDonald’s has a greater incentive to ensure that its food is safe.
The debate over brand names thus centers on the question of whether consum-
ers are rational in preferring brand names to generic substitutes. Critics argue 
that brand names are the result of an irrational consumer response to advertising. 
Defenders argue that consumers have good reason to pay more for brand-name 
products because they can be more confident in the quality of these products. 
Quick Quiz  How might advertising make markets less competitive? How might it 
make markets more competitive? • Give the arguments for and against brand names.
Conclusion
Monopolistic competition is true to its name: It is a hybrid of monopoly and 
competition. Like a monopoly, each monopolistic competitor faces a downward-
sloping demand curve and, as a result, charges a price above marginal cost. As 
in a perfectly competitive market, there are many firms, and entry and exit drive 
the profit of each monopolistic competitor toward zero in the long run. Table 1 
summarizes these lessons.
Because monopolistically competitive firms produce differentiated products, 
each firm advertises to attract customers to its own brand. To some extent, adver-
tising manipulates consumers’ tastes, promotes irrational brand loyalty, and 
impedes competition. To a larger extent, advertising provides information, estab-
lishes brand names of reliable quality, and fosters competition. 
The theory of monopolistic competition seems to describe many markets in 
the economy. It is somewhat disappointing, therefore, that the theory does not 
yield simple and compelling advice for public policy. From the standpoint of the 
economic theorist, the allocation of resources in monopolistically competitive 
markets is not perfect. Yet from the standpoint of a practical policymaker, there 
may be little that can be done to improve it.

Summary
• A monopolistically competitive market is char-
acterized by three attributes: many firms, differ-
entiated products, and free entry.
• The equilibrium in a monopolistically competi-
tive market differs from that in a perfectly com-
petitive market in two related ways. First, each 
firm in a monopolistically competitive market 
has excess capacity. That is, it operates on the 
downward-sloping portion of the average-total-
cost curve. Second, each firm charges a price 
above marginal cost.
• Monopolistic competition does not have all 
the desirable properties of perfect competi-
tion. There is the standard deadweight loss of 
monopoly caused by the markup of price over 
marginal cost. In addition, the number of firms 
(and thus the variety of products) can be too 
large or too small. In practice, the ability of 
policymakers to correct these inefficiencies is 
limited.
• The product differentiation inherent in monopo-
listic competition leads to the use of ­advertising 
and brand names. Critics of advertising and 
brand names argue that firms use them to 
manipulate consumers’ tastes and to reduce 
competition. Defenders of advertising and 
brand names argue that firms use them to 
inform consumers and to compete more vigor-
ously on price and product quality.
