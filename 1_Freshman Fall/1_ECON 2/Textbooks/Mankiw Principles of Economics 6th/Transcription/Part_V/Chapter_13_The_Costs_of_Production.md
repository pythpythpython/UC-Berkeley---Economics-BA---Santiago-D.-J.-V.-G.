The Costs of 
    Production
T
he economy is made up of thousands of firms that produce the goods 
and services you enjoy every day: General Motors produces automo-
biles, General Electric produces lightbulbs, and General Mills produces 
breakfast cereals. Some firms, such as these three, are large; they employ 
thousands of workers and have thousands of stockholders who share in the firms’ 
profits. Other firms, such as the local barbershop or candy store, are small; they 
employ only a few workers and are owned by a single person or family.
In previous chapters, we used the supply curve to summarize firms’ produc-
tion decisions. According to the law of supply, firms are willing to produce and 
sell a greater quantity of a good when the price of the good is higher, and this 
response leads to a supply curve that slopes upward. For analyzing many ques-
tions, the law of supply is all you need to know about firm behavior.
In this chapter and the ones that follow, we examine firm behavior in more 
detail. This topic will give you a better understanding of the decisions behind 
the supply curve. In addition, it will introduce you to a part of economics called

industrial organization—the study of how firms’ decisions about prices and quanti-
ties depend on the market conditions they face. The town in which you live, for 
instance, may have several pizzerias but only one cable television company. This 
raises a key question: How does the number of firms affect the prices in a market 
and the efficiency of the market outcome? The field of industrial organization 
addresses exactly this question.
Before turning to these issues, we need to discuss the costs of production. All 
firms, from Delta Air Lines to your local deli, incur costs as they make the goods 
and services that they sell. As we will see in the coming chapters, a firm’s costs 
are a key determinant of its production and pricing decisions. In this chapter, we 
define some of the variables that economists use to measure a firm’s costs, and we 
consider the relationships among these variables. 
A word of warning: This topic is dry and technical. To be honest, one might 
even call it boring. But this material provides a crucial foundation for the fascinat-
ing topics that follow. 
What Are Costs?
We begin our discussion of costs at Caroline’s Cookie Factory. Caroline, the owner 
of the firm, buys flour, sugar, chocolate chips, and other cookie ingredients. She also 
buys the mixers and ovens and hires workers to run this equipment. She then sells 
the cookies to consumers. By examining some of the issues that Caroline faces in her 
business, we can learn some lessons about costs that apply to all firms in an economy.
Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Profit
We begin with the firm’s objective. To understand the decisions a firm makes, we 
must understand what it is trying to do. It is conceivable that Caroline started her 
firm because of an altruistic desire to provide the world with cookies or, perhaps, 
out of love for the cookie business. More likely, Caroline started her business to 
make money. Economists normally assume that the goal of a firm is to maximize 
profit, and they find that this assumption works well in most cases.
What is a firm’s profit? The amount that the firm receives for the sale of its 
output (cookies) is called its total revenue. The amount that the firm pays to buy 
inputs (flour, sugar, workers, ovens, and so forth) is called its total cost. Caroline 
gets to keep any revenue that is not needed to cover costs. Profit is a firm’s total 
revenue minus its total cost: 
Profit = Total revenue – Total cost.
Caroline’s objective is to make her firm’s profit as large as possible.
To see how a firm goes about maximizing profit, we must consider fully how to 
measure its total revenue and its total cost. Total revenue is the easy part: It equals 
the quantity of output the firm produces times the price at which it sells its output. 
If Caroline produces 10,000 cookies and sells them at $2 a cookie, her total revenue 
is $20,000. By contrast, the measurement of a firm’s total cost is more subtle.
Costs as Opportunity Costs
When measuring costs at Caroline’s Cookie Factory or any other firm, it is impor-
tant to keep in mind one of the Ten Principles of Economics from Chapter 1: The 
cost of something is what you give up to get it. Recall that the opportunity cost of 
total revenue
the amount a firm 
receives for the sale of its 
output
total cost
the market value of the 
inputs a firm uses in 
production
profit
total revenue minus total 
cost

an item refers to all those things that must be forgone to acquire that item. When 
economists speak of a firm’s cost of production, they include all the opportunity 
costs of making its output of goods and services.
While some of a firm’s opportunity costs of production are obvious, others 
are less so. When Caroline pays $1,000 for flour, that $1,000 is an opportunity 
cost because Caroline can no longer use that $1,000 to buy something else. 
Similarly, when Caroline hires workers to make the cookies, the wages she pays 
are part of the firm’s costs. Because these opportunity costs require the firm to 
pay out some money, they are called explicit costs. By contrast, some of a firm’s 
opportunity costs, called implicit costs, do not require a cash outlay. Imagine 
that Caroline is skilled with computers and could earn $100 per hour working 
as a programmer. For every hour that Caroline works at her cookie factory, she 
gives up $100 in income, and this forgone income is also part of her costs. The 
total cost of Caroline’s business is the sum of the explicit costs and the implicit 
costs.
The distinction between explicit and implicit costs highlights an important dif-
ference between how economists and accountants analyze a business. Economists 
are interested in studying how firms make production and pricing decisions. 
Because these decisions are based on both explicit and implicit costs, economists 
include both when measuring a firm’s costs. By contrast, accountants have the job 
of keeping track of the money that flows into and out of firms. As a result, they 
measure the explicit costs but usually ignore the implicit costs.
The difference between economists and accountants is easy to see in the case 
of Caroline’s Cookie Factory. When Caroline gives up the opportunity to earn 
money as a computer programmer, her accountant will not count this as a cost of 
her cookie business. Because no money flows out of the business to pay for this 
cost, it never shows up on the accountant’s financial statements. An economist, 
however, will count the forgone income as a cost because it will affect the deci-
sions that Caroline makes in her cookie business. For example, if Caroline’s wage 
as a computer programmer rises from $100 to $500 per hour, she might decide that 
running her cookie business is too costly and choose to shut down the factory to 
become a full-time computer programmer. 
The Cost of Capital as an Opportunity Cost
An important implicit cost of almost every business is the opportunity cost of the 
financial capital that has been invested in the business. Suppose, for instance, that 
Caroline used $300,000 of her savings to buy her cookie factory from its previous 
owner. If Caroline had instead left this money deposited in a savings account that 
pays an interest rate of 5 percent, she would have earned $15,000 per year. To 
own her cookie factory, therefore, Caroline has given up $15,000 a year in interest 
income. This forgone $15,000 is one of the implicit opportunity costs of Caroline’s 
business.
As we have already noted, economists and accountants treat costs differently, 
and this is especially true in their treatment of the cost of capital. An economist 
views the $15,000 in interest income that Caroline gives up every year as a cost of 
her business, even though it is an implicit cost. Caroline’s accountant, however, 
will not show this $15,000 as a cost because no money flows out of the business 
to pay for it.
To further explore the difference between economists and accountants, let’s change 
the example slightly. Suppose now that Caroline did not have the entire $300,000 to 
buy the factory but, instead, used $100,000 of her own savings and borrowed $200,000

from a bank at an interest rate of 5 percent. Caroline’s accountant, who only measures 
explicit costs, will now count the $10,000 interest paid on the bank loan every year as 
a cost because this amount of money now flows out of the firm. By contrast, accord-
ing to an economist, the opportunity cost of owning the business is still $15,000. The 
opportunity cost equals the interest on the bank loan (an explicit cost of $10,000) plus 
the forgone interest on savings (an implicit cost of $5,000). 
Economic Profit versus Accounting Profit
Now let’s return to the firm’s objective: profit. Because economists and accoun-
tants measure costs differently, they also measure profit differently. An econo-
mist measures a firm’s economic profit as the firm’s total revenue minus all the 
opportunity costs (explicit and implicit) of producing the goods and services sold. 
An accountant measures the firm’s accounting profit as the firm’s total revenue 
minus only the firm’s explicit costs. 
Figure 1 summarizes this difference. Notice that because the accountant 
ignores the implicit costs, accounting profit is usually larger than economic profit. 
For a business to be profitable from an economist’s standpoint, total revenue must 
cover all the opportunity costs, both explicit and implicit. 
Economic profit is an important concept because it is what motivates the firms 
that supply goods and services. As we will see, a firm making positive economic 
profit will stay in business. It is covering all its opportunity costs and has some rev-
enue left to reward the firm owners. When a firm is making economic losses (that 
is, when economic profits are negative), the business owners are failing to earn 
enough revenue to cover all the costs of production. Unless conditions change, 
the firm owners will eventually close down the business and exit the industry. To 
understand business decisions, we need to keep an eye on economic profit.
Quick Quiz  Farmer McDonald gives banjo lessons for $20 an hour. One day, he 
spends 10 hours planting $100 worth of seeds on his farm. What opportunity cost has 
he incurred? What cost would his accountant measure? If these seeds yield $200 worth 
of crops, does McDonald earn an accounting profit? Does he earn an economic profit?

Economists versus Accountants
Economists include all opportunity 
costs when analyzing a firm, 
whereas accountants measure only 
explicit costs. Therefore, economic 
profit is smaller than accounting 
profit.

Production and Costs
Firms incur costs when they buy inputs to produce the goods and services that 
they plan to sell. In this section, we examine the link between a firm’s pro-
duction process and its total cost. Once again, we consider Caroline’s Cookie 
Factory.
In the analysis that follows, we make an important simplifying assumption: 
We assume that the size of Caroline’s factory is fixed and that Caroline can vary 
the quantity of cookies produced only by changing the number of workers she 
employs. This assumption is realistic in the short run but not in the long run. That 
is, Caroline cannot build a larger factory overnight, but she can do so over the 
next year or two. This analysis, therefore, describes the production decisions that 
Caroline faces in the short run. We examine the relationship between costs and 
time horizon more fully later in the chapter.
The Production Function
Table 1 shows how the quantity of cookies produced per hour at Caroline’s fac-
tory depends on the number of workers. As you can see in the first two columns, 
if there are no workers in the factory, Caroline produces no cookies. When there 
is 1 worker, she produces 50 cookies. When there are 2 workers, she produces 90 
cookies and so on. Panel (a) of Figure 2 presents a graph of these two columns 
of numbers. The number of workers is on the horizontal axis, and the number of 
cookies produced is on the vertical axis. This relationship between the quantity 
of inputs (workers) and quantity of output (cookies) is called the production 
function.

One of the Ten Principles of Economics introduced in Chapter 1 is that rational 
people think at the margin. As we will see in future chapters, this idea is the key 
to understanding the decisions a firm makes about how many workers to hire 
and how much output to produce. To take a step toward understanding these 
decisions, the third column in the table gives the marginal product of a worker. 
The marginal product of any input in the production process is the increase in 
the quantity of output obtained from one additional unit of that input. When the 
number of workers goes from 1 to 2, cookie production increases from 50 to 90, so 
the marginal product of the second worker is 40 cookies. And when the number of 
workers goes from 2 to 3, cookie production increases from 90 to 120, so the mar-
ginal product of the third worker is 30 cookies. In the table, the marginal product 
is shown halfway between two rows because it represents the change in output as 
the number of workers increases from one level to another.
Notice that as the number of workers increases, the marginal product declines. 
The second worker has a marginal product of 40 cookies, the third worker has a 
marginal product
the increase in output 
that arises from an 
additional unit of input
Figure 2
The production function in panel (a) shows the relationship between the number of 
workers hired and the quantity of output produced. Here the number of workers 
hired (on the horizontal axis) is from the first column in Table 1, and the quantity 
of output produced (on the vertical axis) is from the second column. The production 
function gets flatter as the number of workers increases, which reflects diminishing 
marginal product. The total-cost curve in panel (b) shows the relationship between the 
quantity of output produced and total cost of production. Here the quantity of output 
produced (on the horizontal axis) is from the second column in Table 1, and the total 
cost (on the vertical axis) is from the sixth column. The total-cost curve gets steeper as 
the quantity of output increases because of diminishing marginal product.

marginal product of 30 cookies, and the fourth worker has a marginal product 
of 20 cookies. This property is called diminishing marginal product. At first, 
when only a few workers are hired, they have easy access to Caroline’s kitchen 
equipment. As the number of workers increases, additional workers have to share 
equipment and work in more crowded conditions. Eventually, the kitchen is so 
crowded that the workers start getting in each other’s way. Hence, as more and 
more workers are hired, each additional worker contributes fewer additional 
cookies to total production. 
Diminishing marginal product is also apparent in Figure 2. The production 
function’s slope (“rise over run”) tells us the change in Caroline’s output of cook-
ies (“rise”) for each additional input of labor (“run”). That is, the slope of the 
production function measures the marginal product of a worker. As the number 
of workers increases, the marginal product declines, and the production function 
becomes flatter.
From the Production Function to the Total-Cost Curve
The last three columns of Table 1 show Caroline’s cost of producing cookies. 
In this example, the cost of Caroline’s factory is $30 per hour, and the cost of a 
worker is $10 per hour. If she hires 1 worker, her total cost is $40 per hour. If she 
hires 2 workers, her total cost is $50 per hour, and so on. With this information, 
the table now shows how the number of workers Caroline hires is related to the 
quantity of cookies she produces and to her total cost of production.
Our goal in the next several chapters is to study firms’ production and pricing 
decisions. For this purpose, the most important relationship in Table 1 is between 
quantity produced (in the second column) and total costs (in the sixth column). 
Panel (b) of Figure 2 graphs these two columns of data with the quantity pro-
duced on the horizontal axis and total cost on the vertical axis. This graph is called 
the total-cost curve.
Now compare the total-cost curve in panel (b) with the production function in 
panel (a). These two curves are opposite sides of the same coin. The total-cost curve 
gets steeper as the amount produced rises, whereas the production function gets 
flatter as production rises. These changes in slope occur for the same reason. High 
production of cookies means that Caroline’s kitchen is crowded with many work-
ers. Because the kitchen is crowded, each additional worker adds less to production, 
reflecting diminishing marginal product. Therefore, the production function is rela-
tively flat. But now turn this logic around: When the kitchen is crowded, produc-
ing an additional cookie requires a lot of additional labor and is thus very costly. 
Therefore, when the quantity produced is large, the total-cost curve is relatively steep.
Quick Quiz  If Farmer Jones plants no seeds on his farm, he gets no harvest. If he 
plants 1 bag of seeds, he gets 3 bushels of wheat. If he plants 2 bags, he gets 5 bushels. 
If he plants 3 bags, he gets 6 bushels. A bag of seeds costs $100, and seeds are his only 
cost. Use these data to graph the farmer’s production function and total-cost curve. 
Explain their shapes. 
The Various Measures of Cost
Our analysis of Caroline’s Cookie Factory demonstrated how a firm’s total cost 
reflects its production function. From data on a firm’s total cost, we can derive 
several related measures of cost, which will turn out to be useful when we ­analyze 
diminishing 
marginal product
the property whereby 
the marginal product of 
an input declines as the 
quantity of the input 
increases

production and pricing decisions in future chapters. To see how these related 
measures are derived, we consider the example in Table 2. This table presents cost 
data on Caroline’s neighbor—Conrad’s Coffee Shop.
The first column of the table shows the number of cups of coffee that Conrad 
might produce, ranging from 0 to 10 cups per hour. The second column shows 
Conrad’s total cost of producing coffee. Figure 3 plots Conrad’s total-cost curve. 
The quantity of coffee (from the first column) is on the horizontal axis, and total 
cost (from the second column) is on the vertical axis. Conrad’s total-cost curve has 
a shape similar to Caroline’s. In particular, it becomes steeper as the quantity pro-
duced rises, which (as we have discussed) reflects diminishing marginal product.
Fixed and Variable Costs
Conrad’s total cost can be divided into two types. Some costs, called fixed costs, do 
not vary with the quantity of output produced. They are incurred even if the firm 
produces nothing at all. Conrad’s fixed costs include any rent he pays because this 
cost is the same regardless of how much coffee he produces. Similarly, if Conrad 
needs to hire a full-time bookkeeper to pay bills, regardless of the quantity of cof-
fee produced, the bookkeeper’s salary is a fixed cost. The third column in Table 2 
shows Conrad’s fixed cost, which in this example is $3.00.
Some of the firm’s costs, called variable costs, change as the firm alters the 
quantity of output produced. Conrad’s variable costs include the cost of coffee 
fixed costs
costs that do not vary 
with the quantity of 
output produced
variable costs
costs that vary with 
the quantity of output

beans, milk, sugar, and paper cups: The more cups of coffee Conrad makes, the 
more of these items he needs to buy. Similarly, if Conrad has to hire more workers 
to make more cups of coffee, the salaries of these workers are variable costs. The 
fourth column of the table shows Conrad’s variable cost. The variable cost is 0 if 
he produces nothing, $0.30 if he produces 1 cup of coffee, $0.80 if he produces 2 
cups, and so on.
A firm’s total cost is the sum of fixed and variable costs. In Table 2, total cost 
in the second column equals fixed cost in the third column plus variable cost in 
the fourth column.
Average and Marginal Cost
As the owner of his firm, Conrad has to decide how much to produce. A key part 
of this decision is how his costs will vary as he changes the level of production. In 
making this decision, Conrad might ask his production supervisor the following 
two questions about the cost of producing coffee:
• 	 How much does it cost to make the typical cup of coffee?
• 	 How much does it cost to increase production of coffee by 1 cup?
Although at first these two questions might seem to have the same answer, they 
do not. Both answers will turn out to be important for understanding how firms 
make production decisions.
To find the cost of the typical unit produced, we would divide the firm’s costs 
by the quantity of output it produces. For example, if the firm produces 2 cups 
of coffee per hour, its total cost is $3.80, and the cost of the typical cup is $3.80/2, 
or $1.90. Total cost divided by the quantity of output is called average total cost. 
Because total cost is the sum of fixed and variable costs, average total cost can be

expressed as the sum of average fixed cost and average variable cost. Average 
fixed cost is the fixed cost divided by the quantity of output, and average variable 
cost is the variable cost divided by the quantity of output.
Average total cost tells us the cost of the typical unit, but it does not tell us 
how much total cost will change as the firm alters its level of production. The last 
column in Table 2 shows the amount that total cost rises when the firm increases 
production by 1 unit of output. This number is called marginal cost. For example, 
if Conrad increases production from 2 to 3 cups, total cost rises from $3.80 to $4.50, 
so the marginal cost of the third cup of coffee is $4.50 minus $3.80, or $0.70. In the 
table, the marginal cost appears halfway between two rows because it represents 
the change in total cost as quantity of output increases from one level to another.
It may be helpful to express these definitions mathematically:
Average total cost = Total cost/Quantity
ATC = TC/Q
and
Marginal cost = Change in total cost/Change in quantity
MC = ∆TC/∆Q.
Here ∆, the Greek letter delta, represents the change in a variable. These equa-
tions show how average total cost and marginal cost are derived from total cost. 
Average total cost tells us the cost of a typical unit of output if total cost is divided evenly 
over all the units produced. Marginal cost tells us the increase in total cost that arises from 
producing an additional unit of output. As we will see more fully in the next chapter, 
business managers like Conrad need to keep in mind the concepts of average total 
cost and marginal cost when deciding how much of their product to supply to the 
market. 
Cost Curves and Their Shapes
Just as in previous chapters we found graphs of supply and demand useful when 
analyzing the behavior of markets, we will find graphs of average and marginal 
cost useful when analyzing the behavior of firms. Figure 4 graphs Conrad’s costs 
using the data from Table 2. The horizontal axis measures the quantity the firm 
produces, and the vertical axis measures marginal and average costs. The graph 
shows four curves: average total cost (ATC), average fixed cost (AFC), average 
variable cost (AVC), and marginal cost (MC). 
The cost curves shown here for Conrad’s Coffee Shop have some features 
that are common to the cost curves of many firms in the economy. Let’s examine 
three features in particular: the shape of the marginal-cost curve, the shape of the 
average-total-cost curve, and the relationship between marginal and average total 
cost. 
Rising Marginal Cost  Conrad’s marginal cost rises with the quantity of out-
put produced. This reflects the property of diminishing marginal product. When 
Conrad produces a small quantity of coffee, he has few workers, and much of his 
equipment is not used. Because he can easily put these idle resources to use, the 
marginal product of an extra worker is large, and the marginal cost of an extra cup 
of coffee is small. By contrast, when Conrad produces a large quantity of coffee,

This figure shows the average

for Conrad’s Coffee Shop. All 
of these curves are obtained by 
graphing the data in Table 2. 
These cost curves show three 
features that are typical of many 
firms: (1) Marginal cost rises 
with the quantity of output. (2) 
The average-total-cost curve is 
U-shaped. (3) The marginal-cost 
curve crosses the average-total-

average total cost.

his shop is crowded with workers, and most of his equipment is fully utilized. 
Conrad can produce more coffee by adding workers, but these new workers 
have to work in crowded conditions and may have to wait to use the equipment. 
Therefore, when the quantity of coffee produced is already high, the marginal 
product of an extra worker is low, and the marginal cost of an extra cup of coffee 
is large.
U-Shaped Average Total Cost  Conrad’s average-total-cost curve is U-shaped, 
as shown in Figure 4. To understand why, remember that average total cost is the 
sum of average fixed cost and average variable cost. Average fixed cost always 
declines as output rises because the fixed cost is spread over a larger number of 
units. Average variable cost typically rises as output increases because of dimin-
ishing marginal product. 
Average total cost reflects the shapes of both average fixed cost and average 
variable cost. At very low levels of output, such as 1 or 2 cups per hour, average 
total cost is very high. Even though average variable cost is low, average fixed cost 
is high because the fixed cost is spread over only a few units. As output increases, 
the fixed cost is spread more widely. Average fixed cost declines, rapidly at first 
and then more slowly. As a result, average total cost also declines until the firm’s 
output reaches 5 cups of coffee per hour, when average total cost is $1.30 per cup. 
When the firm produces more than 6 cups per hour, however, the increase in aver-
age variable cost becomes the dominant force, and average total cost starts rising. 
The tug of war between average fixed cost and average variable cost generates the 
U-shape in average total cost.

## Page 270

The bottom of the U-shape occurs at the quantity that minimizes average total 
cost. This quantity is sometimes called the efficient scale of the firm. For Conrad, 
the efficient scale is 5 or 6 cups of coffee per hour. If he produces more or less than 
this amount, his average total cost rises above the minimum of $1.30. At lower 
levels of output, average total cost is higher than $1.30 because the fixed cost is 
spread over so few units. At higher levels of output, average total cost is higher 
than $1.30 because the marginal product of inputs has diminished significantly. 
At the efficient scale, these two forces are balanced to yield the lowest average 
total cost.
The Relationship between Marginal Cost and Average Total Cost  If 
you look at Figure 4 (or back at Table 2), you will see something that may be sur-
prising at first. Whenever marginal cost is less than average total cost, average total cost 
is falling. Whenever marginal cost is greater than average total cost, average total cost is 
rising. This feature of Conrad’s cost curves is not a coincidence from the particular 
numbers used in the example: It is true for all firms.
To see why, consider an analogy. Average total cost is like your cumulative 
grade point average. Marginal cost is like the grade in the next course you will 
take. If your grade in your next course is less than your grade point average, your 
grade point average will fall. If your grade in your next course is higher than 
your grade point average, your grade point average will rise. The mathematics 
of average and marginal costs is exactly the same as the mathematics of average 
and marginal grades.
This relationship between average total cost and marginal cost has an impor-
tant corollary: The marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at its mini-
mum. Why? At low levels of output, marginal cost is below average total cost, so 
average total cost is falling. But after the two curves cross, marginal cost rises 
above average total cost. For the reason we have just discussed, average total 
cost must start to rise at this level of output. Hence, this point of intersection is 
the minimum of average total cost. As you will see in the next chapter, minimum 
average total cost plays a key role in the analysis of competitive firms.
Typical Cost Curves
In the examples we have studied so far, the firms exhibit diminishing marginal 
product and, therefore, rising marginal cost at all levels of output. This simplify-
ing assumption was useful because it allowed us to focus on the key features of 
cost curves that will prove useful in analyzing firm behavior. Yet actual firms 
are usually more complicated than this. In many firms, marginal product does 
not start to fall immediately after the first worker is hired. Depending on the 
production process, the second or third worker might have a higher marginal 
product than the first because a team of workers can divide tasks and work 
more productively than a single worker. Firms exhibiting this pattern would 
experience increasing marginal product for a while before diminishing marginal 
product set in. 
Figure 5 shows the cost curves for such a firm, including average total cost 
(ATC), average fixed cost (AFC), average variable cost (AVC), and marginal cost 
(MC). At low levels of output, the firm experiences increasing marginal prod-
uct, and the marginal-cost curve falls. Eventually, the firm starts to experience 
diminishing marginal product, and the marginal-cost curve starts to rise. This 
combination of increasing then diminishing marginal product also makes the 
average-variable-cost curve U-shaped.

Despite these differences from our previous example, the cost curves shown 
here share the three properties that are most important to remember:
• 	 Marginal cost eventually rises with the quantity of output. 
• 	 The average-total-cost curve is U-shaped.
• 	 The marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at the minimum 
of average total cost. 
Quick Quiz  Suppose Honda’s total cost of producing 4 cars is $225,000 and its total 
cost of producing 5 cars is $250,000. What is the average total cost of producing 5 cars? 
What is the marginal cost of the fifth car? • Draw the marginal-cost curve and the aver-
age-total-cost curve for a typical firm, and explain why these curves cross where they do.
Costs in the Short Run and in the Long Run
We noted earlier in this chapter that a firm’s costs might depend on the time hori-
zon under consideration. Let’s examine more precisely why this might be the case.
The Relationship between Short-Run and  
Long-Run Average Total Cost 
For many firms, the division of total costs between fixed and variable costs 
depends on the time horizon. Consider, for instance, a car manufacturer such as 
Ford Motor Company. Over a period of only a few months, Ford cannot adjust the 
number or size of its car factories. The only way it can produce additional cars is 
to hire more workers at the factories it already has. The cost of these factories is, 
therefore, a fixed cost in the short run. By contrast, over a period of several years, 
Ford can expand the size of its factories, build new factories, or close old ones. 
Thus, the cost of its factories is a variable cost in the long run.

## Page 272

Because many decisions are fixed in the short run but variable in the long run, 
a firm’s long-run cost curves differ from its short-run cost curves. Figure 6 shows 
an example. The figure presents three short-run average-total-cost curves—for a 
small, medium, and large factory. It also presents the long-run average-total-cost 
curve. As the firm moves along the long-run curve, it is adjusting the size of the 
factory to the quantity of production.
This graph shows how short-run and long-run costs are related. The long-run 
average-total-cost curve is a much flatter U-shape than the short-run average-total-
cost curve. In addition, all the short-run curves lie on or above the long-run curve. 
These properties arise because firms have greater flexibility in the long run. In 
essence, in the long run, the firm gets to choose which short-run curve it wants to use. 
But in the short run, it has to use whatever short-run curve it has chosen in the past.
The figure shows an example of how a change in production alters costs over dif-
ferent time horizons. When Ford wants to increase production from 1,000 to 1,200 
cars per day, it has no choice in the short run but to hire more workers at its existing 
medium-sized factory. Because of diminishing marginal product, average total cost 
rises from $10,000 to $12,000 per car. In the long run, however, Ford can expand both 
the size of the factory and its workforce, and average total cost returns to $10,000. 
How long does it take a firm to get to the long run? The answer depends on 
the firm. It can take a year or more for a major manufacturing firm, such as a car 
company, to build a larger factory. By contrast, a person running a coffee shop can 
buy another coffee maker within a few days. There is, therefore, no single answer 
to how long it takes a firm to adjust its production facilities.
Economies and Diseconomies of Scale
The shape of the long-run average-total-cost curve conveys important informa-
tion about the production processes that a firm has available for manufacturing a 
good. In particular, it tells us how costs vary with the scale—that is, the size—of a 
firm’s operations. When long-run average total cost declines as output increases, 
there are said to be economies of scale. When long-run average total cost rises 
as output increases, there are said to be diseconomies of scale. When long-run

­average total cost does not vary with the level of output, there are said to be 
­constant returns to scale. In this example, Ford has economies of scale at low 
levels of output, constant returns to scale at intermediate levels of output, and 
diseconomies of scale at high levels of output. 
What might cause economies or diseconomies of scale? Economies of scale 
often arise because higher production levels allow specialization among workers, 
which permits each worker to become better at a specific task. For instance, if 
Ford hires a large number of workers and produces a large number of cars, it can 
reduce costs with modern assembly-line production. Diseconomies of scale can 
arise because of coordination problems that are inherent in any large organization. 
The more cars Ford produces, the more stretched the management team becomes, 
and the less effective the managers become at keeping costs down. 
This analysis shows why long-run average-total-cost curves are often U-shaped. 
At low levels of production, the firm benefits from increased size because it can 
take advantage of greater specialization. Coordination problems, meanwhile, are 
not yet acute. By contrast, at high levels of production, the benefits of specializa-
tion have already been realized, and coordination problems become more severe 
as the firm grows larger. Thus, long-run average total cost is falling at low levels 
of production because of increasing specialization and rising at high levels of pro-
duction because of increasing coordination problems.
Quick Quiz  If Boeing produces 9 jets per month, its long-run total cost is $9.0 mil-
lion per month. If it produces 10 jets per month, its long-run total cost is $9.5 million 
per month. Does Boeing exhibit economies or diseconomies of scale?

FYI
 Lessons from a Pin Factory
“Jack of all trades, master of none.” This well-known adage helps 
explain why firms sometimes experience economies of scale. A per-
son who tries to do everything usually ends up doing nothing very 
well. If a firm wants its workers to be as productive as they can be, 
it is often best to give each worker a limited task that he or she can 
master. But this is possible only if a firm employs many workers and 
produces a large quantity of output.
	
In his celebrated book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of 
the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith described a visit he made to a 
pin factory. Smith was impressed by the specialization among the 
workers and the resulting economies of scale. He wrote,
One man draws out the wire, another straightens it, a third 
cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiv-
ing the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct 
operations; to put it on is a peculiar business; to whiten it is 
another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into paper.
	
Smith reported that because of this specialization, the pin factory 
produced thousands of pins per worker every day. He conjectured 
that if the workers had chosen to work separately, rather than as 
a team of specialists, “they certainly could not each of them make 
twenty, perhaps not one pin a day.” In other words, because of 
specialization, a large pin factory could achieve higher output per 
worker and lower average cost per pin than a small pin factory.
	
The specialization that Smith observed in the pin factory is 
prevalent in the modern economy. If you want to build a house, for 
instance, you could try to do all the work yourself. But most people 
turn to a builder, who in turn hires carpenters, plumbers, electri-
cians, painters, and many other types of workers. These workers 
specialize in particular jobs, and this allows them to become better 
at their jobs than if they were generalists. Indeed, the use of special-
ization to achieve economies of scale is one reason modern societies 
are as prosperous as they are.

Conclusion
The purpose of this chapter has been to develop some tools to study how firms 
make production and pricing decisions. You should now understand what econo-
mists mean by the term costs and how costs vary with the quantity of output a 
firm produces. To refresh your memory, Table 3 summarizes some of the defini-
tions we have encountered. 
By themselves, a firm’s cost curves do not tell us what decisions the firm will 
make. But they are a key component of that decision, as we will see in the next 
chapter.

The Many Types of Cost: 
A Summary
Table 3
• The goal of firms is to maximize profit, which 
equals total revenue minus total cost. 
• When analyzing a firm’s behavior, it is impor-
tant to include all the opportunity costs of pro-
duction. Some of the opportunity costs, such as 
the wages a firm pays its workers, are explicit. 
Other opportunity costs, such as the wages the 
firm owner gives up by working in the firm 
rather than taking another job, are implicit. 
Economic profit takes both explicit and implicit 
costs into account, whereas accounting profits 
considers only explicit costs.
• A firm’s costs reflect its production process. A 
typical firm’s production function gets flatter 
as the quantity of an input increases, displaying 
the property of diminishing marginal product. 
As a result, a firm’s total-cost curve gets steeper 
as the quantity produced rises.

opportunity cost, total cost, fixed cost, variable 
cost, average total cost, and marginal cost. Fill in 
the type of cost that best completes each sentence:
a.	 What you give up for taking some action is 
called the ______.
b.	_____ is falling when marginal cost is below 
it and rising when marginal cost is above it.
c.	 A cost that does not depend on the quantity

d.	In the ice-cream industry in the short run, 
______ includes the cost of cream and sugar 
but not the cost of the factory.
e.	 Profits equal total revenue less ______.
f.	 The cost of producing an extra unit of output 
is the ______.
• A firm’s total costs can be divided between fixed 
costs and variable costs. Fixed costs are costs that 
do not change when the firm alters the quantity 
of output produced. Variable costs are costs that 
change when the firm alters the quantity of out-
put produced. 
• From a firm’s total cost, two related measures of 
cost are derived. Average total cost is total cost 
divided by the quantity of output. Marginal cost 
is the amount by which total cost rises if output 
increases by 1 unit.
• When analyzing firm behavior, it is often useful 
to graph average total cost and marginal cost. For 
a typical firm, marginal cost rises with the quan-
tity of output. Average total cost first falls as out-
put increases and then rises as output increases 
further. The marginal-cost curve always crosses 
the average-total-cost curve at the minimum of 
average total cost. 
• A firm’s costs often depend on the time horizon 
considered. In particular, many costs are fixed in 
the short run but variable in the long run. As a 
result, when the firm changes its level of produc-
tion, average total cost may rise more in the short 
run than in the long run.

	 2.	 Your aunt is thinking about opening a 
hardware store. She estimates that it would 
cost $500,000 per year to rent the location and 
buy the stock. In addition, she would have to 
quit her $50,000 per year job as an accountant.
a.	 Define opportunity cost.
b.	What is your aunt’s opportunity cost of  
running a hardware store for a year? If your 
aunt thought she could sell $510,000 worth 
of merchandise in a year, should she open 
the store? Explain.

a.	 Fill in the column of marginal products. 
What pattern do you see? How might you 
explain it?
b.	A worker costs $100 a day, and the firm has 
fixed costs of $200. Use this information to 
fill in the column for total cost.
c.	 Fill in the column for average total cost. 
(Recall that ATC = TC/Q.) What pattern do 
you see? 
d.	Now fill in the column for marginal cost. 
(Recall that MC = ∆TC/∆Q.) What pattern do 
you see? 
e.	 Compare the column for marginal product 
and the column for marginal cost. Explain 
the relationship.
f.	 Compare the column for average total cost 
and the column for marginal cost. Explain 
the relationship.
	 5.	 You are the chief financial officer for a firm that 
sells digital music players. Your firm has the 
following average-total-cost schedule:
Quantity	
Average Total Cost
600 players	
$300	
601	
  301
	 	 Your current level of production is 600 devices, 
all of which have been sold. Someone calls, 
desperate to buy one of your music players. 
The caller offers you $550 for it. Should you 
accept the offer? Why or why not?

	 7.	 You are thinking about setting up a lemonade 
stand. The stand itself costs $200. The 
ingredients for each cup of lemonade cost $0.50.
a.	 What is your fixed cost of doing business? 
What is your variable cost per cup? 
b.	Construct a table showing your total cost, 
average total cost, and marginal cost for 
output levels varying from 0 to 10 gallons. 
(Hint: There are 16 cups in a gallon.) Draw 
the three cost curves.
	 8.	 Your cousin Vinnie owns a painting company 
with fixed costs of $200 and the following 
schedule for variable costs:
Quantity of

per Month
Variable Costs	
$10	 $20	 $40	 $80	 $160	 $320	 $640
	 	 Calculate average fixed cost, average variable cost, 
and average total cost for each quantity. What is 
the efficient scale of the painting company?
	 9.	 A firm uses two inputs in production: capital and 
labor. In the short run, the firm cannot adjust the 
amount of capital it is using, but it can adjust the 
size of its workforce. What happens to the firm’s 
average total cost curve, the average variable cost 
curve, and the marginal cost curve when
a.	 the cost of renting capital increases?
b.	the cost of hiring labor increases?
	10.	 The city government is considering two tax 
proposals: 
• A lump-sum tax of $300 on each producer of 
hamburgers. 
• A tax of $1 per burger, paid by producers of 
hamburgers. 
a.	 Which of the following curves—average 
fixed cost, average variable cost, average total 
cost, and marginal cost—would shift as a 
result of the lump-sum tax? Why? Show this 
in a graph. Label the graph as precisely as 
possible. 
b.	Which of these same four curves would 
shift as a result of the per-burger tax? Why? 
Show this in a new graph. Label the graph as 
precisely as possible.
