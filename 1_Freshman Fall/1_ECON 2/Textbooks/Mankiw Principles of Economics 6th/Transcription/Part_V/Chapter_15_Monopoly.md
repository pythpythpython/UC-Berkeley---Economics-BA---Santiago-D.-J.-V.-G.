Monopoly
I
f you own a personal computer, it probably uses some version of Windows, 
the operating system sold by the Microsoft Corporation. When Microsoft first 
designed Windows many years ago, it applied for and received a copyright 
from the government. The copyright gives Microsoft the exclusive right to 
make and sell copies of the Windows operating system. If a person wants to buy 
a copy of Windows, he or she has little choice but to give Microsoft the approxi-
mately $100 that the firm has decided to charge for its product. Microsoft is said 
to have a monopoly in the market for Windows.
Microsoft’s business decisions are not well described by the model of firm 
behavior we developed in the previous chapter. In that chapter, we analyzed 
competitive markets, in which there are many firms offering essentially identical 
products, so each firm has little influence over the price it receives. By contrast, 
a monopoly such as Microsoft has no close competitors and, therefore, has the 
power to influence the market price of its product. While a competitive firm is a 
price taker, a monopoly firm is a price maker.

In this chapter, we examine the implications of this market power. We will see 
that market power alters the relationship between a firm’s costs and the price at 
which it sells its product. A competitive firm takes the price of its output as given 
by the market and then chooses the quantity it will supply so that price equals 
marginal cost. By contrast, a monopoly charges a price that exceeds marginal cost. 
This result is clearly true in the case of Microsoft’s Windows. The marginal cost of 
Windows—the extra cost that Microsoft incurs by printing one more copy of the 
program onto a CD—is only a few dollars. The market price of Windows is many 
times its marginal cost.
It is not surprising that monopolies charge high prices for their products. 
Customers of monopolies might seem to have little choice but to pay whatever 
the monopoly charges. But if so, why does a copy of Windows not cost $1,000? 
Or $10,000? The reason is that if Microsoft sets the price that high, fewer people 
would buy the product. People would buy fewer computers, switch to other oper-
ating systems, or make illegal copies. A monopoly firm can control the price of the 
good it sells, but because a high price reduces the quantity that its customers buy, 
the monopoly’s profits are not unlimited.
As we examine the production and pricing decisions of monopolies, we also 
consider the implications of monopoly for society as a whole. Monopoly firms, 
like competitive firms, aim to maximize profit. But this goal has very different 
ramifications for competitive and monopoly firms. In competitive markets, self-
interested consumers and producers behave as if they are guided by an invisible 
hand to promote general economic well-being. By contrast, because monopoly 
firms are unchecked by competition, the outcome in a market with a monopoly is 
often not in the best interest of society.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that governments can 
sometimes improve market outcomes. The analysis in this chapter sheds more 
light on this principle. As we examine the problems that monopolies raise for 
society, we discuss the various ways in which government policymakers might 
respond to these problems. The U.S. government, for example, keeps a close 
eye on Microsoft’s business decisions. In 1994, it blocked Microsoft from buying 
Intuit, a leading seller of personal finance software, on the grounds that combin-
ing the two firms would concentrate too much market power. Similarly, in 1998, 
the U.S. Department of Justice objected when Microsoft started integrating its 
Internet browser into its Windows operating system, claiming that this addition 
would extend the firm’s market power into new areas. To this day, Microsoft 
continues to wrangle with antitrust regulators in the United States and abroad.
Why Monopolies Arise
A firm is a monopoly if it is the sole seller of its product and if its product does 
not have close substitutes. The fundamental cause of monopoly is barriers to entry: 
A monopoly remains the only seller in its market because other firms cannot 
enter the market and compete with it. Barriers to entry, in turn, have three main 
sources:
• 	 Monopoly resources: A key resource required for production is owned by a 
single firm.
• 	 Government regulation: The government gives a single firm the exclusive 
right to produce some good or service.

• 	 The production process: A single firm can produce output at a lower cost than 
can a larger number of producers.
Let’s briefly discuss each of these.
Monopoly Resources
The simplest way for a monopoly to arise is for a single firm to own a key 
resource. For example, consider the market for water in a small town in the Old 
West. If dozens of town residents have working wells, the competitive model 
discussed in the preceding chapter describes the behavior of sellers. As a result of 
the competition among water suppliers, the price of a gallon is driven to equal the 
marginal cost of pumping an extra gallon. But if there is only one well in town and 
it is impossible to get water from anywhere else, then the owner of the well has 
a monopoly on water. Not surprisingly, the monopolist has much greater market 
power than any single firm in a competitive market. In the case of a necessity like 
water, the monopolist could command quite a high price, even if the marginal cost 
of pumping an extra gallon is low.
A classic example of market power arising from the ownership of a key 
resource is DeBeers, the South African diamond company. Founded in 1888 by 
Cecil Rhodes, an English businessman (and benefactor for the Rhodes scholar-
ship), DeBeers has at times controlled up to 80 percent of the production from the 
world’s diamond mines. Because its market share is less than 100 percent, DeBeers 
is not exactly a monopoly, but the company has nonetheless exerted substantial 
influence over the market price of diamonds.
Although exclusive ownership of a key resource is a potential cause of mono­
poly, in practice monopolies rarely arise for this reason. Economies are large, and 
resources are owned by many people. Indeed, because many goods are traded 
internationally, the natural scope of their markets is often worldwide. There are, 
therefore, few examples of firms that own a resource for which there are no close 
substitutes.
Government-Created Monopolies
In many cases, monopolies arise because the government has given one person 
or firm the exclusive right to sell some good or service. Sometimes the monopoly 
arises from the sheer political clout of the would-be monopolist. Kings, for exam-
ple, once granted exclusive business licenses to their friends and allies. At other 
times, the government grants a monopoly because doing so is viewed to be in the 
public interest.
The patent and copyright laws are two important examples. When a pharmaceu-
tical company discovers a new drug, it can apply to the government for a ­patent. If 
the government deems the drug to be truly original, it approves the patent, which 
gives the company the exclusive right to manufacture and sell the drug for twenty 
years. Similarly, when a novelist finishes a book, she can copyright it. The copy-
right is a government guarantee that no one can print and sell the work without 
the author’s permission. The copyright makes the novelist a monopolist in the sale 
of her novel.
The effects of patent and copyright laws are easy to see. Because these laws 
give one producer a monopoly, they lead to higher prices than would occur 
under competition. But by allowing these monopoly producers to charge higher 
prices and earn higher profits, the laws also encourage some desirable behavior. 
“Rather than a monopoly,
we like to consider
ourselves ‘the only game
in town.’ ”

Drug companies are allowed to be monopolists in the drugs they discover to 
encourage research. Authors are allowed to be monopolists in the sale of their 
books to encourage them to write more and better books.
Thus, the laws governing patents and copyrights have benefits and costs. The 
benefits of the patent and copyright laws are the increased incentives for creative 
activity. These benefits are offset, to some extent, by the costs of monopoly pric-
ing, which we examine fully later in this chapter. 
Natural Monopolies
An industry is a natural monopoly when a single firm can supply a good or ser­
vice to an entire market at a lower cost than could two or more firms. A natural 
monopoly arises when there are economies of scale over the relevant range of 
output. Figure 1 shows the average total costs of a firm with economies of scale. 
In this case, a single firm can produce any amount of output at least cost. That is, 
for any given amount of output, a larger number of firms leads to less output per 
firm and higher average total cost.
An example of a natural monopoly is the distribution of water. To provide 
water to residents of a town, a firm must build a network of pipes throughout the 
town. If two or more firms were to compete in the provision of this service, each 
firm would have to pay the fixed cost of building a network. Thus, the average 
total cost of water is lowest if a single firm serves the entire market. 
We saw other examples of natural monopolies when we discussed public 
goods and common resources in Chapter 11. We noted that club goods are exclud-
able but not rival in consumption. An example is a bridge used so infrequently 
that it is never congested. The bridge is excludable because a toll collector can 
prevent someone from using it. The bridge is not rival in consumption because 
use of the bridge by one person does not diminish the ability of others to use it. 
Because there is a fixed cost of building the bridge and a negligible marginal cost 
of additional users, the average total cost of a trip across the bridge (the total 
cost divided by the number of trips) falls as the number of trips rises. Hence, the 
bridge is a natural monopoly.
When a firm is a natural monopoly, it is less concerned about new entrants erod-
ing its monopoly power. Normally, a firm has trouble maintaining a monopoly

Economies of Scale as a Cause of Monopoly
When a firm’s average-total-cost curve continually 
declines, the firm has what is called a natural monopoly. 
In this case, when production is divided among more 
firms, each firm produces less, and average total cost rises. 
As a result, a single firm can produce any given amount at 
the smallest cost.

position without ownership of a key resource or protection from the government. 
The monopolist’s profit attracts entrants into the market, and these entrants make 
the market more competitive. By contrast, entering a market in which another firm 
has a natural monopoly is unattractive. Would-be entrants know that they cannot 
achieve the same low costs that the monopolist enjoys because, after entry, each 
firm would have a smaller piece of the market. 
In some cases, the size of the market is one determinant of whether an industry 
is a natural monopoly. Again, consider a bridge across a river. When the popula-
tion is small, the bridge may be a natural monopoly. A single bridge can satisfy 
the entire demand for trips across the river at lowest cost. Yet as the population 
grows and the bridge becomes congested, satisfying the entire demand may 
require two or more bridges across the same river. Thus, as a market expands, a 
natural monopoly can evolve into a more competitive market.
Quick Quiz  What are the three reasons that a market might have a monopoly? 
• Give two examples of monopolies and explain the reason for each.
How Monopolies Make Production and Pricing Decisions
Now that we know how monopolies arise, we can consider how a monopoly firm 
decides how much of its product to make and what price to charge for it. The 
analysis of monopoly behavior in this section is the starting point for evaluating 
whether monopolies are desirable and what policies the government might pur-
sue in monopoly markets. 
Monopoly versus Competition
The key difference between a competitive firm and a monopoly is the monopoly’s 
ability to influence the price of its output. A competitive firm is small relative to 
the market in which it operates and, therefore, has no power to influence the price 
of its output. It takes the price as given by market conditions. By contrast, because 
a monopoly is the sole producer in its market, it can alter the price of its good by 
adjusting the quantity it supplies to the market.
One way to view this difference between a competitive firm and a monopoly 
is to consider the demand curve that each firm faces. When we analyzed profit 
maximization by competitive firms in the preceding chapter, we drew the market 
price as a horizontal line. Because a competitive firm can sell as much or as little 
as it wants at this price, the competitive firm faces a horizontal demand curve, 
as in panel (a) of Figure 2. In effect, because the competitive firm sells a product 
with many perfect substitutes (the products of all the other firms in its market), 
the demand curve that any one firm faces is perfectly elastic.
By contrast, because a monopoly is the sole producer in its market, its demand 
curve is the market demand curve. Thus, the monopolist’s demand curve slopes 
downward for all the usual reasons, as in panel (b) of Figure 2. If the monopolist 
raises the price of its good, consumers buy less of it. Looked at another way, if 
the monopolist reduces the quantity of output it produces and sells, the price of 
its output increases.
The market demand curve provides a constraint on a monopoly’s ability to 
profit from its market power. A monopolist would prefer, if it were possible, 
to charge a high price and sell a large quantity at that high price. The market

demand curve makes that outcome impossible. In particular, the market demand 
curve describes the combinations of price and quantity that are available to a 
monopoly firm. By adjusting the quantity produced (or equivalently, the price 
charged), the monopolist can choose any point on the demand curve, but it cannot 
choose a point off the demand curve. 
What price and quantity of output will the monopolist choose? As with com-
petitive firms, we assume that the monopolist’s goal is to maximize profit. Because 
the firm’s profit is total revenue minus total costs, our next task in explaining 
monopoly behavior is to examine a monopolist’s revenue.
A Monopoly’s Revenue
Consider a town with a single producer of water. Table 1 shows how the mono­
poly’s revenue might depend on the amount of water produced. 
The first two columns show the monopolist’s demand schedule. If the mono­
polist produces 1 gallon of water, it can sell that gallon for $10. If it produces 2 
gallons, it must lower the price to $9 to sell both gallons. If it produces 3 gallons, 
it must lower the price to $8. And so on. If you graphed these two columns of 
numbers, you would get a typical downward-sloping demand curve.
The third column of the table presents the monopolist’s total revenue. It equals the 
quantity sold (from the first column) times the price (from the second column). The 
fourth column computes the firm’s average revenue, the amount of revenue the firm 
receives per unit sold. We compute average revenue by taking the number for total 
revenue in the third column and dividing it by the quantity of output in the first 
column. As we discussed in the previous chapter, average revenue always equals 
the price of the good. This is true for monopolists as well as for competitive firms.
The last column of Table 1 computes the firm’s marginal revenue, the amount 
of revenue that the firm receives for each additional unit of output. We compute 
Figure 2
Demand Curves for 
Competitive and Monopoly 
Firms
Because competitive firms are price takers, they in effect face horizontal demand 
curves, as in panel (a). Because a monopoly firm is the sole producer in its market, it 
faces the downward-sloping market demand curve, as in panel (b). As a result, the 
monopoly has to accept a lower price if it wants to sell more output.

marginal revenue by taking the change in total revenue when output increases 
by 1 unit. For example, when the firm is producing 3 gallons of water, it receives 
total revenue of $24. Raising production to 4 gallons increases total revenue to $28. 
Thus, marginal revenue from the sale of the fourth gallon is $28 minus $24, or $4.
Table 1 shows a result that is important for understanding monopoly behavior: 
A monopolist’s marginal revenue is always less than the price of its good. For example, 
if the firm raises production of water from 3 to 4 gallons, it will increase total 
revenue by only $4, even though it will be able to sell each gallon for $7. For 
a monopoly, marginal revenue is lower than price because a monopoly faces a 
downward-sloping demand curve. To increase the amount sold, a monopoly firm 
must lower the price it charges to all customers. Hence, to sell the fourth gallon of 
water, the monopolist will get $1 less revenue for each of the first three gallons. 
This $3 loss accounts for the difference between the price of the fourth gallon ($7) 
and the marginal revenue of that fourth gallon ($4).
Marginal revenue for monopolies is very different from marginal revenue for 
competitive firms. When a monopoly increases the amount it sells, this action has 
two effects on total revenue (P × Q):
• 	 The output effect: More output is sold, so Q is higher, which tends to increase 
total revenue.
• 	 The price effect: The price falls, so P is lower, which tends to decrease total 
revenue.
Because a competitive firm can sell all it wants at the market price, there is no 
price effect. When it increases production by 1 unit, it receives the market price for 
that unit, and it does not receive any less for the units it was already selling. That 
is, because the competitive firm is a price taker, its marginal revenue equals the 
price of its good. By contrast, when a monopoly increases production by 1 unit, it

must reduce the price it charges for every unit it sells, and this cut in price reduces 
revenue on the units it was already selling. As a result, a monopoly’s marginal 
revenue is less than its price. 
Figure 3 graphs the demand curve and the marginal-revenue curve for 
a monopoly firm. (Because the firm’s price equals its average revenue, the 
demand curve is also the average-revenue curve.) These two curves always 
start at the same point on the vertical axis because the marginal revenue of the 
first unit sold equals the price of the good. But for the reason we just discussed, 
the monopolist’s marginal revenue on all units after the first is less than the 
price of the good. Thus, a monopoly’s marginal-revenue curve lies below its 
demand curve. 
You can see in the figure (as well as in Table 1) that marginal revenue can even 
become negative. Marginal revenue is negative when the price effect on revenue is 
greater than the output effect. In this case, when the firm produces an extra unit of 
output, the price falls by enough to cause the firm’s total revenue to decline, even 
though the firm is selling more units.
Profit Maximization
Now that we have considered the revenue of a monopoly firm, we are ready to 
examine how such a firm maximizes profit. Recall from Chapter 1 that one of 
the Ten Principles of Economics is that rational people think at the margin. This 
lesson is as true for monopolists as it is for competitive firms. Here we apply 
the logic of marginal analysis to the monopolist’s decision about how much to 
produce. 
Figure 4 graphs the demand curve, the marginal-revenue curve, and the cost 
curves for a monopoly firm. All these curves should seem familiar: The demand 
and marginal-revenue curves are like those in Figure 3, and the cost curves are 
like those we encountered in the last two chapters. These curves contain all the 
Figure 3
Demand and Marginal-Revenue 
Curves for a Monopoly
The demand curve shows how the 
quantity affects the price of the good. 
The marginal-revenue curve shows how 
the firm’s revenue changes when the 
quantity increases by 1 unit. Because 
the price on all units sold must fall if 
the monopoly increases production, 
marginal revenue is always less than the 
price.

information we need to determine the level of output that a profit-maximizing 
monopolist will choose.
Suppose, first, that the firm is producing at a low level of output, such as Q1. 
In this case, marginal cost is less than marginal revenue. If the firm increased 
production by 1 unit, the additional revenue would exceed the additional costs, 
and profit would rise. Thus, when marginal cost is less than marginal revenue, the 
firm can increase profit by producing more units.
A similar argument applies at high levels of output, such as Q2. In this case, 
marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue. If the firm reduced production 
by 1 unit, the costs saved would exceed the revenue lost. Thus, if marginal cost is 
greater than marginal revenue, the firm can raise profit by reducing production.
In the end, the firm adjusts its level of production until the quantity reaches 
QMAX, at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Thus, the monopolist’s profit-
maximizing quantity of output is determined by the intersection of the marginal-revenue 
curve and the marginal-cost curve. In Figure 4, this intersection occurs at point A.
You might recall from the previous chapter that competitive firms also choose 
the quantity of output at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In follow-
ing this rule for profit maximization, competitive firms and monopolies are alike. 
But there is also an important difference between these types of firms: The mar-
ginal revenue of a competitive firm equals its price, whereas the marginal revenue 
of a monopoly is less than its price. That is,
For a competitive firm: P = MR = MC.
	
For a monopoly firm:	
P . MR = MC.
The equality of marginal revenue and marginal cost determines the profit-­
maximizing quantity for both types of firm. What differs is how the price is related 
to marginal revenue and marginal cost.

A monopoly maximizes profit by 
choosing the quantity at which 
marginal revenue equals marginal

How does the monopoly find the profit-maximizing price for its product? 
The demand curve answers this question because the demand curve relates the 
amount that customers are willing to pay to the quantity sold. Thus, after the 
monopoly firm chooses the quantity of output that equates marginal revenue and 
marginal cost, it uses the demand curve to find the highest price it can charge for 
that quantity. In Figure 4, the profit-maximizing price is found at point B.
We can now see a key difference between markets with competitive firms and 
markets with a monopoly firm: In competitive markets, price equals marginal cost. In 
monopolized markets, price exceeds marginal cost. As we will see in a moment, this 
finding is crucial to understanding the social cost of monopoly.
A Monopoly’s Profit
How much profit does a monopoly make? To see a monopoly firm’s profit in a 
graph, recall that profit equals total revenue (TR) minus total costs (TC):
Profit = TR – TC.
We can rewrite this as
Profit = (TR/Q – TC/Q) × Q.
TR/Q is average revenue, which equals the price, P, and TC/Q is average total 
cost, ATC. Therefore,
Profit = (P –  ATC) × Q.
FYI
 Why a Monopoly Does Not Have a 
Supply Curve
Y
ou may have noticed that we have analyzed the price in a 
monopoly market using the market demand curve and the firm’s 
cost curves. We have not made any mention of the market supply 
curve. By contrast, when we analyzed prices in competitive markets 
beginning in Chapter 4, the two most important words were always 
supply and demand. 
	
What happened to the supply curve? Although monopoly 
firms make decisions about what quantity to supply (in the way 
described in this chapter), a monopoly does not have a supply 
curve. A supply curve tells us the quantity that firms choose to 
supply at any given price. This concept makes sense when we are 
analyzing competitive firms, which are price takers. But a monopoly 
firm is a price maker, not a price taker. It is not meaningful to ask 
what amount such a firm would produce at any price because the 
firm sets the price at the same time as it chooses the quantity to 
supply. 
	
Indeed, the monopolist’s decision about how much to supply is 
impossible to separate from the demand curve it faces. The shape 
of the demand curve determines the shape of the marginal-revenue 
curve, which in turn determines the monopolist’s profit-maximizing 
quantity. In a competitive market, supply decisions can be ana-
lyzed without knowing the demand curve, but that is not true in 
a monopoly market. Therefore, we never talk about a monopoly’s 
supply curve.

This equation for profit (which also holds for competitive firms) allows us to 
measure the monopolist’s profit in our graph. 
Consider the shaded box in Figure 5. The height of the box (the segment BC) 
is price minus average total cost, P – ATC, which is the profit on the typical unit 
sold. The width of the box (the segment DC) is the quantity sold, QMAX. Therefore, 
the area of this box is the monopoly firm’s total profit.
Monopoly Drugs versus Generic Drugs
According to our analysis, prices are determined differently in monopolized markets 
and competitive markets. A natural place to test this theory is the market for pharma-
ceutical drugs because this market takes on both market structures. When a firm dis-
covers a new drug, patent laws give the firm a monopoly on the sale of that drug. But 
eventually, the firm’s patent runs out, and any company can make and sell the drug. 
At that time, the market switches from being monopolistic to being competitive.
	
What should happen to the price of a drug when the patent runs out? Figure 6 
shows the market for a typical drug. In this figure, the marginal cost of produc-
ing the drug is constant. (This is approximately true for many drugs.) During the 
life of the patent, the monopoly firm maximizes profit by producing the quantity 
at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost and charging a price well above 
marginal cost. But when the patent runs out, the profit from making the drug 
should encourage new firms to enter the market. As the market becomes more 
competitive, the price should fall to equal marginal cost.
	
Experience is, in fact, consistent with our theory. When the patent on a drug 
expires, other companies quickly enter and begin selling so-called generic prod-
ucts that are chemically identical to the former monopolist’s brand-name product. 
And just as our analysis predicts, the price of the competitively produced generic 
drug is well below the price that the monopolist was charging.

The expiration of a patent, however, does not cause the monopolist to lose all 
its market power. Some consumers remain loyal to the brand-name drug, perhaps 
out of fear that the new generic drugs are not actually the same as the drug they 
have been using for years. As a result, the former monopolist can continue to 
charge a price above the price charged by its new competitors. 
	
For example, one of the most widely used antidepressants is the drug 
­fluoxetine, which is taken by millions of Americans. Because the patent on this 
drug expired in 2001, a consumer today has the choice between the original drug, 
sold under the brand name Prozac, and a generic version of the same medicine. 
Prozac sells for about three times the price of generic fluoxetine. This price dif-
ferential can persist because some consumers are not convinced that the two pills 
are perfect substitutes.  ■
Quick Quiz  Explain how a monopolist chooses the quantity of output to produce 
and the price to charge.
The Welfare Cost of Monopolies
Is monopoly a good way to organize a market? We have seen that a monopoly, 
in contrast to a competitive firm, charges a price above marginal cost. From the 
standpoint of consumers, this high price makes monopoly undesirable. At the 
same time, however, the monopoly is earning profit from charging this high price. 
From the standpoint of the owners of the firm, the high price makes monopoly 
very desirable. Is it possible that the benefits to the firm’s owners exceed the costs 
imposed on consumers, making monopoly desirable from the standpoint of society 
as a whole?
We can answer this question using the tools of welfare economics. Recall from 
Chapter 7 that total surplus measures the economic well-being of buyers and 
sellers in a market. Total surplus is the sum of consumer surplus and producer 
Figure 6
The Market for Drugs

the firm charges the monopoly

making it more competitive. As 
a result, the price falls from the

surplus. Consumer surplus is consumers’ willingness to pay for a good minus 
the amount they actually pay for it. Producer surplus is the amount producers 
receive for a good minus their costs of producing it. In this case, there is a single 
producer—the monopolist. 
You can probably guess the result of this analysis. In Chapter 7, we concluded 
that the equilibrium of supply and demand in a competitive market is not only a 
natural outcome but also a desirable one. The invisible hand of the market leads to 
an allocation of resources that makes total surplus as large as it can be. Because a 
monopoly leads to an allocation of resources different from that in a competitive 
market, the outcome must, in some way, fail to maximize total economic well-being.
The Deadweight Loss
We begin by considering what the monopoly firm would do if it were run by 
a benevolent social planner. The social planner cares not only about the profit 
earned by the firm’s owners but also about the benefits received by the firm’s 
consumers. The planner tries to maximize total surplus, which equals producer 
surplus (profit) plus consumer surplus. Keep in mind that total surplus equals the 
value of the good to consumers minus the costs of making the good incurred by 
the monopoly producer. 
Figure 7 analyzes how a benevolent social planner would choose the mono­
poly’s level of output. The demand curve reflects the value of the good to consum-
ers, as measured by their willingness to pay for it. The marginal-cost curve reflects 
the costs of the monopolist. Thus, the socially efficient quantity is found where the 
demand curve and the marginal-cost curve intersect. Below this quantity, the value of 
Figure 7
The Efficient Level of Output
A benevolent social planner who  
wanted to maximize total surplus in the 
market would choose the level of output 
where the demand curve and marginal-
cost curve intersect. Below this level, 
the value of the good to the marginal 
buyer (as reflected in the demand curve) 
exceeds the marginal cost of making the 
good. Above this level, the value to the 
marginal buyer is less than marginal cost.

an extra unit to consumers exceeds the cost of providing it, so increasing output 
would raise total surplus. Above this quantity, the cost of producing an extra unit 
exceeds the value of that unit to consumers, so decreasing output would raise 
total surplus. At the optimal quantity, the value of an extra unit to consumers 
exactly equals the marginal cost of production.
If the social planner were running the monopoly, the firm could achieve this 
efficient outcome by charging the price found at the intersection of the demand 
and marginal-cost curves. Thus, like a competitive firm and unlike a profit-
maximizing monopoly, a social planner would charge a price equal to marginal 
cost. Because this price would give consumers an accurate signal about the cost of 
producing the good, consumers would buy the efficient quantity.
We can evaluate the welfare effects of monopoly by comparing the level of out-
put that the monopolist chooses to the level of output that a social planner would 
choose. As we have seen, the monopolist chooses to produce and sell the quantity 
of output at which the marginal-revenue and marginal-cost curves intersect; the 
social planner would choose the quantity at which the demand and marginal-cost 
curves intersect. Figure 8 shows the comparison. The monopolist produces less than 
the socially efficient quantity of output. 
We can also view the inefficiency of monopoly in terms of the monopolist’s 
price. Because the market demand curve describes a negative relationship between 
the price and quantity of the good, a quantity that is inefficiently low is equiva-
lent to a price that is inefficiently high. When a monopolist charges a price above 
marginal cost, some potential consumers value the good at more than its marginal 
cost but less than the monopolist’s price. These consumers do not buy the good. 
Because the value these consumers place on the good is greater than the cost of 
providing it to them, this result is inefficient. Thus, monopoly pricing prevents 
some mutually beneficial trades from taking place. 
The inefficiency of monopoly can be measured with a deadweight loss triangle, 
as illustrated in Figure 8. Because the demand curve reflects the value to con-
sumers and the marginal-cost curve reflects the costs to the monopoly producer, 
Figure 8
The Inefficiency of Monopoly
Because a monopoly charges a 
price above marginal cost, not all 
consumers who value the good 
at more than its cost buy it. Thus, 
the quantity produced and sold by 
a monopoly is below the socially 
efficient level. The deadweight 
loss is represented by the area of 
the triangle between the demand 
curve (which reflects the value 
of the good to consumers) and 
the marginal-cost curve (which 
reflects the costs of the monopoly 
producer).

the area of the deadweight loss triangle between the demand curve and the 
marginal-cost curve equals the total surplus lost because of monopoly pricing. It 
is the reduction in economic well-being that results from the monopoly’s use of 
its market power.
The deadweight loss caused by monopoly is similar to the deadweight loss 
caused by a tax. Indeed, a monopolist is like a private tax collector. As we saw 
in Chapter 8, a tax on a good places a wedge between consumers’ willingness to 
pay (as reflected by the demand curve) and producers’ costs (as reflected by the 
supply curve). Because a monopoly exerts its market power by charging a price 
above marginal cost, it creates a similar wedge. In both cases, the wedge causes 
the quantity sold to fall short of the social optimum. The difference between the 
two cases is that the government gets the revenue from a tax, whereas a private 
firm gets the monopoly profit.
The Monopoly’s Profit: A Social Cost?
It is tempting to decry monopolies for “profiteering” at the expense of the public. 
And indeed, a monopoly firm does earn a higher profit by virtue of its market 
power. According to the economic analysis of monopoly, however, the firm’s 
profit is not in itself necessarily a problem for society.
Welfare in a monopolized market, like all markets, includes the welfare of 
both consumers and producers. Whenever a consumer pays an extra dollar to a 
producer because of a monopoly price, the consumer is worse off by a dollar, and 
the producer is better off by the same amount. This transfer from the consumers 
of the good to the owners of the monopoly does not affect the market’s total 
surplus—the sum of consumer and producer surplus. In other words, the mono­
poly profit itself represents not a reduction in the size of the economic pie but 
merely a bigger slice for producers and a smaller slice for consumers. Unless 
consumers are for some reason more deserving than producers—a normative 
judgment about equity that goes beyond the realm of economic efficiency—the 
monopoly profit is not a social problem.
The problem in a monopolized market arises because the firm produces and 
sells a quantity of output below the level that maximizes total surplus. The dead-
weight loss measures how much the economic pie shrinks as a result. This inef-
ficiency is connected to the monopoly’s high price: Consumers buy fewer units 
when the firm raises its price above marginal cost. But keep in mind that the profit 
earned on the units that continue to be sold is not the problem. The problem stems 
from the inefficiently low quantity of output. Put differently, if the high monopoly 
price did not discourage some consumers from buying the good, it would raise 
producer surplus by exactly the amount it reduced consumer surplus, leaving 
total surplus the same as could be achieved by a benevolent social planner.
There is, however, a possible exception to this conclusion. Suppose that a 
monopoly firm has to incur additional costs to maintain its monopoly position. For 
example, a firm with a government-created monopoly might need to hire lobby­ists 
to convince lawmakers to continue its monopoly. In this case, the monopoly may 
use up some of its monopoly profits paying for these additional costs. If so, the 
social loss from monopoly includes both these costs and the deadweight loss 
resulting from a price above marginal cost. 
Quick Quiz  How does a monopolist’s quantity of output compare to the quantity 
of output that maximizes total surplus? How does this difference relate to the concept 
of deadweight loss?

Price Discrimination
So far, we have been assuming that the monopoly firm charges the same price to 
all customers. Yet in many cases, firms sell the same good to different customers 
for different prices, even though the costs of producing for the two customers are 
the same. This practice is called price discrimination.
Before discussing the behavior of a price-discriminating monopolist, we should 
note that price discrimination is not possible when a good is sold in a competi-
tive market. In a competitive market, many firms are selling the same good at the 
market price. No firm is willing to charge a lower price to any customer because 
the firm can sell all it wants at the market price. And if any firm tried to charge a 
higher price to a customer, that customer would buy from another firm. For a firm 
to price discriminate, it must have some market power.
A Parable about Pricing
To understand why a monopolist would price discriminate, let’s consider an 
example. Imagine that you are the president of Readalot Publishing Company. 
Readalot’s best-selling author has just written a new novel. To keep things 
simple, let’s imagine that you pay the author a flat $2 million for the exclusive 
rights to publish the book. Let’s also assume that the cost of printing the book is 
zero. Readalot’s profit, therefore, is the revenue from selling the book minus the 
$2 million it has paid to the author. Given these assumptions, how would you, as 
Readalot’s president, decide the book’s price?
Your first step is to estimate the demand for the book. Readalot’s marketing 
department tells you that the book will attract two types of readers. The book will 
appeal to the author’s 100,000 die-hard fans who are willing to pay as much as 
$30. In addition, the book will appeal to about 400,000 less enthusiastic readers 
who will pay up to $5.
If Readalot charges a single price to all customers, what price maximizes 
profit? There are two natural prices to consider: $30 is the highest price Readalot 
can charge and still get the 100,000 die-hard fans, and $5 is the highest price it 
can charge and still get the entire market of 500,000 potential readers. Solving 
Readalot’s problem is a matter of simple arithmetic. At a price of $30, Readalot 
sells 100,000 copies, has revenue of $3 million, and makes profit of $1 million. At 
a price of $5, it sells 500,000 copies, has revenue of $2.5 million, and makes profit 
of $500,000. Thus, Readalot maximizes profit by charging $30 and forgoing the 
opportunity to sell to the 400,000 less enthusiastic readers.
Notice that Readalot’s decision causes a deadweight loss. There are 400,000 
readers willing to pay $5 for the book, and the marginal cost of providing it 
to them is zero. Thus, $2 million of total surplus is lost when Readalot charges 
the higher price. This deadweight loss is the inefficiency that arises whenever a 
monopolist charges a price above marginal cost.
Now suppose that Readalot’s marketing department makes a discovery: These 
two groups of readers are in separate markets. The die-hard fans live in Australia, 
and the other readers live in the United States. Moreover, it is hard for readers in 
one country to buy books in the other. 
In response to this discovery, Readalot can change its marketing strategy and 
increase profits. To the 100,000 Australian readers, it can charge $30 for the book. 
To the 400,000 American readers, it can charge $5 for the book. In this case, reve­
nue is $3 million in Australia and $2 million in the United States, for a total of

$5 million. Profit is then $3 million, which is substantially greater than the $1 
million the company could earn charging the same $30 price to all customers. 
Not surprisingly, Readalot chooses to follow this strategy of price discrimination.
The story of Readalot Publishing is hypothetical, but it describes accurately 
the business practice of many publishing companies. Textbooks, for example, are 
often sold at a lower price in Europe than in the United States. Even more impor-
tant is the price differential between hardcover books and paperbacks. When a 
publisher has a new novel, it initially releases an expensive hardcover edition and 
later releases a cheaper paperback edition. The difference in price between these 
two editions far exceeds the difference in printing costs. The publisher’s goal is 
just as in our example. By selling the hardcover to die-hard fans and the paperback 
to less enthusiastic readers, the publisher price discriminates and raises its profit. 
The Moral of the Story
Like any parable, the story of Readalot Publishing is stylized. Yet also like any 
parable, it teaches some general lessons. In this case, three lessons can be learned 
about price discrimination.
The first and most obvious lesson is that price discrimination is a rational 
strategy for a profit-maximizing monopolist. That is, by charging different prices 
to different customers, a monopolist can increase its profit. In essence, a price-
discriminating monopolist charges each customer a price closer to his or her will-
ingness to pay than is possible with a single price.
The second lesson is that price discrimination requires the ability to separate 
customers according to their willingness to pay. In our example, customers were 
separated geographically. But sometimes monopolists choose other differences, 
such as age or income, to distinguish among customers.
A corollary to this second lesson is that certain market forces can prevent firms 
from price discriminating. In particular, one such force is arbitrage, the process 
of buying a good in one market at a low price and selling it in another market at 
a higher price to profit from the price difference. In our example, if Australian 
bookstores could buy the book in the United States and resell it to Australian 
readers, the arbitrage would prevent Readalot from price discriminating, because 
no Australian would buy the book at the higher price.
The third lesson from our parable is the most surprising: Price discrimination 
can raise economic welfare. Recall that a deadweight loss arises when Readalot 
charges a single $30 price because the 400,000 less enthusiastic readers do not 
end up with the book, even though they value it at more than its marginal cost 
of production. By contrast, when Readalot price discriminates, all readers get the 
book, and the outcome is efficient. Thus, price discrimination can eliminate the 
inefficiency inherent in monopoly pricing.
Note that in this example the increase in welfare from price discrimination 
shows up as higher producer surplus rather than higher consumer surplus. 
Consumers are no better off for having bought the book: The price they pay 
exactly equals the value they place on the book, so they receive no consumer 
surplus. The entire increase in total surplus from price discrimination accrues to 
Readalot Publishing in the form of higher profit. 
The Analytics of Price Discrimination
Let’s consider a bit more formally how price discrimination affects economic 
welfare. We begin by assuming that the monopolist can price discriminate per-
fectly. Perfect price discrimination describes a situation in which the monopolist

knows exactly each customer’s willingness to pay and can charge each customer 
a different price. In this case, the monopolist charges each customer exactly his 
or her willingness to pay, and the monopolist gets the entire surplus in every 
transaction.
Figure 9 illustrates producer and consumer surplus with and without price 
discrimination. To keep things simple, this figure is drawn assuming constant per 
unit costs—that is, marginal cost and average total cost are constant and equal. 
Without price discrimination, the firm charges a single price above marginal cost, 
as shown in panel (a). Because some potential customers who value the good at 
more than marginal cost do not buy it at this high price, the monopoly causes a 
deadweight loss. Yet when a firm can perfectly price discriminate, as shown in 
panel (b), each customer who values the good at more than marginal cost buys the 
good and is charged his or her willingness to pay. All mutually beneficial trades 
take place, no deadweight loss occurs, and the entire surplus derived from the 
market goes to the monopoly producer in the form of profit.
In reality, of course, price discrimination is not perfect. Customers do not 
walk into stores with signs displaying their willingness to pay. Instead, firms 
price discriminate by dividing customers into groups: young versus old, week-
day versus weekend shoppers, Americans versus Australians, and so on. Unlike 
those in our parable of Readalot Publishing, customers within each group differ 
in their willingness to pay for the product, making perfect price discrimination 
impossible.

Price Discrimination
Panel (a) shows a monopolist that charges the same price to all customers. 
Total surplus in this market equals the sum of profit (producer surplus) and 
consumer surplus. Panel (b) shows a monopolist that can perfectly price 
discriminate. Because consumer surplus equals zero, total surplus now equals 
the firm’s profit. Comparing these two panels, you can see that perfect price 
discrimination raises profit, raises total surplus, and lowers consumer surplus.

How does this imperfect price discrimination affect welfare? The analysis of 
these pricing schemes is quite complicated, and it turns out that there is no gen-
eral answer to this question. Compared to the monopoly outcome with a single 
price, imperfect price discrimination can raise, lower, or leave unchanged total 
surplus in a market. The only certain conclusion is that price discrimination raises 
the monopoly’s profit; otherwise, the firm would choose to charge all customers 
the same price.
Examples of Price Discrimination
Firms in our economy use various business strategies aimed at charging different 
prices to different customers. Now that we understand the economics of price 
discrimination, let’s consider some examples.
Movie Tickets  Many movie theaters charge a lower price for children and 
senior citizens than for other patrons. This fact is hard to explain in a competitive 
market. In a competitive market, price equals marginal cost, and the marginal cost 
of providing a seat for a child or senior citizen is the same as the marginal cost 
of providing a seat for anyone else. Yet the differential pricing is easily explained 
if movie theaters have some local monopoly power and if children and senior 
citizens have a lower willingness to pay for a ticket. In this case, movie theaters 
raise their profit by price discriminating.
Airline Prices  Seats on airplanes are sold at many different prices. Most airlines 
charge a lower price for a round-trip ticket between two cities if the traveler stays 
over a Saturday night. At first, this seems odd. Why should it matter to the airline 
whether a passenger stays over a Saturday night? The reason is that this rule pro-
vides a way to separate business travelers and leisure travelers. A passenger on a 
business trip has a high willingness to pay and, most likely, does not want to stay 
over a Saturday night. By contrast, a passenger traveling for personal reasons has 
a lower willingness to pay and is more likely to be willing to stay over a Saturday 
night. Thus, the airlines can successfully price discriminate by charging a lower 
price for passengers who stay over a Saturday night.
Discount Coupons  Many companies offer discount coupons to the public in 
newspapers, magazines, or online. A buyer simply has to clip the coupon to get 
$0.50 off his or her next purchase. Why do companies offer these coupons? Why 
don’t they just cut the price of the product by $0.50?
The answer is that coupons allow companies to price discriminate. Companies 
know that not all customers are willing to spend time clipping coupons. Moreover, 
the willingness to clip coupons is related to the customer’s willingness to pay for 
the good. A rich and busy executive is unlikely to spend her time clipping dis-
count coupons out of the newspaper, and she is probably willing to pay a higher 
price for many goods. A person who is unemployed is more likely to clip coupons 
and to have a lower willingness to pay. Thus, by charging a lower price only to 
those customers who clip coupons, firms can successfully price discriminate.
Financial Aid  Many colleges and universities give financial aid to needy stu-
dents. One can view this policy as a type of price discrimination. Wealthy students 
have greater financial resources and, therefore, a higher willingness to pay than 
needy students. By charging high tuition and selectively offering financial aid, 
schools in effect charge prices to customers based on the value they place on going to 
that school. This behavior is similar to that of any price-discriminating monopolist.

Quantity Discounts  So far in our examples of price discrimination, the 
monopolist charges different prices to different customers. Sometimes, however, 
monopolists price discriminate by charging different prices to the same customer 
for different units that the customer buys. For example, many firms offer lower 
prices to customers who buy large quantities. A bakery might charge $0.50 for 
each donut but $5 for a dozen. This is a form of price discrimination because 
the customer pays a higher price for the first unit bought than for the twelfth. 
Quantity discounts are often a successful way of price discriminating because a 
customer’s willingness to pay for an additional unit declines as the customer buys 
more units.

discrimination affect consumer surplus, producer surplus, and total surplus?

people, on average, attend Broadway 
shows.
	
As avid theatergoers know, ticket prices 
have been rising inexorably. The top ticket 
price for Broadway shows has risen 31 
percent since 1998. But the actual price paid 
has gone up by only 24 percent.
	
The difference is a result of discounting. 
Savvy fans know that there are deals avail-
able for even the most popular shows, with 
the most popular discounts being offered 
through coupons, two-for-one deals, special 
prices for students, and through the TKTS 
booth in Times Square.
	
Why so much discounting? The value of 
a seat in a theater, like a seat on an airplane, 
is highly perishable. Once the show starts or 
the plane takes off, a seat is worth next to 
nothing. 
	
In both industries, sellers use a variety 
of strategies to try to ensure that the seats 
are sold to those who are willing to pay the 
most.
	
This phenomenon was examined recently 
by a Stanford economist, Phillip Leslie, in an 
article, “Price Discrimination in Broadway 
 TKTS and Other Schemes
Economist Hal Varian discusses a dramatic example of price 
discrimination.

of output and, as a result, charge prices above marginal cost. Policymakers in the 
government can respond to the problem of monopoly in one of four ways:
• 	 By trying to make monopolized industries more competitive.
• 	 By regulating the behavior of the monopolies.
• 	 By turning some private monopolies into public enterprises.
• 	 By doing nothing at all.
Increasing Competition with Antitrust Laws
If Coca-Cola and PepsiCo wanted to merge, the deal would be closely examined by 
the federal government before it went into effect. The lawyers and economists in the 
Department of Justice might well decide that a merger between these two large soft 
drink companies would make the U.S. soft drink market substantially less competi-
tive and, as a result, would reduce the economic well-being of the country as a whole. 
If so, the Department of Justice would challenge the merger in court, and if the judge 
agreed, the two companies would not be allowed to merge. It is precisely this kind of 
challenge that prevented software giant Microsoft from buying Intuit in 1994.
The government derives this power over private industry from the antitrust 
laws, a collection of statutes aimed at curbing monopoly power. The first and 
most important of these laws was the Sherman Antitrust Act, which Congress 
passed in 1890 to reduce the market power of the large and powerful “trusts” that 
Theater,” published in the autumn 2004 
issue of the RAND Journal of Economics.
	
Mr. Leslie was able to collect detailed data 
on a 1996 Broadway play, “Seven Guitars.” 
Over 140,000 people saw this play, and they 
bought tickets in 17 price categories. Some 
price variation was due to the quality of the 
seats—orchestra, mezzanine, balcony and 
so on—while other price differences were a 
result of various forms of discounting.
	
The combination of quality variation and 
discounts led to widely varying ticket prices. 
The average difference of two tickets chosen 
at random on a given night was about 40 
percent of the average price. This is compa-
rable to the price variation in airline tickets. . . .
	
The ticket promotions also varied over 
the 199 performances of the show. Targeted 
direct mail was used early on, while two-for-
one tickets were not introduced until about 
halfway through the run.
	
The tickets offered for sale at the TKTS 
booth in Times Square are typically orchestra 
seats, the best category of seats available. 
But the discounted tickets at TKTS tend to 
be the lower-quality orchestra seats. They 
sell at a fixed discount of 50 percent, but are 
offered only for performances that day.
	
Mr. Leslie’s goal was primarily to model 
the behavior of the theatergoer. The audi-
ence for Broadway shows is highly diverse. 
About 10 percent, according to a 1991 sur-
vey conducted by Broadway producers, had 
household incomes of $25,000 or $35,000 
while an equal number had incomes over 
$150,000 (in 1990 dollars).
	
The prices and discounting policy set by 
the producers of Broadway shows try to use 
this heterogeneity to get people to sort them-
selves by their willingness to pay for tickets.
	
You probably will not see Donald Trump 
waiting in line at TKTS; presumably, those 
in his income class do not mind paying full 
price. But a lot of students, unemployed 
actors and tourists do use TKTS.
	
Yes, it is inconvenient to wait in line 
at TKTS. But that is the point. If it weren’t 
inconvenient, everyone would do it, and this 
would result in substantially lower revenues 
for Broadway shows.
	
Mr. Leslie uses some advanced econo-
metric techniques to estimate the values 
that different income groups put on the 
various categories of tickets. He finds that 
Broadway producers do a pretty good job, 
in general, at maximizing revenue. . . . 
	
We are likely to see more and more 
goods and services sold using the same sort 
of differential pricing. As more and more 
transactions become computer-mediated, it 
becomes easier for sellers to collect data, to 
experiment with pricing and to analyze the 
results of those experiments.
	
This, of course, makes life more complicated 
for us consumers. The flip side is that pricing 
variations make those good deals more likely.
	
Last time I was in New York, I was 
pleased that I managed to get a ticket to 
“The Producers” for half price. It almost 
made up for the fact that I had to book my 
airline ticket two weeks in advance and stay 
over a Saturday night.

were viewed as dominating the economy at the time. The Clayton Antitrust Act, 
passed in 1914, strengthened the government’s powers and authorized private 
lawsuits. As the U.S. Supreme Court once put it, the antitrust laws are “a com-
prehensive charter of economic liberty aimed at preserving free and unfettered 
competition as the rule of trade.”
The antitrust laws give the government various ways to promote competition. 
They allow the government to prevent mergers, such as our hypothetical merger 
between Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. They also allow the government to break up 
companies. For example, in 1984, the government split up AT&T, the large tele­
communications company, into eight smaller companies. Finally, the antitrust 
laws prevent companies from coordinating their activities in ways that make 
markets less competitive.
Antitrust laws have costs as well as benefits. Sometimes companies merge not 
to reduce competition but to lower costs through more efficient joint production. 
These benefits from mergers are sometimes called synergies. For example, many

Trustbusters Try to 
Reclaim Decades of 
Lost Ground
By Thomas Catan 
W
ashington—If populism is emerg-
ing as a potent new force in American 
politics, then government trustbusters and 
sympathetic Democrats in Congress stand 
ready to offer a new outlet. But first, they’ll 
have to overcome a major hurdle: the judges.
	
Over the past three decades, U.S. 
courts have sharply limited the scope of the 
120-year-old Sherman Antitrust Act, which 
has been used to target companies from 
Standard Oil to Microsoft Corp. In so doing, 
judges have clipped the wings of two agencies 
charged with policing anticompetitive behav-
ior: the Justice Department and the Federal 
Trade Commission.
	
Now Democrats on Capitol Hill are 
joining forces with antitrust cops to push 
back against the judicial tide. Congress is 
preparing measures to reverse the effect of 
court rulings that have made it harder for 
the government to win antitrust cases and 
break up monopolies, while the FTC and 
Justice Department are trying out new legal 
tactics to reclaim lost powers
	
If successful, the efforts could pres-
age an upswing in antitrust cases against 
America’s leading companies and reverse 
the legal trends of recent years.
	
Sensing a shift in the political land-
scape, big business is girding for a fight. 
“Voters are demanding jobs and growth, 
but Washington is moving in the opposite 
direction by advancing an agenda focused on 
increased litigation against business,” said 
Lisa Rickard, president of the U.S. Chamber 
Institute for Legal Reform, an offshoot of the 
Chamber of Commerce that seeks to ease 
the burden of civil litigation for businesses.
	
Antitrust enforcers since the 1980s have 
had an increasingly hard time winning cases 
against accused monopolists. Judges have 
largely agreed with the reasoning of the 
so-called Chicago School of economists, 
which holds that big companies aren’t 
necessarily bad and that the market—not 
government—is best placed to promote 
competition.
	
The administration of George W. Bush 
largely agreed. Its Justice Department didn’t 
accuse a single company of improperly

acquiring or maintaining a monopoly in a 
case not involving a merger. In 2008, it 
enshrined its thinking in official guidelines 
that significantly raised the bar for bringing 
such a monopolization case.
	
The new administration is taking a 
different tack. President Barack Obama 
vowed to “reinvigorate” antitrust enforce-
ment, and his antitrust chief, Christine 
Varney, ripped up the Bush-era guidelines 
last spring. 
	
So far, the talk hasn’t been matched 
by action. The Justice Department in the 
Obama administration has yet to bring a 
monopolization case. And the only FTC case 
brought so far—against microchip giant 
Intel Corp.—was already being built when 
it came to power.
	
In part, that’s because the Supreme 
Court has embraced many antitrust prin-
ciples that the Bush administration advo-
cated, said Joseph Angland, an antitrust 
lawyer at White & Case. “Those changes are 
now law of the land and they do constrain 
the ability of the Obama administration to 
bring certain types of actions,” he said.
	
Congressional Democrats want to show 
they can protect consumers. They say they 
want to aid family farmers squeezed by 
giant seed manufacturers and distributors. 
They want to free up Internet retailers to 
discount products below manufacturers’ 
minimum price. And they want to stop 
pharmaceutical companies from paying 
generic-drug makers to delay cheap copies 
of medicines. But in each of these areas they 
are blocked by recent Supreme Court deci-
sions, so Congress is considering a series of 
legislative fixes. One would be in response to a 
2007 Supreme Court decision, Leegin Creative 
Leather Products v. PSKS.
	
In that 5-4 ruling, the court overturned 
nearly a century of jurisprudence that had 
declared a practice known as retail price 
maintenance to be an automatic crime. 
That might involve, for instance, a jeans 
manufacturer that forbids a department 
store from selling its pants below its desired 
level. A bill sponsored by Sen. Herb Kohl (D., 
Wisc.) would restore the absolute ban.
	
Another bill sponsored by Sen. Arlen 
Specter (D., Pa.), with a matching version 
pending in the House, would try to counter 
a different 2007 Supreme Court decision—
Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly—that made 
it easier for defendants to get antitrust 
claims dismissed.
	
Trial lawyers, who as a group are 
among the top financial donors to the 
Democratic Party, have declared passing 
the bill among their top legislative priorities. 
AT&T Inc., Procter & Gamble Co., Verizon 
Communications Inc. and other big com-
panies oppose the bills, saying they would 
trigger a flood of frivolous and costly cases.
	
“Every business group I’ve spoken to 
regards this as a very serious issue, espe-
cially given the economy and the expense of 
dealing with frivolous litigation,” said John 
Thorne, Verizon’s deputy general counsel.
	
Antitrust enforcers are taking parallel 
action. The Justice Department is looking for 
test cases to expand its antitrust authority. 
And the FTC wants to circumvent the courts’ 
narrow interpretation of the Sherman Act by 
reclaiming a legal tool it has hardly used in 
more than two decades—Section 5 of the 
1914 law that created the agency.
	
Invoked in the FTC’s Intel suit, that law 
allows the FTC to act against a company 
that engages in “unfair methods of compe-
tition.” The law largely fell into disuse after 
courts repeatedly slapped down the FTC for 
using it too broadly.
	
“Antitrust law is far more restrictive 
than it was 30 years ago and if we want to 
accomplish our mission of protecting con-
sumers in an age of judicial conservatism, 
we need to use every tool in our arsenal,” 
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz said last fall.

U.S. banks have merged in recent years and, by combining operations, have been 
able to reduce administrative staff. If antitrust laws are to raise social welfare, the 
government must be able to determine which mergers are desirable and which 
are not. That is, it must be able to measure and compare the social benefit from 
synergies with the social costs of reduced competition. Critics of the antitrust laws 
are skeptical that the government can perform the necessary cost–benefit analysis 
with sufficient accuracy.
Regulation
Another way the government deals with the problem of monopoly is by regulat-
ing the behavior of monopolists. This solution is common in the case of natural 
monopolies, such as water and electric companies. These companies are not 
allowed to charge any price they want. Instead, government agencies regulate 
their prices.

What price should the government set for a natural monopoly? This question 
is not as easy as it might at first appear. One might conclude that the price should 
equal the monopolist’s marginal cost. If price equals marginal cost, customers will 
buy the quantity of the monopolist’s output that maximizes total surplus, and the 
allocation of resources will be efficient.
There are, however, two practical problems with marginal-cost pricing as a reg-
ulatory system. The first arises from the logic of cost curves. By definition, natural 
monopolies have declining average total cost. As we first discussed in Chapter     , 
when average total cost is declining, marginal cost is less than average total cost. 
This situation is illustrated in Figure 10, which shows a firm with a large fixed cost 
and then constant marginal cost thereafter. If regulators were to set price equal to 
marginal cost, that price must be less than the firm’s average total cost, and the 
firm would lose money. Instead of charging such a low price, the monopoly firm 
would just exit the industry.
Regulators can respond to this problem in various ways, none of which is perfect. 
One way is to subsidize the monopolist. In essence, the government picks up the 
losses inherent in marginal-cost pricing. Yet to pay for the subsidy, the government 
needs to raise money through taxation, which involves its own deadweight losses. 
Alternatively, the regulators can allow the monopolist to charge a price higher than 
marginal cost. If the regulated price equals average total cost, the monopolist earns 
exactly zero economic profit. Yet average-cost pricing leads to deadweight losses 
because the monopolist’s price no longer reflects the marginal cost of producing the 
good. In essence, average-cost pricing is like a tax on the good the monopolist is selling.
The second problem with marginal-cost pricing as a regulatory system (and 
with average-cost pricing as well) is that it gives the monopolist no incentive to 
reduce costs. Each firm in a competitive market tries to reduce its costs because 
lower costs mean higher profits. But if a regulated monopolist knows that regula-
tors will reduce prices whenever costs fall, the monopolist will not benefit from 
lower costs. In practice, regulators deal with this problem by allowing mono­
polists to keep some of the benefits from lower costs in the form of higher profit, 
a practice that requires some departure from marginal-cost pricing.
Figure 10
Marginal-Cost Pricing for a 
Natural Monopoly
Because a natural monopoly 
has declining average total 
cost, marginal cost is less 
than average total cost. 
Therefore, if regulators 
require a natural monopoly 
to charge a price equal to 
marginal cost, price will be 
below average total cost, 
and the monopoly will lose 
money.

Public Ownership
The third policy used by the government to deal with monopoly is public owner-
ship. That is, rather than regulating a natural monopoly that is run by a private 
firm, the government can run the monopoly itself. This solution is common in 
many European countries, where the government owns and operates utilities 
such as telephone, water, and electric companies. In the United States, the govern­
ment runs the Postal Service. The delivery of ordinary first-class mail is often 
thought to be a natural monopoly. 
Economists usually prefer private to public ownership of natural monopolies. The 
key issue is how the ownership of the firm affects the costs of production. Private 
owners have an incentive to minimize costs as long as they reap part of the benefit in 
the form of higher profit. If the firm’s managers are doing a bad job of keeping costs 
down, the firm’s owners will fire them. By contrast, if the government bureaucrats 
who run a monopoly do a bad job, the losers are the customers and taxpayers, whose 
only recourse is the political system. The bureaucrats may become a special-interest 
group and attempt to block cost-reducing reforms. Put simply, as a way of ensuring 
that firms are well run, the voting booth is less reliable than the profit motive.
Doing Nothing
Each of the foregoing policies aimed at reducing the problem of monopoly has draw-
backs. As a result, some economists argue that it is often best for the govern­ment not to 
try to remedy the inefficiencies of monopoly pricing. Here is the assessment of econo-
mist George Stigler, who won the Nobel Prize for his work in industrial organization:
A famous theorem in economics states that a competitive enterprise economy 
will produce the largest possible income from a given stock of resources. No 
real economy meets the exact conditions of the theorem, and all real economies 
will fall short of the ideal economy—a difference called “market failure.” In 
my view, however, the degree of “market failure” for the American economy 
is much smaller than the “political failure” arising from the imperfections of 
economic policies found in real political systems.
As this quotation makes clear, determining the proper role of the government in 
the economy requires judgments about politics as well as economics.

Conclusion: The Prevalence of Monopolies
This chapter has discussed the behavior of firms that have control over the prices 
they charge. We have seen that these firms behave very differently from the com-
petitive firms studied in the previous chapter. Table 2 summarizes some of the 
key similarities and differences between competitive and monopoly markets.
From the standpoint of public policy, a crucial result is that a monopolist pro-
duces less than the socially efficient quantity and charges a price above marginal 
cost. As a result, a monopoly causes deadweight losses. In some cases, these inef-
ficiencies can be mitigated through price discrimination by the monopolist, but 
other times, they call for policymakers to take an active role.
How prevalent are the problems of monopoly? There are two answers to this 
question.
In one sense, monopolies are common. Most firms have some control over the 
prices they charge. They are not forced to charge the market price for their goods

Summary
because their goods are not exactly the same as those offered by other firms. A 
Ford Taurus is not the same as a Toyota Camry. Ben and Jerry’s ice cream is not 
the same as Breyer’s. Each of these goods has a downward-sloping demand curve, 
which gives each producer some degree of monopoly power.
Yet firms with substantial monopoly power are rare. Few goods are truly 
unique. Most have substitutes that, even if not exactly the same, are similar. Ben 
and Jerry can raise the price of their ice cream a little without losing all their sales, 
but if they raise it a lot, sales will fall substantially as their customers switch to 
another brand. 
In the end, monopoly power is a matter of degree. It is true that many firms 
have some monopoly power. It is also true that their monopoly power is usually 
limited. In such a situation, we will not go far wrong assuming that firms operate 
in competitive markets, even if that is not precisely the case.

Competition versus 
Monopoly: A Summary 
Comparison
Table 2
• A monopoly is a firm that is the sole seller in its 
market. A monopoly arises when a single firm 
owns a key resource, when the government gives 
a firm the exclusive right to produce a good, or 
when a single firm can supply the entire market 
at a lower cost than many firms could.
• Because a monopoly is the sole producer in its 
market, it faces a downward-sloping demand 
curve for its product. When a monopoly increases 
production by 1 unit, it causes the price of its 
good to fall, which reduces the amount of reve­
nue earned on all units produced. As a result, a 
monopoly’s marginal revenue is always below 
the price of its good.
• Like a competitive firm, a monopoly firm maxi-
mizes profit by producing the quantity at which 
marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The 
monopoly then chooses the price at which that 
quantity is demanded. Unlike a competitive firm, 
a monopoly firm’s price exceeds its marginal 
reve­nue, so its price exceeds marginal cost.
• 
A monopolist’s profit-maximizing level of output is 
below the level that maximizes the sum of consumer 
and producer surplus. That is, when the monopoly 
charges a price above marginal cost, some consum-
ers who value the good more than its cost of pro-
duction do not buy it. As a result, monopoly causes 
deadweight losses similar to those caused by taxes.

• A monopolist often can raise its profits by charg-
ing different prices for the same good based on 
a buyer’s willingness to pay. This practice of 
price discrimination can raise economic welfare 
by getting the good to some consumers who 
otherwise would not buy it. In the extreme case 
of perfect price discrimination, the deadweight 
loss of monopoly is completely eliminated, and 
the entire surplus in the market goes to the 
monopoly producer. More generally, when price 
discrimination is imperfect, it can either raise or 
lower welfare compared to the outcome with a 
single monopoly price.
• Policymakers can respond to the inefficiency of 
monopoly behavior in four ways. They can use 
the antitrust laws to try to make the industry more 
competitive. They can regulate the prices that the 
monopoly charges. They can turn the monopolist 
into a government-run enterprise. Or if the market 
failure is deemed small compared to the inevitable 
imperfections of policies, they can do nothing at all.

d.	In your graph, shade in the deadweight loss. 
Explain in words what this means.
e.	 If the author were paid $3 million instead of 
$2 million to write the book, how would this 
affect the publisher’s decision regarding what 
price to charge? Explain.
f.	 Suppose the publisher was not profit-­
maximizing but was concerned with maxi-
mizing economic efficiency. What price 
would it charge for the book? How much 
profit would it make at this price?
	 2.	 A small town is served by many competing 
supermarkets, which have the same constant 
marginal cost. 
a.	 Using a diagram of the market for groceries, 
show the consumer surplus, producer  
surplus, and total surplus.
b.	 Now suppose that the independent super-
markets combine into one chain. Using a new 
diagram, show the new consumer surplus, 
producer surplus, and total surplus. Relative 
to the competitive market, what is the transfer 
from consumers to producers? What is the 
deadweight loss?
	 3.	 Johnny Rockabilly has just finished recording 
his latest CD. His record company’s marketing 
department determines that the demand for the 
CD is as follows:
	
Price	
Number of CDs
	
$24	
10,000
	
22	
20,000
	
20	
30,000
	
18	
40,000
	
16	
50,000
	
14	
60,000
	 	 The company can produce the CD with no fixed 
cost and a variable cost of $5 per CD.
a.	 Find total revenue for quantity equal to 
10,000, 20,000, and so on. What is the  
marginal revenue for each 10,000 increase in 
the quantity sold?
b.	What quantity of CDs would maximize profit? 
What would the price be? What would the 
profit be?
c.	 If you were Johnny’s agent, what recording 
fee would you advise Johnny to demand 
from the record company? Why?
	 4.	 A company is considering building a bridge 
across a river. The bridge would cost $2 million 
to build and nothing to maintain. The following 
table shows the company’s anticipated demand 
over the lifetime of the bridge:
	
	
Number of Crossings,  
	
Price per Crossing	
in Thousands
	
$8

a.	 If the company were to build the bridge, 
what would be its profit-maximizing price? 
Would that be the efficient level of output? 
Why or why not?
b.	If the company is interested in maximizing  
profit, should it build the bridge? What 
would be its profit or loss?
c.	 If the government were to build the bridge, 
what price should it charge?
d.	Should the government build the bridge? 
Explain.
	 5.	 Larry, Curly, and Moe run the only saloon in town. 
Larry wants to sell as many drinks as possible 
without losing money. Curly wants the saloon to 
bring in as much revenue as possible. Moe wants 
to make the largest possible profits. Using a single 
diagram of the saloon’s demand curve and its cost 
curves, show the price and quantity combinations 
favored by each of the three partners. Explain.
	 6.	 The residents of the town Ectenia all love  
economics, and the mayor proposes building an 
economics museum. The museum has a fixed 
cost of $2,400,000 and no variable costs. There 
are 100,000 town residents, and each has the 
same demand for museum visits: QD = 10 – P, 
where P is the price of admission.
a.	 Graph the museum’s average-total-cost curve 
and its marginal-cost curve. What kind of 
market would describe the museum?
b.	The mayor proposes financing the museum 
with a lump-sum tax of $24 and then opening 
the museum free to the public. How many 
times would each person visit? Calculate 
the benefit each person would get from the 
museum, measured as consumer surplus 
minus the new tax.
c.	 The mayor’s anti-tax opponent says the 
museum should finance itself by charging an 
admission fee. What is the lowest price the 
museum can charge without incurring losses? 
(Hint: Find the number of visits and museum 
profits for prices of $2, $3, $4, and $5.)

d.	For the break-even price you found in part 
(c), calculate each resident’s consumer surplus. 
Compared with the mayor’s plan, who is  
better off with this admission fee, and who is 
worse off? Explain.
e.	 What real-world considerations absent in the 
above problem might argue in favor of an 
admission fee?
	 7. 	For many years, AT&T was a regulated  
monopoly, providing both local and long-distance 
telephone service.
a.	 Explain why long-distance phone service  
was originally a natural monopoly.
b.	Over the past two decades, many companies 
have launched communication satellites, each 
of which can transmit a limited number of 
calls. How did the growing role of satellites 
change the cost structure of long-distance 
phone service?
	 	 After a lengthy legal battle with the government, 
AT&T agreed to compete with other companies 
in the long-distance market. It also agreed to 
spin off its local phone service into the “Baby 
Bells,” which remain highly regulated.
c.	 Why might it be efficient to have competition 
in long-distance phone service and regulated 
monopolies in local phone service?
	 8.	 Consider the relationship between monopoly 
pricing and price elasticity of demand:
a.	 Explain why a monopolist will never produce 
a quantity at which the demand curve is 
inelastic. (Hint: If demand is inelastic and the 
firm raises its price, what happens to total 
revenue and total costs?) 
b.	Draw a diagram for a monopolist, precisely 
labeling the portion of the demand curve that 
is inelastic. (Hint: The answer is related to the 
marginal-revenue curve.)
c.	 On your diagram, show the quantity and 
price that maximizes total revenue.
	 9.	 If the government wanted to encourage a monopoly 
to produce the socially efficient quantity, should 
it use a per-unit tax or a per-unit subsidy? Explain 
how this tax or subsidy would achieve the socially 
efficient level of output. Among the various inter-
ested parties—the monopoly firm, the monopoly’s 
consumers, and other taxpayers—who would  
support the policy and who would oppose it?
	10.	 You live in a town with 300 adults and 200 
children, and you are thinking about putting 
on a play to entertain your neighbors and make 
some money. A play has a fixed cost of $2,000, 
but selling an extra ticket has zero marginal 
cost. Here are the demand schedules for your 
two types of customer:
	
Price	
Adults	
Children

a.	 To maximize profit, what price would you 
charge for an adult ticket? For a child’s  
ticket? How much profit do you make?
b.	The city council passes a law prohibiting you 
from charging different prices to different 
customers. What price do you set for a ticket 
now? How much profit do you make? 
c.	 Who is worse off because of the law prohib-
iting price discrimination? Who is better off? 
(If you can, quantify the changes in welfare.)
d.	If the fixed cost of the play were $2,500 rather 
than $2,000, how would your answers to 
parts (a), (b), and (c) change?
	11.	 Only one firm produces and sells soccer balls in 
the country of Wiknam, and as the story begins, 
international trade in soccer balls is prohibited. 
The following equations describe the monopolist’s 
demand, marginal revenue, total cost, and  
marginal cost:
	
Demand: P = 10 – Q
Marginal Revenue: MR = 10 – 2Q
	
Total Cost: TC = 3 + Q + 0.5Q2
	
 Marginal Cost: MC = 1 + Q
	 	 where Q is quantity and P is the price measured 
in Wiknamian dollars. 
a.	 How many soccer balls does the monopolist 
produce? At what price are they sold? What 
is the monopolist’s profit?
b.	One day, the King of Wiknam decrees that 
henceforth there will be free trade—either 
imports or exports— of soccer balls at the 
world price of $6. The firm is now a price 
taker in a competitive market. What happens  
to domestic production of soccer balls? To 
domestic consumption? Does Wiknam export 
or import soccer balls?

c.	 In our analysis of international trade in 
Chapter 9, a country becomes an exporter 
when the price without trade is below the 
world price and an importer when the price 
without trade is above the world price. Does 
that conclusion hold in your answers to parts 
(a) and (b)? Explain.
d.	Suppose that the world price was not $6 but, 
instead, happened to be exactly the same  
as the domestic price without trade as  
determined in part (a). Would allowing trade 
have changed anything in the Wiknamian  
economy? Explain. How does the result here 
compare with the analysis in Chapter 9?
	12.	 Based on market research, a film production 
company in Ectenia obtains the following 
information about the demand and production 
costs of its new DVD: 
	
Demand: P = 1,000 – 10Q
Total Revenue: TR = 1,000Q – 10Q2
 Marginal Revenue: MR = 1,000 – 20Q 
	
Marginal Cost: MC = 100 + 10Q 
where Q indicates the number of copies sold 
and P is the price in Ectenian dollars.
a.	 Find the price and quantity that maximizes 
the company’s profit.
b.	Find the price and quantity that would  
maximize social welfare.
c.	 Calculate the deadweight loss from monopoly.
d.	Suppose, in addition to the costs above, the 
director of the film has to be paid. The  
company is considering four options:
	 	 i.	
A flat fee of 2,000 Ectenian dollars 
	 	 ii.	 50 percent of the profits
	 	 iii.	 150 Ectenian dollars per unit sold 
	 	 iv.	 50 percent of the revenue
	 	 For each option, calculate the profit- 
maximizing price and quantity. Which, if any, 
of these compensation schemes would alter 
the deadweight loss from monopoly? Explain.
	13.	 Many schemes for price discriminating involve 
some cost. For example, discount coupons take up 
the time and resources of both the buyer and the 
seller. This question considers the implications of 
costly price discrimination. To keep things simple, 
let’s assume that our monopolist’s production 
costs are simply proportional to output so that 
average total cost and marginal cost are constant 
and equal to each other.
a.	 Draw the cost, demand, and marginal-
revenue curves for the monopolist. Show the 
price the monopolist would charge without 
price discrimination. 
b.	In your diagram, mark the area equal to the 
monopolist’s profit and call it X. Mark the 
area equal to consumer surplus and call it Y. 
Mark the area equal to the deadweight loss 
and call it Z.
c.	 Now suppose that the monopolist can  
perfectly price discriminate. What is the 
monopolist’s profit? (Give your answer in 
terms of X, Y, and Z.)
d.	What is the change in the monopolist’s profit 
from price discrimination? What is the change 
in total surplus from price discrimination? 
Which change is larger? Explain. (Give your 
answer in terms of X, Y, and Z.)
e.	 Now suppose that there is some cost of 
price discrimination. To model this cost, let’s 
assume that the monopolist has to pay a fixed 
cost C to price discriminate. How would a 
monopolist make the decision whether to pay 
this fixed cost? (Give your answer in terms of 
X, Y, Z, and C.)
f.	 How would a benevolent social planner, who 
cares about total surplus, decide whether the 
monopolist should price discriminate? (Give 
your answer in terms of X, Y, Z, and C.)
g.	Compare your answers to parts (e) and  
(f). How does the monopolist’s incentive 
to price discriminate differ from the social 
planner’s? Is it possible that the monopolist 
will price discriminate even though it is not 
socially desirable?
