Firms in Competitive
    Markets

f your local gas station raised its price for gasoline by 20 percent, it would see 
a large drop in the amount of gasoline it sold. Its customers would quickly 
switch to buying their gasoline at other gas stations. By contrast, if your local 
water company raised the price of water by 20 percent, it would see only a 
small decrease in the amount of water it sold. People might water their lawns less 
often and buy more water-efficient showerheads, but they would be hard-pressed 
to reduce water consumption greatly and would be unlikely to find another sup-
plier. The difference between the gasoline market and the water market is obvi-
ous: Many firms supply gasoline to the local market, but only one firm supplies 
water. As you might expect, this difference in market structure shapes the pricing 
and production decisions of the firms that operate in these markets.
In this chapter, we examine the behavior of competitive firms, such as your 
local gas station. You may recall that a market is competitive if each buyer and 
seller is small compared to the size of the market and, therefore, has little ability

to influence market prices. By contrast, if a firm can influence the market price of 
the good it sells, it is said to have market power. Later in the book, we examine the 
behavior of firms with market power, such as your local water company.
Our analysis of competitive firms in this chapter sheds light on the decisions 
that lie behind the supply curve in a competitive market. Not surprisingly, we will 
find that a market supply curve is tightly linked to firms’ costs of production. Less 
obvious, however, is the question of which among a firm’s many types of cost—
fixed, variable, average, and marginal—are most relevant for its supply decisions. 
We will see that all these measures of cost play important and interrelated roles.
What Is a Competitive Market?
Our goal in this chapter is to examine how firms make production decisions in 
competitive markets. As a background for this analysis, we begin by reviewing 
what a competitive market is.
The Meaning of Competition
A competitive market, sometimes called a perfectly competitive market, has two 
characteristics:
• 	 There are many buyers and many sellers in the market.
• 	 The goods offered by the various sellers are largely the same.
As a result of these conditions, the actions of any single buyer or seller in the 
market have a negligible impact on the market price. Each buyer and seller takes 
the market price as given.
As an example, consider the market for milk. No single consumer of milk can 
influence the price of milk because each buyer purchases a small amount relative to 
the size of the market. Similarly, each dairy farmer has limited control over the price 
because many other sellers are offering milk that is essentially identical. Because each 
seller can sell all he wants at the going price, he has little reason to charge less, and if 
he charges more, buyers will go elsewhere. Buyers and sellers in competitive markets 
must accept the price the market determines and, therefore, are said to be price takers.
In addition to the foregoing two conditions for competition, there is a third 
condition sometimes thought to characterize perfectly competitive markets:
• 	 Firms can freely enter or exit the market.
If, for instance, anyone can decide to start a dairy farm, and if any existing dairy 
farmer can decide to leave the dairy business, then the dairy industry would satisfy 
this condition. Much of the analysis of competitive firms does not need the assump-
tion of free entry and exit because this condition is not necessary for firms to be 
price takers. Yet, as we will see later in this chapter, if there is free entry and exit 
in a competitive market, it is a powerful force shaping the long-run equilibrium.
The Revenue of a Competitive Firm
A firm in a competitive market, like most other firms in the economy, tries to 
maximize profit (total revenue minus total cost). To see how it does this, we first 
consider the revenue of a competitive firm. To keep matters concrete, let’s con-
sider a specific firm: the Vaca Family Dairy Farm.

The Vaca Farm produces a quantity of milk, Q, and sells each unit at the market 
price, P. The farm’s total revenue is P × Q. For example, if a gallon of milk sells 
for $6 and the farm sells 1,000 gallons, its total revenue is $6,000.
Because the Vaca Farm is small compared to the world market for milk, it takes 
the price as given by market conditions. This means, in particular, that the price 
of milk does not depend on the number of gallons that the Vaca Farm produces 
and sells. If the Vacas double the amount of milk they produce to 2,000 gallons, 
the price of milk remains the same, and their total revenue doubles to $12,000. As 
a result, total revenue is proportional to the amount of output.
Table 1 shows the revenue for the Vaca Family Dairy Farm. The first two 
columns show the amount of output the farm produces and the price at which it 
sells its output. The third column is the farm’s total revenue. The table assumes that 
the price of milk is $6 a gallon, so total revenue is $6 times the number of gallons.
Just as the concepts of average and marginal were useful in the preceding 
chapter when analyzing costs, they are also useful when analyzing revenue. To 
see what these concepts tell us, consider these two questions:
• 	 How much revenue does the farm receive for the typical gallon of milk?
• 	 How much additional revenue does the farm receive if it increases production 
of milk by 1 gallon?
The last two columns in Table 1 answer these questions. 
The fourth column in the table shows average revenue, which is total revenue 
(from the third column) divided by the amount of output (from the first column). 
Average revenue tells us how much revenue a firm receives for the typical unit 
sold. In Table 1, you can see that average revenue equals $6, the price of a gallon 
of milk. This illustrates a general lesson that applies not only to competitive firms 
but to other firms as well. Average revenue is total revenue (P × Q) divided by 
the quantity (Q). Therefore, for all firms, average revenue equals the price of the good.

The fifth column shows marginal revenue, which is the change in total reve­
nue from the sale of each additional unit of output. In Table 1, marginal revenue 
equals $6, the price of a gallon of milk. This result illustrates a lesson that applies 
only to competitive firms. Total revenue is P × Q, and P is fixed for a competi-
tive firm. Therefore, when Q rises by 1 unit, total revenue rises by P dollars. For 
competitive firms, marginal revenue equals the price of the good. 
Quick Quiz  When a competitive firm doubles the amount it sells, what happens to 
the price of its output and its total revenue?
Profit Maximization and the Competitive Firm’s Supply Curve
The goal of a competitive firm is to maximize profit, which equals total revenue 
minus total cost. We have just discussed the firm’s revenue, and in the preceding 
chapter, we discussed the firm’s costs. We are now ready to examine how a com-
petitive firm maximizes profit and how that decision determines its supply curve.
A Simple Example of Profit Maximization
Let’s begin our analysis of the firm’s supply decision with the example in Table 2. 
In the first column of the table is the number of gallons of milk the Vaca Family 
Dairy Farm produces. The second column shows the farm’s total revenue, which 
is $6 times the number of gallons. The third column shows the farm’s total cost. 
Total cost includes fixed costs, which are $3 in this example, and variable costs, 
which depend on the quantity produced.
The fourth column shows the farm’s profit, which is computed by subtracting total 
cost from total revenue. If the farm produces nothing, it has a loss of $3 (its fixed cost). 
If it produces 1 gallon, it has a profit of $1. If it produces 2 gallons, it has a profit of $4 
and so on. Because the Vaca family’s goal is to maximize profit, it chooses to produce 
the quantity of milk that makes profit as large as possible. In this example, profit is 
maximized when the farm produces either 4 or 5 gallons of milk, for a profit of $7.
There is another way to look at the Vaca Farm’s decision: The Vacas can find 
the profit-maximizing quantity by comparing the marginal revenue and marginal 
cost from each unit produced. The fifth and sixth columns in Table 2 compute 
marginal revenue and marginal cost from the changes in total revenue and total 
cost, and the last column shows the change in profit for each additional gallon 
produced. The first gallon of milk the farm produces has a marginal revenue of 
$6 and a marginal cost of $2; hence, producing that gallon increases profit by $4 
(from –$3 to $1). The second gallon produced has a marginal revenue of $6 and a 
marginal cost of $3, so that gallon increases profit by $3 (from $1 to $4). As long as 
marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost, increasing the quantity produced raises 
profit. Once the Vaca Farm has reached 5 gallons of milk, however, the situation 
changes. The sixth gallon would have a marginal revenue of $6 and a marginal 
cost of $7, so producing it would reduce profit by $1 (from $7 to $6). As a result, 
the Vacas would not produce beyond 5 gallons.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that rational people think 
at the margin. We now see how the Vaca Family Dairy Farm can apply this 
principle. If marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost—as it is at 1, 2, or 
3 gallons—the Vacas should increase the production of milk because it will put 
more money in their pockets (marginal revenue) than it takes out (marginal cost).

If marginal revenue is less than marginal cost—as it is at 6, 7, or 8 gallons—the 
Vacas should decrease production. If the Vacas think at the margin and make 
incremental adjustments to the level of production, they are naturally led to pro-
duce the profit-maximizing quantity.
The Marginal-Cost Curve and  
the Firm’s Supply Decision
To extend this analysis of profit maximization, consider the cost curves in Figure 1. 
These cost curves have the three features that, as we discussed in the ­previous 
chapter, are thought to describe most firms: The marginal-cost curve (MC) 
is upward sloping. The average-total-cost curve (ATC) is U-shaped. And the 
­marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at the minimum of average 
total cost. The figure also shows a horizontal line at the market price (P). The price 
line is horizontal because the firm is a price taker: The price of the firm’s output is 
the same regardless of the quantity that the firm decides to produce. Keep in mind 
that, for a competitive firm, the firm’s price equals both its average revenue (AR) 
and its marginal revenue (MR). 
We can use Figure 1 to find the quantity of output that maximizes profit. 
Imagine that the firm is producing at Q1. At this level of output, marginal revenue 
is greater than marginal cost. That is, if the firm raised its level of production and 
sales by 1 unit, the additional revenue (MR1) would exceed the additional cost 
(MC1). Profit, which equals total revenue minus total cost, would increase. Hence, 
if marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost, as it is at Q1, the firm can increase 
profit by increasing production.

A similar argument applies when output is at Q2. In this case, marginal cost is 
greater than marginal revenue. If the firm reduced production by 1 unit, the costs 
saved (MC2) would exceed the revenue lost (MR2). Therefore, if marginal revenue 
is less than marginal cost, as it is at Q2, the firm can increase profit by reducing 
production.
Where do these marginal adjustments to production end? Regardless of whether 
the firm begins with production at a low level (such as Q1) or at a high level (such 
as Q2), the firm will eventually adjust production until the quantity produced 
reaches QMAX. This analysis yields three general rules for profit maximization: 
• 	 If marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost, the firm should increase 
its output.
• 	 If marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue, the firm should decrease 
its output.
• 	 At the profit-maximizing level of output, marginal revenue and marginal 
cost are exactly equal.
These rules are the key to rational decision making by a profit-maximizing firm. 
They apply not only to competitive firms but, as we will see in the next chapter, 
to other types of firms as well.
We can now see how the competitive firm decides the quantity of its good to 
supply to the market. Because a competitive firm is a price taker, its marginal 
reve­nue equals the market price. For any given price, the competitive firm’s 
profit-maximizing quantity of output is found by looking at the intersection of 
the price with the marginal-cost curve. In Figure 1, that quantity of output is QMAX.

This figure shows the marginal-cost curve (MC ), the average-total-cost curve (ATC ), 
and the average-variable-cost curve (AVC ). It also shows the market price (P), 
which equals marginal revenue (MR) and average revenue (AR). At the quantity Q1, 
marginal revenue MR1 exceeds marginal cost MC1, so raising production increases 
profit. At the quantity Q2, marginal cost MC2 is above marginal revenue MR2, so 
reducing production increases profit. The profit-maximizing quantity QMAX is found 
where the horizontal price line intersects the marginal-cost curve.

Suppose that the price prevailing in this market rises, perhaps because of an 
increase in market demand. Figure 2 shows how a competitive firm responds to 
the price increase. When the price is P1, the firm produces quantity Q1, the quantity 
that equates marginal cost to the price. When the price rises to P2, the firm finds 
that marginal revenue is now higher than marginal cost at the previous level of 
output, so the firm increases production. The new profit-maximizing quantity is 
Q2, at which marginal cost equals the new higher price. In essence, because the firm’s 
marginal-cost curve determines the quantity of the good the firm is willing to supply at 
any price, the marginal-cost curve is also the competitive firm’s supply curve. There are, 
however, some caveats to that conclusion, which we examine next.
The Firm’s Short-Run Decision to Shut Down
So far, we have been analyzing the question of how much a competitive firm will 
produce. In certain circumstances, however, the firm will decide to shut down 
and not produce anything at all.
Here we need to distinguish between a temporary shutdown of a firm and the 
permanent exit of a firm from the market. A shutdown refers to a short-run deci-
sion not to produce anything during a specific period of time because of current 
market conditions. Exit refers to a long-run decision to leave the market. The 
short-run and long-run decisions differ because most firms cannot avoid their 
fixed costs in the short run but can do so in the long run. That is, a firm that shuts 
down temporarily still has to pay its fixed costs, whereas a firm that exits the 
market does not have to pay any costs at all, fixed or variable. 
For example, consider the production decision that a farmer faces. The cost of 
the land is one of the farmer’s fixed costs. If the farmer decides not to produce 
any crops one season, the land lies fallow, and he cannot recover this cost. When 
making the short-run decision whether to shut down for a season, the fixed cost of 
land is said to be a sunk cost. By contrast, if the farmer decides to leave farming alto-
gether, he can sell the land. When making the long-run decision whether to exit the 
market, the cost of land is not sunk. (We return to the issue of sunk costs shortly.)
Now let’s consider what determines a firm’s shutdown decision. If the firm 
shuts down, it loses all revenue from the sale of its product. At the same time, it 
Figure 2
Marginal Cost as the Competitive 
Firm’s Supply Curve
An increase in the price from P1 to P2 
leads to an increase in the firm’s profit-
maximizing quantity from Q1 to Q2. 
Because the marginal-cost curve shows 
the quantity supplied by the firm at any 
given price, it is the firm’s supply curve.

saves the variable costs of making its product (but must still pay the fixed costs). 
Thus, the firm shuts down if the revenue that it would earn from producing is less than 
its variable costs of production.
A bit of mathematics can make this shutdown criterion more useful. If TR 
stands for total revenue and VC stands for variable costs, then the firm’s decision 
can be written as
Shut down if TR , VC.
The firm shuts down if total revenue is less than variable cost. By dividing both 
sides of this inequality by the quantity Q, we can write it as 
Shut down if TR/Q , VC/Q.
The left side of the inequality, TR/Q, is total revenue P × Q divided by quantity 
Q, which is average revenue, most simply expressed as the good’s price, P. The 
right side of the inequality, VC/Q, is average variable cost, AVC. Therefore, the 
firm’s shutdown criterion can be restated as
 Shut down if P , AVC.
That is, a firm chooses to shut down if the price of the good is less than the average 
variable cost of production. This criterion is intuitive: When choosing to produce, 
the firm compares the price it receives for the typical unit to the average variable 
cost that it must incur to produce the typical unit. If the price doesn’t cover the 
average variable cost, the firm is better off stopping production altogether. The 
firm still loses money (because it has to pay fixed costs), but it would lose even 
more money by staying open. The firm can reopen in the future if conditions 
change so that price exceeds average variable cost.
We now have a full description of a competitive firm’s profit-maximizing strat-
egy. If the firm produces anything, it produces the quantity at which marginal 
cost equals the price of the good. Yet if the price is less than average variable cost 
at that quantity, the firm is better off shutting down and not producing anything. 
These results are illustrated in Figure 3. The competitive firm’s short-run supply curve 
is the portion of its marginal-cost curve that lies above average variable cost. 
Spilt Milk and Other Sunk Costs
Sometime in your life you may have been told, “Don’t cry over spilt milk,” or 
“Let bygones be bygones.” These adages hold a deep truth about rational deci-
sion making. Economists say that a cost is a sunk cost when it has already been 
committed and cannot be recovered. Because nothing can be done about sunk 
costs, you can ignore them when making decisions about various aspects of life, 
including business strategy.
Our analysis of the firm’s shutdown decision is one example of the irrelevance 
of sunk costs. We assume that the firm cannot recover its fixed costs by tempo-
rarily stopping production. That is, regardless of the quantity of output supplied 
(even if it is zero), the firm still has to pay its fixed costs. As a result, the fixed 
costs are sunk in the short run, and the firm can ignore them when deciding how 
much to produce. The firm’s short-run supply curve is the part of the marginal-
cost curve that lies above average variable cost, and the size of the fixed cost does 
not matter for this supply decision.

The irrelevance of sunk costs is also important when making personal deci-
sions. Imagine, for instance, that you place a $15 value on seeing a newly released 
movie. You buy a ticket for $10, but before entering the theater, you lose the ticket. 
Should you buy another ticket? Or should you now go home and refuse to pay a 
total of $20 to see the movie? The answer is that you should buy another ticket. 
The benefit of seeing the movie ($15) still exceeds the opportunity cost (the $10 for 
the second ticket). The $10 you paid for the lost ticket is a sunk cost. As with spilt 
milk, there is no point in crying about it.
Near-Empty Restaurants and Off-Season  
Miniature Golf
Have you ever walked into a restaurant for lunch and found it almost empty? 
Why, you might have asked, does the restaurant even bother to stay open? It 
might seem that the revenue from so few customers could not possibly cover the 
cost of running the restaurant.
	
In making the decision whether to open for lunch, a restaurant owner must 
keep in mind the distinction between fixed and variable costs. Many of a 
­restaurant’s costs—the rent, kitchen equipment, tables, plates, silverware, and so 
on—are fixed. Shutting down during lunch would not reduce these costs. In other 
words, these costs are sunk in the short run. When the owner is deciding whether 
to serve lunch, only the variable costs—the price of the additional food and the 
wages of the extra staff—are relevant. The owner shuts down the restaurant at 
lunchtime only if the revenue from the few lunchtime customers fails to cover the 
restaurant’s variable costs.
	
An operator of a miniature-golf course in a summer resort community faces a 
similar decision. Because revenue varies substantially from season to season, the 
firm must decide when to open and when to close. Once again, the fixed costs—
the costs of buying the land and building the course—are irrelevant in making this 
decision. The miniature-golf course should be open for business only during those 
times of year when its revenue exceeds its variable costs.  ■

The Firm’s Long-Run Decision  
to Exit or Enter a Market
A firm’s long-run decision to exit a market is similar to its shutdown decision. 
If the firm exits, it will again lose all revenue from the sale of its product, but 
now it will save not only its variable costs of production but also its fixed costs. 
Thus, the firm exits the market if the revenue it would get from producing is less than 
its total costs.
We can again make this criterion more useful by writing it mathematically. 
If TR stands for total revenue, and TC stands for total cost, then the firm’s exit 
­criterion can be written as
Exit if TR , TC.
The firm exits if total revenue is less than total cost. By dividing both sides of this 
inequality by quantity Q, we can write it as 
Exit if TR/Q , TC/Q.
We can simplify this further by noting that TR/Q is average revenue, which 
equals the price P, and that TC/Q is average total cost, ATC. Therefore, the firm’s 
exit criterion is
Exit if P , ATC.
That is, a firm chooses to exit if the price of its good is less than the average total 
cost of production. 
A parallel analysis applies to an entrepreneur who is considering starting a 
firm. The firm will enter the market if such an action would be profitable, which 
occurs if the price of the good exceeds the average total cost of production. The 
entry criterion is
Enter if P . ATC.
The criterion for entry is exactly the opposite of the criterion for exit. 
We can now describe a competitive firm’s long-run profit-maximizing strat-
egy. If the firm is in the market, it produces the quantity at which marginal cost 
equals the price of the good. Yet if the price is less than the average total cost at 
that quantity, the firm chooses to exit (or not enter) the market. These results are 
illustrated in Figure 4. The competitive firm’s long-run supply curve is the portion of its 
marginal-cost curve that lies above average total cost. 
Measuring Profit in Our Graph  
for the Competitive Firm
As we study exit and entry, it is useful to analyze the firm’s profit in more detail. 
Recall that profit equals total revenue (TR) minus total cost (TC):

But note that TR/Q is average revenue, which is the price, P, and TC/Q is average 
total cost, ATC. Therefore,
Profit 5 (P – ATC) × Q.
This way of expressing the firm’s profit allows us to measure profit in our graphs. 
Panel (a) of Figure 5 shows a firm earning positive profit. As we have already 
discussed, the firm maximizes profit by producing the quantity at which price 
equals marginal cost. Now look at the shaded rectangle. The height of the 
­rectangle is P – ATC, the difference between price and average total cost. The 
width of the rectangle is Q, the quantity produced. Therefore, the area of the rect­
angle is (P – ATC) × Q, which is the firm’s profit. 
Similarly, panel (b) of this figure shows a firm with losses (negative profit). In 
this case, maximizing profit means minimizing losses, a task accomplished once 
again by producing the quantity at which price equals marginal cost. Now con-
sider the shaded rectangle. The height of the rectangle is ATC – P, and the width 
is Q. The area is (ATC – P) × Q, which is the firm’s loss. Because a firm in this 
situation is not making enough revenue to cover its average total cost, the firm 
would choose in the long run to exit the market.

down? When does it decide to exit a market? 
The Supply Curve in a Competitive Market
Now that we have examined the supply decision of a single firm, we can discuss 
the supply curve for a market. There are two cases to consider. First, we examine 
a market with a fixed number of firms. Second, we examine a market in which 
the number of firms can change as old firms exit the market and new firms enter. 
Figure 4
The Competitive Firm’s Long-Run 
Supply Curve
In the long run, the competitive firm’s 
supply curve is its marginal-cost curve 
(MC) above average total cost (ATC). 
If the price falls below average total  
cost, the firm is better off exiting the

Both cases are important, for each applies over a specific time horizon. Over short 
periods of time, it is often difficult for firms to enter and exit, so the assumption of 
a fixed number of firms is appropriate. But over long periods of time, the number 
of firms can adjust to changing market conditions.
The Short Run: Market Supply with  
a Fixed Number of Firms
Consider first a market with 1,000 identical firms. For any given price, each firm 
supplies a quantity of output so that its marginal cost equals the price, as shown 
in panel (a) of Figure 6. That is, as long as price is above average variable cost, 
each firm’s marginal-cost curve is its supply curve. The quantity of output sup-
plied to the market equals the sum of the quantities supplied by each of the 1,000 
individual firms. Thus, to derive the market supply curve, we add the quantity 
supplied by each firm in the market. As panel (b) of Figure 6 shows, because the 
firms are identical, the quantity supplied to the market is 1,000 times the quantity 
supplied by each firm. 
The Long Run: Market Supply with Entry and Exit
Now consider what happens if firms are able to enter or exit the market. Let’s 
suppose that everyone has access to the same technology for producing the good 
and access to the same markets to buy the inputs into production. Therefore, all 
current and potential firms have the same cost curves. 
Decisions about entry and exit in a market of this type depend on the incentives 
facing the owners of existing firms and the entrepreneurs who could start new 
firms. If firms already in the market are profitable, then new firms will have an 
incentive to enter the market. This entry will expand the number of firms, increase

The area of the shaded box between price and average total cost represents the 
firm’s profit. The height of this box is price minus average total cost (P – ATC), 
and the width of the box is the quantity of output (Q). In panel (a), price is above 
average total cost, so the firm has positive profit. In panel (b), price is less than 
average total cost, so the firm has losses.

the quantity of the good supplied, and drive down prices and profits. Conversely, 
if firms in the market are making losses, then some existing firms will exit the 
market. Their exit will reduce the number of firms, decrease the quantity of the 
good supplied, and drive up prices and profits. At the end of this process of entry and 
exit, firms that remain in the market must be making zero economic profit. 
Recall that we can write a firm’s profit as 
Profit 5 (P – ATC) × Q.
This equation shows that an operating firm has zero profit if and only if the price of 
the good equals the average total cost of producing that good. If price is above aver-
age total cost, profit is positive, which encourages new firms to enter. If price is less 
than average total cost, profit is negative, which encourages some firms to exit. The 
process of entry and exit ends only when price and average total cost are driven to equality.
This analysis has a surprising implication. We noted earlier in the chapter that 
competitive firms maximize profits by choosing a quantity at which price equals 
marginal cost. We just noted that free entry and exit force price to equal average 
total cost. But if price is to equal both marginal cost and average total cost, these 
two measures of cost must equal each other. Marginal cost and average total cost 
are equal, however, only when the firm is operating at the minimum of average 
total cost. Recall from the preceding chapter that the level of production with 
lowest average total cost is called the firm’s efficient scale. Therefore, in the long-run 
equilibrium of a competitive market with free entry and exit, firms must be operating at 
their efficient scale.
Panel (a) of Figure 7 shows a firm in such a long-run equilibrium. In this ­figure, 
price P equals marginal cost MC, so the firm is maximizing profits. Price also 
equals average total cost ATC, so profits are zero. New firms have no incentive to 
enter the market, and existing firms have no incentive to leave the market.

In the short run, the number of firms in the market is fixed. As a result, the market 
supply curve, shown in panel (b), reflects the individual firms’ marginal-cost curves, 
shown in panel (a). Here, in a market of 1,000 firms, the quantity of output supplied 
to the market is 1,000 times the quantity supplied by each firm.

## Page 292

From this analysis of firm behavior, we can determine the long-run supply 
curve for the market. In a market with free entry and exit, there is only one price 
consistent with zero profit—the minimum of average total cost. As a result, the 
long-run market supply curve must be horizontal at this price, as illustrated by 
the perfectly elastic supply curve in panel (b) of Figure 7. Any price above this 
level would generate profit, leading to entry and an increase in the total quantity 
supplied. Any price below this level would generate losses, leading to exit and 
a decrease in the total quantity supplied. Eventually, the number of firms in the 
market adjusts so that price equals the minimum of average total cost, and there 
are enough firms to satisfy all the demand at this price.
Why Do Competitive Firms Stay in Business  
If They Make Zero Profit?
At first, it might seem odd that competitive firms earn zero profit in the long run. 
After all, people start businesses to make a profit. If entry eventually drives profit 
to zero, there might seem to be little reason to stay in business.
To understand the zero-profit condition more fully, recall that profit equals 
total revenue minus total cost and that total cost includes all the opportunity costs 
of the firm. In particular, total cost includes the time and money that the firm 
­owners devote to the business. In the zero-profit equilibrium, the firm’s revenue 
must compensate the owners for these opportunity costs.
Consider an example. Suppose that, to start his farm, a farmer had to invest $1 
­million, which otherwise he could have deposited in a bank and earned $50,000 a 
year in interest. In addition, he had to give up another job that would have paid him 
$30,000 a year. Then the farmer’s opportunity cost of farming includes both the ­interest 
Figure 7
Long-Run Market Supply
In the long run, firms will enter or exit the market until profit is driven to zero. 
As a result, price equals the minimum of average total cost, as shown in panel (a). 
The number of firms adjusts to ensure that all demand is satisfied at this price. The 
long-run market supply curve is horizontal at this price, as shown in panel (b).

he could have earned and the forgone wages—a total of $80,000. Even if his profit is 
driven to zero, his revenue from farming compensates him for these opportunity costs.
Keep in mind that accountants and economists measure costs differently. As 
we discussed in the previous chapter, accountants keep track of explicit costs but 
not implicit costs. That is, they measure costs that require an outflow of money 
from the firm, but they do not include the opportunity costs of production that do 
not involve an outflow of money. As a result, in the zero-profit equilibrium, eco-
nomic profit is zero, but accounting profit is positive. Our farmer’s accountant, for 
instance, would conclude that the farmer earned an accounting profit of $80,000, 
which is enough to keep the farmer in business.
A Shift in Demand in the Short Run and Long Run 
Now that we have a more complete understanding of how firms make supply 
decisions, we can better explain how markets respond to changes in demand. 
Because firms can enter and exit in the long run but not in the short run, the 
response of a market to a change in demand depends on the time horizon. To see 
this, let’s trace the effects of a shift in demand over time. 
Suppose the market for milk begins in a long-run equilibrium. Firms are earn-
ing zero profit, so price equals the minimum of average total cost. Panel (a) of 
Figure 8 shows this situation. The long-run equilibrium is point A, the quantity 
sold in the market is Q1, and the price is P1. 
Now suppose scientists discover that milk has miraculous health benefits. As a 
result, the demand curve for milk shifts outward from D1 to D2, as in panel (b). The 
short-run equilibrium moves from point A to point B; as a result, the quantity rises 
from Q1 to Q2, and the price rises from P1 to P2. All of the existing firms respond 
to the higher price by raising the amount produced. Because each firm’s supply 
curve reflects its marginal-cost curve, how much they each increase production 
is determined by the marginal-cost curve. In the new short-run equilibrium, the 
price of milk exceeds average total cost, so the firms are making positive profit.
Over time, the profit generated in this market encourages new firms to enter. 
Some farmers may switch to milk from other farm products, for example. As the 
number of firms grows, the short-run supply curve shifts to the right from S1 to S2, 
as in panel (c), and this shift causes the price of milk to fall. Eventually, the price is 
driven back down to the minimum of average total cost, profits are zero, and firms 
stop entering. Thus, the market reaches a new long-run equilibrium, point C. The 
price of milk has returned to P1, but the quantity produced has risen to Q3. Each 
firm is again producing at its efficient scale, but because more firms are in the dairy 
business, the quantity of milk produced and sold is higher.
Why the Long-Run Supply Curve  
Might Slope Upward
So far, we have seen that entry and exit can cause the long-run market supply curve 
to be perfectly elastic. The essence of our analysis is that there are a large number 
of potential entrants, each of which faces the same costs. As a result, the long-run 
market supply curve is horizontal at the minimum of average total cost. When the 
demand for the good increases, the long-run result is an increase in the number of 
firms and in the total quantity supplied, without any change in the price.
There are, however, two reasons that the long-run market supply curve might 
slope upward. The first is that some resources used in production may be avail-
able only in limited quantities. For example, consider the market for farm products.

Figure 8
An Increase in Demand  
in the Short Run and  
Long Run
The market starts in a long-run equilibrium, shown as point A in panel (a). In this 
equilibrium, each firm makes zero profit, and the price equals the minimum average 
total cost. Panel (b) shows what happens in the short run when demand rises from  
D1 to D2. The equilibrium goes from point A to point B, price rises from P1 to P2, and 
the quantity sold in the market rises from Q1 to Q2. Because price now exceeds average 
total cost, firms make profits, which over time encourage new firms to enter the 
market. This entry shifts the short-run supply curve to the right from S1 to S2, as shown 
in panel (c). In the new long-run equilibrium, point C, price has returned to P1 but the 
quantity sold has increased to Q3. Profits are again zero, price is back to the minimum 
of average total cost, but the market has more firms to satisfy the greater demand.

## Page 295

Anyone can choose to buy land and start a farm, but the quantity of land is 
limited. As more people become farmers, the price of farmland is bid up, which 
raises the costs of all farmers in the market. Thus, an increase in demand for farm 
products cannot induce an increase in quantity supplied without also inducing a 
rise in farmers’ costs, which in turn means a rise in price. The result is a long-run 
market supply curve that is upward sloping, even with free entry into farming.
A second reason for an upward-sloping supply curve is that firms may have 
different costs. For example, consider the market for painters. Anyone can enter 
the market for painting services, but not everyone has the same costs. Costs vary in 
part because some people work faster than others and in part because some people 
have better alternative uses of their time than others. For any given price, those 
with lower costs are more likely to enter than those with higher costs. To increase 
the quantity of painting services supplied, additional entrants must be encouraged 
to enter the market. Because these new entrants have higher costs, the price must 
rise to make entry profitable for them. Thus, the long-run market supply curve for 
painting services slopes upward even with free entry into the market.
Notice that if firms have different costs, some firms earn profit even in the 
long run. In this case, the price in the market reflects the average total cost of the 
marginal firm—the firm that would exit the market if the price were any lower. 
This firm earns zero profit, but firms with lower costs earn positive profit. Entry 
does not eliminate this profit because would-be entrants have higher costs than 
firms already in the market. Higher-cost firms will enter only if the price rises, 
making the market profitable for them.
Thus, for these two reasons, a higher price may be necessary to induce a larger 
quantity supplied, in which case the long-run supply curve is upward sloping 
rather than horizontal. Nonetheless, the basic lesson about entry and exit remains 
true. Because firms can enter and exit more easily in the long run than in the short run, 
the long-run supply curve is typically more elastic than the short-run supply curve.
Quick Quiz  In the long run with free entry and exit, is the price in a market equal 
to marginal cost, average total cost, both, or neither? Explain with a diagram.
Conclusion: Behind the Supply Curve
We have been discussing the behavior of profit-maximizing firms that supply 
goods in perfectly competitive markets. You may recall from Chapter 1 that one 
of the Ten Principles of Economics is that rational people think at the margin. This 
chapter has applied this idea to the competitive firm. Marginal analysis has given 
us a theory of the supply curve in a competitive market and, as a result, a deeper 
understanding of market outcomes. 
We have learned that when you buy a good from a firm in a competitive market, 
you can be assured that the price you pay is close to the cost of producing that good. In 
particular, if firms are competitive and profit maximizing, the price of a good equals 
the marginal cost of making that good. In addition, if firms can freely enter and exit 
the market, the price also equals the lowest possible average total cost of production.
Although we have assumed throughout this chapter that firms are price takers, 
many of the tools developed here are also useful for studying firms in less 
competitive markets. We now turn to an examination of the behavior of firms 
with market power. Marginal analysis will again be useful, but it will have 
quite different implications.

Summary
• Because a competitive firm is a price taker, its 
revenue is proportional to the amount of output 
it produces. The price of the good equals both the 
firm’s average revenue and its marginal revenue.
• To maximize profit, a firm chooses a quantity of 
output such that marginal revenue equals mar-
ginal cost. Because marginal revenue for a com-
petitive firm equals the market price, the firm 
chooses quantity so that price equals marginal 
cost. Thus, the firm’s marginal-cost curve is its 
supply curve.
• In the short run when a firm cannot recover its 
fixed costs, the firm will choose to shut down 
temporarily if the price of the good is less than 
average variable cost. In the long run when the 
firm can recover both fixed and variable costs, it 
will choose to exit if the price is less than average 
total cost.
• In a market with free entry and exit, profits are 
driven to zero in the long run. In this long-run 
equilibrium, all firms produce at the efficient 
scale, price equals the minimum of average total 
cost, and the number of firms adjusts to satisfy 
the quantity demanded at this price. 
• Changes in demand have different effects over 
different time horizons. In the short run, an 
increase in demand raises prices and leads to 
profits, and a decrease in demand lowers prices 
and leads to losses. But if firms can freely enter 
and exit the market, then in the long run, the 
number of firms adjusts to drive the market back 
to the zero-profit equilibrium.

	 7.	 A firm in a competitive market receives $500 in 
total revenue and has marginal revenue of $10. 
What is the average revenue, and how many 
units were sold? 
	 8.	 A profit-maximizing firm in a competitive  
market is currently producing 100 units of  
output. It has average revenue of $10, average 
total cost of $8, and fixed costs of $200. 
a.	 What is its profit?
b.	What is its marginal cost?
c.	 What is its average variable cost?
d.	Is the efficient scale of the firm more than, 
less than, or exactly 100 units?
	 9.	 The market for fertilizer is perfectly competitive. 
Firms in the market are producing output, but 
are currently making economic losses. 
a.	 How does the price of fertilizer compare to 
the average total cost, the average variable 
cost, and the marginal cost of producing  
fertilizer? 
b.	Draw two graphs, side by side, illustrating 
the present situation for the typical firm and 
in the market. 
c.	 Assuming there is no change in either 
demand or the firms’ cost curves, explain 
what will happen in the long run to the price 
of fertilizer, marginal cost, average total cost, 
the quantity supplied by each firm, and the 
total quantity supplied to the market.

a.	 Compute each producer’s total cost and  
average total cost for 1 to 6 pies.
b.	The price of a pie is now $11. How many pies 
are sold? How many pies does each producer 
make? How many producers are there? How 
much profit does each producer earn?
c.	 Is the situation described in part (b) a  
long-run equilibrium? Why or why not?
d.	Suppose that in the long run there is free 
entry and exit. How much profit does each 
producer earn in the long-run equilibrium? 
What is the market price and number of 
pies each producer makes? How many pies 
are sold? How many pie producers are 
operating?
	11.	 Suppose that the U.S. textile industry is  
competitive, and there is no international trade 
in textiles. In long-run equilibrium, the price  
per unit of cloth is $30.
a.	 Describe the equilibrium using graphs for the 
entire market and for an individual producer.
	 	 Now suppose that textile producers in other 
countries are willing to sell large quantities of 
cloth in the United States for only $25 per unit.
b.	Assuming that U.S. textile producers have 
large fixed costs, what is the short-run effect 
of these imports on the quantity produced by 
an individual producer? What is the short-run 
effect on profits? Illustrate your answer with 
a graph.
c.	 What is the long-run effect on the number of 
U.S. firms in the industry?
	12.	 An industry currently has 100 firms, all of 
which have fixed costs of $16 and average  
variable cost as follows:
Quantity	
Average Variable Cost
	
1	
$1
	
2

a.	 Compute marginal cost and average total 
cost.
b.	The price is currently $10. What is the total 
quantity supplied in the market?
c.	 As this market makes the transition to its 
long-run equilibrium, will the price rise or 
fall? Will the quantity demanded rise or fall? 
Will the quantity supplied by each firm rise 
or fall? 
d.	Graph the long-run supply curve for this 
market.
	13.	 Suppose there are 1,000 hot pretzel stands  
operating in New York City. Each stand has the 
usual U-shaped average-total-cost curve. The 
market demand curve for pretzels slopes  
downward, and the market for pretzels is in 
long-run competitive equilibrium.
a.	 Draw the current equilibrium, using graphs 
for the entire market and for an individual 
pretzel stand.
b.	The city decides to restrict the number of 
pretzel-stand licenses, reducing the number 
of stands to only 800. What effect will this 
action have on the market and on an  
individual stand that is still operating? Draw 
graphs to illustrate your answer.
c.	 Suppose that the city decides to charge a fee 
for the 800 licenses, all of which are quickly 
sold. How will the size of the fee affect the 
number of pretzels sold by an individual 
stand? How will it affect the price of pretzels 
in the city?
d.	The city wants to raise as much revenue as 
possible, while ensuring that all 800 licenses 
are sold. How high should the city set the 
license fee? Show the answer on your 
graph.
