f you go to a store to buy tennis balls, you will probably come home with 
one of four brands: Wilson, Penn, Dunlop, or Spalding. These four compa­
nies make almost all the tennis balls sold in the United States. Together these 
firms determine the quantity of tennis balls produced and, given the market 
demand curve, the price at which tennis balls are sold.
The market for tennis balls is an example of an oligopoly. The essence of an 
oligopolistic market is that there are only a few sellers. As a result, the actions of 
any one seller in the market can have a large impact on the profits of all the other 
sellers. Oligopolistic firms are interdependent in a way that competitive firms are 
not. Our goal in this chapter is to see how this interdependence shapes the firms’ 
behavior and what problems it raises for public policy.
The analysis of oligopoly offers an opportunity to introduce game theory, the 
study of how people behave in strategic situations. By “strategic” we mean a situa­
tion in which a person, when choosing among alternative courses of action, must

consider how others might respond to the action he takes. Strategic thinking is 
crucial not only in checkers, chess, and tic-tac-toe but in many business decisions. 
Because oligopolistic markets have only a small number of firms, each firm must 
act strategically. Each firm knows that its profit depends not only on how much it 
produces but also on how much the other firms produce. In making its production 
decision, each firm in an oligopoly should consider how its decision might affect 
the production decisions of all the other firms.
Game theory is not necessary for understanding competitive or monopoly 
markets. In a market that is either perfectly competitive or monopolistically 
competitive, each firm is so small compared to the market that strategic inter­
actions with other firms are not important. In a monopolized market, strategic 
interactions are absent because the market has only one firm. But, as we will see, 
game theory is useful for understanding oligopolies and many other situations 
in which a small number of players interact with one another. Game theory helps 
explain the strategies that people choose, whether they are playing tennis or selling 
tennis balls.
Markets with Only a Few Sellers
Because an oligopolistic market has only a small group of sellers, a key feature 
of oligopoly is the tension between cooperation and self-interest. The oligopolists 
are best off when they cooperate and act like a monopolist—producing a small 
quantity of output and charging a price above marginal cost. Yet because each 
oligopolist cares only about its own profit, there are powerful incentives at work 
that hinder a group of firms from maintaining the cooperative outcome. 
A Duopoly Example
To understand the behavior of oligopolies, let’s consider an oligopoly with 
only two members, called a duopoly. Duopoly is the simplest type of oligopoly. 
Oligopolies with three or more members face the same problems as duopolies, so 
we do not lose much by starting with the simpler case.
Imagine a town in which only two residents—Jack and Jill—own wells that 
produce water safe for drinking. Each Saturday, Jack and Jill decide how many 
gallons of water to pump, bring the water to town, and sell it for whatever price 
the market will bear. To keep things simple, suppose that Jack and Jill can pump 
as much water as they want without cost. That is, the marginal cost of water 
equals zero.
Table 1 shows the town’s demand schedule for water. The first column shows 
the total quantity demanded, and the second column shows the price. If the two 
well owners sell a total of 10 gallons of water, water goes for $110 a gallon. If they 
sell a total of 20 gallons, the price falls to $100 a gallon. And so on. If you graphed 
these two columns of numbers, you would get a standard downward-sloping 
demand curve.
The last column in Table 1 shows the total revenue from the sale of water. 
It equals the quantity sold times the price. Because there is no cost to pumping 
water, the total revenue of the two producers equals their total profit.
Let’s now consider how the organization of the town’s water industry affects 
the price of water and the quantity of water sold.

CHAPTER 17    Oligopoly
Competition, Monopolies, and Cartels
Before considering the price and quantity of water that would result from the 
duopoly of Jack and Jill, let’s discuss briefly what the outcome would be if the 
water market were either perfectly competitive or monopolistic. These two polar 
cases are natural benchmarks. 
If the market for water were perfectly competitive, the production decisions 
of each firm would drive price equal to marginal cost. Because we have assumed 
that the marginal cost of pumping additional water is zero, the equilibrium price 
of water under perfect competition would be zero as well. The equilibrium quan­
tity would be 120 gallons. The price of water would reflect the cost of producing 
it, and the efficient quantity of water would be produced and consumed.
Now consider how a monopoly would behave. Table 1 shows that total profit 
is maximized at a quantity of 60 gallons and a price of $60 a gallon. A profit-
maximizing monopolist, therefore, would produce this quantity and charge this 
price. As is standard for monopolies, price would exceed marginal cost. The result 
would be inefficient, because the quantity of water produced and consumed 
would fall short of the socially efficient level of 120 gallons.
What outcome should we expect from our duopolists? One possibility is that 
Jack and Jill get together and agree on the quantity of water to produce and the 
price to charge for it. Such an agreement among firms over production and price 
is called collusion, and the group of firms acting in unison is called a cartel. Once 
a cartel is formed, the market is in effect served by a monopoly, and we can apply 
our analysis from Chapter 15. That is, if Jack and Jill were to collude, they would 
agree on the monopoly outcome because that outcome maximizes the total profit 
that the producers can get from the market. Our two producers would produce 
a total of 60 gallons, which would be sold at a price of $60 a gallon. Once again, 
price exceeds marginal cost, and the outcome is socially inefficient.
A cartel must agree not only on the total level of production but also on the 
amount produced by each member. In our case, Jack and Jill must agree on how to

split the monopoly production of 60 gallons. Each member of the cartel will want 
a larger share of the market because a larger market share means larger profit. If 
Jack and Jill agreed to split the market equally, each would produce 30 gallons, the 
price would be $60 a gallon, and each would get a profit of $1,800.
 Public Price Fixing
If a group of producers coordinates their prices in secret meetings, they 
can be sent to jail for criminal violations of antitrust laws. But what if 
they discuss the same topic in public?

Market Talk
By Alistair Lindsay
M
ost companies have antitrust com-
pliance policies. They typically—and 
quite rightly—identify a number of things 
that officers and employees should not do, 
on pain of criminal liability, eye-watering 
fines and unlimited damages actions. All 
make clear that companies must not agree 
with their competitors to fix prices. This is a 
bright-line rule. But it raises an important 
question: Can companies coordinate price 
increases without infringing the cartel rules?
	
In markets where competitors need to 
publish their prices to win business—for 
example, many retail markets—it is per-
fectly lawful to shadow a rival’s increases, 
so long as each seller acts entirely indepen-
dently in setting its charges. The very defini-
tion of an oligopoly is a market involving 
a small number of suppliers that set their 
own commercial strategies but take account 
of their competitors. One competitor may 
emerge as a leader, with others taking their 
cue on when to raise prices and by how 
much.
	
When prices are privately negotiated—
as in many industrials markets—it is com-
mon for a customer to volunteer information 
about a rival’s prices to obtain leverage: 
“You’ve quoted £100 per ton, but X is offer-
ing £95 and I’m going to them unless you 
can do better.” A company that receives this 
information obtains valuable intelligence 
about what its rivals are charging, but it 
does not infringe cartel rules. . . .
	
Companies also sometimes signal to one 
another in their communications with inves-
tors, whether deliberately or not. A com-
petitor which informs the markets, say, that 
it expects a price war to end in February is 
providing relevant information to actual and 
potential owners of its stock. But of course its 
rivals read the same reports and can change 
their strategies accordingly. So a statement 
to the market can serve as just as much of 
a signal to competitors as a statement made 
during a cartel meeting. . . .
	
Signaling through investor communica-
tions raises difficult questions for cartel 
enforcement. The enforcers want to pro-
tect consumers from the adverse effects of 
blatant signaling, but not at the price of 
losing transparency in financial markets. For 
example, it is highly relevant to an investor 
to know an airline’s predicted growth of per-
mile passenger revenue for the next quarter. 
But a rival airline might use the announced 
figure as a benchmark when setting its own 
fares for the next quarter.
	
As things stand, cartel authorities have 
focused their efforts in such situations on 
blocking mergers in markets where signal-
ing is prevalent, arguing that consolidation 
in such markets can further dampen compe-
tition by making coordination easier or more 
successful. However, they have not taken 
high-profile action alleging cartel infringe-
ments against companies for announce-
ments made to investors.
	
If there is no justification for a par-
ticular announcement other than to signal 
to competitors, cartel authorities should seek 
to intervene. For in this case the public 
announcement is analytically the same as a 
private discussion directly with the rivals, and 
there is scope for consumers to be seriously 
harmed. But most announcements do serve 
legitimate purposes, such as keeping inves-
tors informed. In these cases, intervention 
by the cartel authorities seems too complex, 
given the disparate policy objectives in play.

CHAPTER 17    Oligopoly
The Equilibrium for an Oligopoly
Oligopolists would like to form cartels and earn monopoly profits, but that is 
often impossible. Squabbling among cartel members over how to divide the profit 
in the market can make agreement among members difficult. In addition, antitrust 
laws prohibit explicit agreements among oligopolists as a matter of public policy. 
Even talking about pricing and production restrictions with competitors can be 
a criminal offense. Let’s therefore consider what happens if Jack and Jill decide 
separately how much water to produce.
At first, one might expect Jack and Jill to reach the monopoly outcome on their 
own, because this outcome maximizes their joint profit. In the absence of a bind­
ing agreement, however, the monopoly outcome is unlikely. To see why, imagine 
that Jack expects Jill to produce only 30 gallons (half of the monopoly quantity). 
Jack would reason as follows:
"I could produce 30 gallons as well. In this case, a total of 60 gallons of water 
would be sold at a price of $60 a gallon. My profit would be $1,800 (30 gallons × 
$60 a gallon). Alternatively, I could produce 40 gallons. In this case, a total of 70 
gallons of water would be sold at a price of $50 a gallon. My profit would be $2,000 
(40 gallons × $50 a gallon). Even though total profit in the market would fall, my 
profit would be higher, because I would have a larger share of the market."
Of course, Jill might reason the same way. If so, Jack and Jill would each bring 
40 gallons to town. Total sales would be 80 gallons, and the price would fall to $40. 
Thus, if the duopolists individually pursue their own self-interest when deciding 
how much to produce, they produce a total quantity greater than the monopoly 
quantity, charge a price lower than the monopoly price, and earn total profit less 
than the monopoly profit.
Although the logic of self-interest increases the duopoly’s output above the 
monopoly level, it does not push the duopolists to reach the competitive alloca­
tion. Consider what happens when each duopolist is producing 40 gallons. The 
price is $40, and each duopolist makes a profit of $1,600. In this case, Jack’s self-
interested logic leads to a different conclusion:
“Right now, my profit is $1,600. Suppose I increase my production to 50 gallons. 
In this case, a total of 90 gallons of water would be sold, and the price would be 
$30 a gallon. Then my profit would be only $1,500. Rather than increasing pro­
duction and driving down the price, I am better off keeping my production at 
40 gallons.”
The outcome in which Jack and Jill each produce 40 gallons looks like some 
sort of equilibrium. In fact, this outcome is called a Nash equilibrium. (It is named 
after economic theorist John Nash, whose life was portrayed in the book and 
movie A Beautiful Mind.) A Nash equilibrium is a situation in which economic 
actors interacting with one another each choose their best strategy given the 
strate­gies the others have chosen. In this case, given that Jill is producing 40 gal­
lons, the best strategy for Jack is to produce 40 gallons. Similarly, given that Jack 
is producing 40 gallons, the best strategy for Jill is to produce 40 gallons. Once 
they reach this Nash equilibrium, neither Jack nor Jill has an incentive to make a 
different decision.
This example illustrates the tension between cooperation and self-interest. 
Oligopolists would be better off cooperating and reaching the monopoly outcome. 
Yet because they pursue their own self-interest, they do not end up reaching the 
monopoly outcome and maximizing their joint profit. Each oligopolist is tempted 
to raise production and capture a larger share of the market. As each of them tries 
to do this, total production rises, and the price falls.

Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
At the same time, self-interest does not drive the market all the way to the 
competitive outcome. Like monopolists, oligopolists are aware that increasing 
the amount they produce reduces the price of their product, which in turn affects 
profits. Therefore, they stop short of following the competitive firm’s rule of pro­
ducing up to the point where price equals marginal cost.
In summary, when firms in an oligopoly individually choose production to maximize 
profit, they produce a quantity of output greater than the level produced by monopoly and 
less than the level produced by competition. The oligopoly price is less than the monopoly 
price but greater than the competitive price (which equals marginal cost).
How the Size of an Oligopoly Affects  
the Market Outcome 
We can use the insights from this analysis of duopoly to discuss how the size of 
an oligopoly is likely to affect the outcome in a market. Suppose, for instance, 
that John and Joan suddenly discover water sources on their property and join 
Jack and Jill in the water oligopoly. The demand schedule in Table 1 remains the 
same, but now more producers are available to satisfy this demand. How would 
an increase in the number of sellers from two to four affect the price and quantity 
of water in the town?
If the sellers of water could form a cartel, they would once again try to maxi­
mize total profit by producing the monopoly quantity and charging the monopoly 
price. Just as when there were only two sellers, the members of the cartel would 
need to agree on production levels for each member and find some way to enforce 
the agreement. As the cartel grows larger, however, this outcome is less likely. 
Reaching and enforcing an agreement becomes more difficult as the size of the 
group increases. 
If the oligopolists do not form a cartel—perhaps because the antitrust laws pro­
hibit it—they must each decide on their own how much water to produce. To see 
how the increase in the number of sellers affects the outcome, consider the deci­
sion facing each seller. At any time, each well owner has the option to raise pro­
duction by one gallon. In making this decision, the well owner weighs two effects:
• 	 The output effect: Because price is above marginal cost, selling one more 
gallon of water at the going price will raise profit.
• 	 The price effect: Raising production will increase the total amount sold, which 
will lower the price of water and lower the profit on all the other gallons 
sold.
If the output effect is larger than the price effect, the well owner will increase pro­
duction. If the price effect is larger than the output effect, the owner will not raise 
production. (In fact, in this case, it is profitable to reduce production.) Each oli­
gopolist continues to increase production until these two marginal effects exactly 
balance, taking the other firms’ production as given.
Now consider how the number of firms in the industry affects the marginal 
analysis of each oligopolist. The larger the number of sellers, the less each seller 
is concerned about its own impact on the market price. That is, as the oligopoly 
grows in size, the magnitude of the price effect falls. When the oligopoly grows 
very large, the price effect disappears altogether. That is, the production decision 
of an individual firm no longer affects the market price. In this extreme case, each 
firm takes the market price as given when deciding how much to produce. It 
increases production as long as price is above marginal cost.

CHAPTER 17    Oligopoly
We can now see that a large oligopoly is essentially a group of competitive 
firms. A competitive firm considers only the output effect when deciding how 
much to produce: Because a competitive firm is a price taker, the price effect is 
absent. Thus, as the number of sellers in an oligopoly grows larger, an oligopolistic mar-
ket looks more and more like a competitive market. The price approaches marginal cost, 
and the quantity produced approaches the socially efficient level.
This analysis of oligopoly offers a new perspective on the effects of interna­
tional trade. Imagine that Toyota and Honda are the only automakers in Japan, 
Volkswagen and BMW are the only automakers in Germany, and Ford and 
General Motors are the only automakers in the United States. If these nations pro­
hibited international trade in autos, each would have an auto oligopoly with only 
two members, and the market outcome would likely depart substantially from the 
competitive ideal. With international trade, however, the car market is a world 
market, and the oligopoly in this example has six members. Allowing free trade 
increases the number of producers from which each consumer can choose, and 
this increased competition keeps prices closer to marginal cost. Thus, the theory 
of oligopoly provides another reason, in addition to the theory of comparative 
advantage discussed in Chapter 3, why all countries can benefit from free trade.
Quick Quiz  If the members of an oligopoly could agree on a total quantity to pro-
duce, what quantity would they choose? • If the oligopolists do not act together but 
instead make production decisions individually, do they produce a total quantity more 
or less than in your answer to the previous question? Why?
The Economics of Cooperation
As we have seen, oligopolies would like to reach the monopoly outcome, but 
doing so requires cooperation, which at times is difficult to establish and maintain. 
In this section we look more closely at the problems that arise when cooperation 
among actors is desirable but difficult. To analyze the economics of cooperation, 
we need to learn a little about game theory.
In particular, we focus on an important “game” called the prisoners’ dilemma. 
This game provides insight into why cooperation is difficult. Many times in life, 
people fail to cooperate with one another even when cooperation would make 
them all better off. An oligopoly is just one example. The story of the prisoners’ 
dilemma contains a general lesson that applies to any group trying to maintain 
cooperation among its members.
The Prisoners’ Dilemma 
The prisoners’ dilemma is a story about two criminals who have been captured by 
the police. Let’s call them Bonnie and Clyde. The police have enough evidence to 
convict Bonnie and Clyde of the minor crime of carrying an unregistered gun, so 
that each would spend a year in jail. The police also suspect that the two criminals 
have committed a bank robbery together, but they lack hard evidence to convict 
them of this major crime. The police question Bonnie and Clyde in separate 
rooms, and they offer each of them the following deal:
“Right now, we can lock you up for 1 year. If you confess to the bank robbery 
and implicate your partner, however, we’ll give you immunity and you can go 
free. Your partner will get 20 years in jail. But if you both confess to the crime, we

won’t need your testimony and we can avoid the cost of a trial, so you will each 
get an intermediate sentence of 8 years.”
If Bonnie and Clyde, heartless bank robbers that they are, care only about their 
own sentences, what would you expect them to do? Figure 1 shows their choices. 
Each prisoner has two strategies: confess or remain silent. The sentence each pris­
oner gets depends on the strategy he or she chooses and the strategy chosen by 
his or her partner in crime. 
Consider first Bonnie’s decision. She reasons as follows: “I don’t know what 
Clyde is going to do. If he remains silent, my best strategy is to confess, since then 
I’ll go free rather than spending a year in jail. If he confesses, my best strategy is 
still to confess, since then I’ll spend 8 years in jail rather than 20. So, regardless of 
what Clyde does, I am better off confessing.”
In the language of game theory, a strategy is called a dominant strategy if 
it is the best strategy for a player to follow regardless of the strategies pursued 
by other players. In this case, confessing is a dominant strategy for Bonnie. She 
spends less time in jail if she confesses, regardless of whether Clyde confesses or 
remains silent.
Now consider Clyde’s decision. He faces the same choices as Bonnie, and he 
reasons in much the same way. Regardless of what Bonnie does, Clyde can reduce 
his jail time by confessing. In other words, confessing is also a dominant strategy 
for Clyde.
In the end, both Bonnie and Clyde confess, and both spend 8 years in jail. Yet, 
from their standpoint, this is a terrible outcome. If they had both remained silent, 
both of them would have been better off, spending only 1 year in jail on the gun 
charge. Because each pursues his or her own interests, the two prisoners together 
reach an outcome that is worse for each of them.
You might have thought that Bonnie and Clyde would have foreseen this 
situation and planned ahead. But even with advanced planning, they would still 
run into problems. Imagine that, before the police captured Bonnie and Clyde, 
the two criminals had made a pact not to confess. Clearly, this agreement would 
make them both better off if they both lived up to it, because they would each 
spend only 1 year in jail. But would the two criminals in fact remain silent, simply 
because they had agreed to? Once they are being questioned separately, the logic

of self-interest takes over and leads them to confess. Cooperation between the two 
prisoners is difficult to maintain, because cooperation is individually irrational.
Oligopolies as a Prisoners’ Dilemma
What does the prisoners’ dilemma have to do with markets and imperfect compe­
tition? It turns out that the game oligopolists play in trying to reach the monopoly 
outcome is similar to the game that the two prisoners play in the prisoners’ 
dilemma.
Consider again the choices facing Jack and Jill. After prolonged negotiation, the 
two suppliers of water agree to keep production at 30 gallons, so that the price will 
be kept high and together they will earn the maximum profit. After they agree on 
production levels, however, each of them must decide whether to cooperate and 
live up to this agreement or to ignore it and produce at a higher level. Figure 2 
shows how the profits of the two producers depend on the strategies they choose.
Suppose you are Jack. You might reason as follows: “I could keep production 
low at 30 gallons as we agreed, or I could raise my production and sell 40 gallons. 
If Jill lives up to the agreement and keeps her production at 30 gallons, then I earn 
profit of $2,000 with high production and $1,800 with low production. In this case, 
I am better off with high production. If Jill fails to live up to the agreement and 
produces 40 gallons, then I earn $1,600 with high production and $1,500 with low 
production. Once again, I am better off with high production. So, regardless of 
what Jill chooses to do, I am better off reneging on our agreement and producing 
at a high level.”
Producing 40 gallons is a dominant strategy for Jack. Of course, Jill reasons in 
exactly the same way, and so both produce at the higher level of 40 gallons. The 
result is the inferior outcome (from Jack and Jill’s standpoint) with low profits for 
each of the two producers.
This example illustrates why oligopolies have trouble maintaining monopoly 
profits. The monopoly outcome is jointly rational for the oligopoly, but each oli­
gopolist has an incentive to cheat. Just as self-interest drives the prisoners in the 
prisoners’ dilemma to confess, self-interest makes it difficult for the oligopoly to 
maintain the cooperative outcome with low production, high prices, and monopoly 
profits.

OPEC and the World Oil Market 
Our story about the town’s market for water is fictional, but if we change water to 
crude oil, and Jack and Jill to Iran and Iraq, the story is close to being true. Much 
of the world’s oil is produced by a few countries, mostly in the Middle East. These 
countries together make up an oligopoly. Their decisions about how much oil to 
pump are much the same as Jack and Jill’s decisions about how much water to pump.
	
The countries that produce most of the world’s oil have formed a cartel, called 
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). As originally formed 
in 1960, OPEC included Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. By 
1973, eight other nations had joined: Qatar, Indonesia, Libya, the United Arab 
Emirates, Algeria, Nigeria, Ecuador, and Gabon. These countries control about 
three-fourths of the world’s oil reserves. Like any cartel, OPEC tries to raise the 
price of its product through a coordinated reduction in quantity produced. OPEC 
tries to set production levels for each of the member countries.
	
The problem that OPEC faces is much the same as the problem that Jack and Jill 
face in our story. The OPEC countries would like to maintain a high price for oil. 
But each member of the cartel is tempted to increase its production to get a larger 
share of the total profit. OPEC members frequently agree to reduce production 
but then cheat on their agreements. 
	
OPEC was most successful at maintaining cooperation and high prices in the 
period from 1973 to 1985. The price of crude oil rose from $3 a barrel in 1972 to 
$11 in 1974 and then to $35 in 1981. But in the mid-1980s, member countries began 
arguing about production levels, and OPEC became ineffective at maintaining 
cooperation. By 1986 the price of crude oil had fallen back to $13 a barrel. 
	
In recent years, the members of OPEC have continued to meet regularly, 
but the cartel has been less successful at reaching and enforcing agreements. 
Although the price of oil rose significantly in 2007 and 2008, the primary cause 
was increased demand in the world oil market, in part from a booming Chinese 
economy, rather than restricted supply. While this lack of cooperation among 
OPEC nations has reduced the profits of the oil-producing nations below what 
they might have been, it has benefited consumers around the world.  ■
Other Examples of the Prisoners’ Dilemma
We have seen how the prisoners’ dilemma can be used to understand the problem 
facing oligopolies. The same logic applies to many other situations as well. Here 
we consider two examples in which self-interest prevents cooperation and leads 
to an inferior outcome for the parties involved.
Arms Races  In the decades after World War II, the world’s two superpowers—
the United States and the Soviet Union—were engaged in a prolonged competi­
tion over military power. This topic motivated some of the early work on game 
theory. The game theorists pointed out that an arms race is much like the prison­
ers’ dilemma. 
To see why, consider the decisions of the United States and the Soviet Union 
about whether to build new weapons or to disarm. Each country prefers to have 
more arms than the other because a larger arsenal would give it more influence in 
world affairs. But each country also prefers to live in a world safe from the other 
country’s weapons.

CHAPTER 17    Oligopoly
Figure 3 shows the deadly game. If the Soviet Union chooses to arm, the United 
States is better off doing the same to prevent the loss of power. If the Soviet Union 
chooses to disarm, the United States is better off arming because doing so would 
make it more powerful. For each country, arming is a dominant strategy. Thus, 
each country chooses to continue the arms race, resulting in the inferior outcome 
with both countries at risk.
Throughout the era of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union 
attempted to solve this problem through negotiation and agreements over arms 
control. The problems that the two countries faced were similar to those that 
oligopolists encounter in trying to maintain a cartel. Just as oligopolists argue 
over production levels, the United States and the Soviet Union argued over the 
amount of arms that each country would be allowed. And just as cartels have 
trouble enforcing production levels, the United States and the Soviet Union each 
feared that the other country would cheat on any agreement. In both arms races 
and oligopolies, the relentless logic of self-interest drives the participants toward 
a noncooperative outcome that is worse for each party.
Common Resources  In Chapter 11 we saw that people tend to overuse 
common resources. One can view this problem as an example of the prisoners’ 
dilemma.
Imagine that two oil companies—Exxon and Texaco—own adjacent oil fields. 
Under the fields is a common pool of oil worth $12 million. Drilling a well to 
recover the oil costs $1 million. If each company drills one well, each will get half 
of the oil and earn a $5 million profit ($6 million in revenue minus $1 million in 
costs).
Because the pool of oil is a common resource, the companies will not use it 
efficiently. Suppose that either company could drill a second well. If one company 
has two of the three wells, that company gets two-thirds of the oil, which yields 
a profit of $6 million. The other company gets one-third of the oil, for a profit of 
$3 million. Yet if each company drills a second well, the two companies again split 
the oil. In this case, each bears the cost of a second well, so profit is only $4 million 
for each company.

countries, the safety and 
power of each country

whether to arm and the 
decision made by the other 
country.

Figure 4 shows the game. Drilling two wells is a dominant strategy for each 
company. Once again, the self-interest of the two players leads them to an inferior 
outcome.
The Prisoners’ Dilemma and the Welfare of Society
The prisoners’ dilemma describes many of life’s situations, and it shows that 
cooperation can be difficult to maintain, even when cooperation would make 
both players in the game better off. Clearly, this lack of cooperation is a problem 
for those involved in these situations. But is lack of cooperation a problem from 
the standpoint of society as a whole? The answer depends on the circumstances.
In some cases, the noncooperative equilibrium is bad for society as well as the 
players. In the arms-race game in Figure 3, both the United States and the Soviet 
Union end up at risk. In the common-resources game in Figure 4, the extra wells 
dug by Texaco and Exxon are pure waste. In both cases, society would be better 
off if the two players could reach the cooperative outcome.
By contrast, in the case of oligopolists trying to maintain monopoly profits, 
lack of cooperation is desirable from the standpoint of society as a whole. The 
monopoly outcome is good for the oligopolists, but it is bad for the consumers 
of the product. As we first saw in Chapter 7, the competitive outcome is best for 
society because it maximizes total surplus. When oligopolists fail to cooperate, 
the quantity they produce is closer to this optimal level. Put differently, the invisi­
ble hand guides markets to allocate resources efficiently only when markets are 
competitive, and markets are competitive only when firms in the market fail to 
cooperate with one another.
Similarly, consider the case of the police questioning two suspects. Lack of 
cooperation between the suspects is desirable, for it allows the police to convict 
more criminals. The prisoners’ dilemma is a dilemma for the prisoners, but it can 
be a boon to everyone else. 
Why People Sometimes Cooperate
The prisoners’ dilemma shows that cooperation is difficult. But is it impossible? 
Not all prisoners, when questioned by the police, decide to turn in their partners 
in crime. Cartels sometimes manage to maintain collusive arrangements, despite

CHAPTER 17    Oligopoly
the incentive for individual members to defect. Very often, players can solve the 
prisoners’ dilemma because they play the game not once but many times.
To see why cooperation is easier to enforce in repeated games, let’s return to 
our duopolists, Jack and Jill, whose choices were given in Figure 2. Jack and Jill 
would like to agree to maintain the monopoly outcome in which each produces 
30 gallons. Yet, if Jack and Jill are to play this game only once, neither has any 
incentive to live up to this agreement. Self-interest drives each of them to renege 
and choose the dominant strategy of 40 gallons.
Now suppose that Jack and Jill know that they will play the same game every 
week. When they make their initial agreement to keep production low, they can 
also specify what happens if one party reneges. They might agree, for instance, 
that once one of them reneges and produces 40 gallons, both of them will produce 
40 gallons forever after. This penalty is easy to enforce, for if one party is produc­
ing at a high level, the other has every reason to do the same. 
The threat of this penalty may be all that is needed to maintain cooperation. Each 
person knows that defecting would raise his or her profit from $1,800 to $2,000. But 
this benefit would last for only one week. Thereafter, profit would fall to $1,600 and 
stay there. As long as the players care enough about future profits, they will choose 
to forgo the one-time gain from defection. Thus, in a game of repeated prisoners’ 
dilemma, the two players may well be able to reach the cooperative outcome.
The Prisoners’ Dilemma Tournament
Imagine that you are playing a game of prisoners’ dilemma with a person being 
“questioned” in a separate room. Moreover, imagine that you are going to play 
not once but many times. Your score at the end of the game is the total number of 
years in jail. You would like to make this score as small as possible. What strategy 
would you play? Would you begin by confessing or remaining silent? How would 
the other player’s actions affect your subsequent decisions about confessing?
	
Repeated prisoners’ dilemma is quite a complicated game. To encourage coop­
eration, players must penalize each other for not cooperating. Yet the strategy 
described earlier for Jack and Jill’s water cartel—defect forever as soon as the 
other player defects—is not very forgiving. In a game repeated many times, a 
strategy that allows players to return to the cooperative outcome after a period of 
noncooperation may be preferable.
	
To see what strategies work best, political scientist Robert Axelrod held a tour­
nament. People entered by sending computer programs designed to play repeated 
prisoners’ dilemma. Each program then played the game against all the other pro­
grams. The “winner” was the program that received the fewest total years in jail.
	
The winner turned out to be a simple strategy called tit-for-tat. According to 
tit-for-tat, a player should start by cooperating and then do whatever the other 
player did last time. Thus, a tit-for-tat player cooperates until the other player 
defects; then she defects until the other player cooperates again. In other words, 
this strategy starts out friendly, penalizes unfriendly players, and forgives them if 
warranted. To Axelrod’s surprise, this simple strategy did better than all the more 
complicated strategies that people had sent in. 
	
The tit-for-tat strategy has a long history. It is essentially the biblical strategy of 
“an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.” The prisoners’ dilemma tournament sug­
gests that this may be a good rule of thumb for playing some of the games of life.  ■

Quick Quiz  Tell the story of the prisoners’ dilemma. Write down a table showing 
the prisoners’ choices and explain what outcome is likely. • What does the prisoners’ 
dilemma teach us about oligopolies?
Public Policy toward Oligopolies
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that governments can some­
times improve market outcomes. This principle applies directly to oligopolistic 
markets. As we have seen, cooperation among oligopolists is undesirable from the 
standpoint of society as a whole, because it leads to production that is too low and 
prices that are too high. To move the allocation of resources closer to the social 
optimum, policymakers should try to induce firms in an oligopoly to compete 
rather than cooperate. Let’s consider how policymakers do this and then examine 
the controversies that arise in this area of public policy.
Restraint of Trade and the Antitrust Laws
One way that policy discourages cooperation is through the common law. 
Normally, freedom of contract is an essential part of a market economy. Businesses 
and households use contracts to arrange mutually advantageous trades. In doing 
this, they rely on the court system to enforce contracts. Yet, for many centuries, 
judges in England and the United States have deemed agreements among com­
petitors to reduce quantities and raise prices to be contrary to the public good. 
They have therefore refused to enforce such agreements.
The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 codified and reinforced this policy:
Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, 
in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign 
nations, is declared to be illegal. . . . Every person who shall monopolize, or 
attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any person or persons to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or 
with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on convic­
tion thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, or 
by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the 
discretion of the court.
The Sherman Act elevated agreements among oligopolists from an unenforceable 
contract to a criminal conspiracy. 
The Clayton Act of 1914 further strengthened the antitrust laws. According to 
this law, if a person could prove that he was damaged by an illegal arrangement 
to restrain trade, that person could sue and recover three times the damages he 
sustained. The purpose of this unusual rule of triple damages is to encourage 
private lawsuits against conspiring oligopolists. 
Today, both the U.S. Justice Department and private parties have the authority 
to bring legal suits to enforce the antitrust laws. As we discussed in Chapter 15, 
these laws are used to prevent mergers that would lead to excessive market power 
in any single firm. In addition, these laws are used to prevent oligopolists from 
acting together in ways that would make their markets less competitive.

CHAPTER 17    Oligopoly
An Illegal Phone Call
Firms in oligopolies have a strong incentive to collude in order to reduce produc­
tion, raise price, and increase profit. The great 18th-century economist Adam 
Smith was well aware of this potential market failure. In The Wealth of Nations he 
wrote, “People of the same trade seldom meet together, but the conversation ends 
in a conspiracy against the public, or in some diversion to raise prices.” 
	
To see a modern example of Smith’s observation, consider the following excerpt 
of a phone conversation between two airline executives in the early 1980s. The call 
was reported in the New York Times on February 24, 1983. Robert Crandall was 
president of American Airlines, and Howard Putnam was president of Braniff 
Airways.
	Crandall:	 I think it’s dumb as hell . . . to sit here and pound the @#$% out of 
each other and neither one of us making a #$%& dime.
	 Putnam:	 Do you have a suggestion for me?
	Crandall:	 Yes, I have a suggestion for you. Raise your $%*& fares 20 percent. 
I’ll raise mine the next morning.
	 Putnam:	 Robert, we . . . 
	Crandall:	 You’ll make more money, and I will, too.
	 Putnam:	 We can’t talk about pricing!
	Crandall:	 Oh @#$%, Howard. We can talk about any &*#@ thing we want to 
talk about.
Putnam was right: The Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits competing executives 
from even talking about fixing prices. When Putnam gave a tape of this con­
versation to the Justice Department, the Justice Department filed suit against 
Crandall. 
Two years later, Crandall and the Justice Department reached a settlement in 
which Crandall agreed to various restrictions on his business activities, includ­
ing his contacts with officials at other airlines. The Justice Department said that 
the terms of settlement would “protect competition in the airline industry, by 
preventing American and Crandall from any further attempts to monopolize pas­
senger airline service on any route through discussions with competitors about 
the prices of airline services.”  ■
Controversies over Antitrust Policy
Over time, much controversy has centered on what kinds of behavior the antitrust 
laws should prohibit. Most commentators agree that price-fixing agreements 
among competing firms should be illegal. Yet the antitrust laws have been used 
to condemn some business practices whose effects are not obvious. Here we con­
sider three examples.
Resale Price Maintenance  One example of a controversial business practice 
is resale price maintenance. Imagine that Superduper Electronics sells DVD players 
to retail stores for $300. If Superduper requires the retailers to charge customers 
$350, it is said to engage in resale price maintenance. Any retailer that charged less 
than $350 would violate its contract with Superduper.

Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
At first, resale price maintenance might seem anticompetitive and, therefore, 
detrimental to society. Like an agreement among members of a cartel, it prevents 
the retailers from competing on price. For this reason, the courts have at times 
viewed resale price maintenance as a violation of the antitrust laws.
Yet some economists defend resale price maintenance on two grounds. First, 
they deny that it is aimed at reducing competition. To the extent that Superduper 
Electronics has any market power, it can exert that power through the wholesale 
price, rather than through resale price maintenance. Moreover, Superduper has 
no incentive to discourage competition among its retailers. Indeed, because a car­
tel of retailers sells less than a group of competitive retailers, Superduper would 
be worse off if its retailers were a cartel.
Second, economists believe that resale price maintenance has a legitimate goal. 
Superduper may want its retailers to provide customers a pleasant showroom and 
a knowledgeable sales force. Yet, without resale price maintenance, some custom­
ers would take advantage of one store’s service to learn about the DVD player’s 
special features and then buy the item at a discount retailer that does not provide 
this service. To some extent, good service is a public good among the retailers 
that sell Superduper products. As we discussed in Chapter 11, when one person 
provides a public good, others are able to enjoy it without paying for it. In this 
case, discount retailers would free ride on the service provided by other retailers, 
leading to less service than is desirable. Resale price maintenance is one way for 
Superduper to solve this free-rider problem.
The example of resale price maintenance illustrates an important principle: 
Business practices that appear to reduce competition may in fact have legitimate purposes. 
This principle makes the application of the antitrust laws all the more difficult. The 
economists, lawyers, and judges in charge of enforcing these laws must ­determine 
what kinds of behavior public policy should prohibit as impeding competition and 
reducing economic well-being. Often that job is not easy.
Predatory Pricing  Firms with market power normally use that power to raise 
prices above the competitive level. But should policymakers ever be concerned 
that firms with market power might charge prices that are too low? This question 
is at the heart of a second debate over antitrust policy.
Imagine that a large airline, call it Coyote Air, has a monopoly on some route. 
Then Roadrunner Express enters and takes 20 percent of the market, leaving 
Coyote with 80 percent. In response to this competition, Coyote starts slashing its 
fares. Some antitrust analysts argue that Coyote’s move could be anticompetitive: 
The price cuts may be intended to drive Roadrunner out of the market so Coyote 
can recapture its monopoly and raise prices again. Such behavior is called preda-
tory pricing.
Although predatory pricing is a common claim in antitrust suits, some econo­
mists are skeptical of this argument and believe that predatory pricing is rarely, 
and perhaps never, a profitable business strategy. Why? For a price war to drive 
out a rival, prices have to be driven below cost. Yet if Coyote starts selling cheap 
tickets at a loss, it had better be ready to fly more planes, because low fares will 
attract more customers. Roadrunner, meanwhile, can respond to Coyote’s preda­
tory move by cutting back on flights. As a result, Coyote ends up bearing more 
than 80 percent of the losses, putting Roadrunner in a good position to survive the 
price war. As in the old Roadrunner-Coyote cartoons, the predator suffers more 
than the prey.

CHAPTER 17    Oligopoly
Economists continue to debate whether predatory pricing should be a concern 
for antitrust policymakers. Various questions remain unresolved. Is predatory 
pricing ever a profitable business strategy? If so, when? Are the courts capable of 
telling which price cuts are competitive and thus good for consumers and which 
are predatory? There are no simple answers.
Tying  A third example of a controversial business practice is tying. Suppose 
that Makemoney Movies produces two new films—Ironman and Hamlet. If 
Makemoney offers theaters the two films together at a single price, rather than 
separately, the studio is said to be tying its two products. 
When the practice of tying movies was challenged in the courts, the Supreme 
Court banned it. The court reasoned as follows: Imagine that Ironman is a block­
buster, whereas Hamlet is an unprofitable art film. Then the studio could use the 
high demand for Ironman to force theaters to buy Hamlet. It seemed that the studio 
could use tying as a mechanism for expanding its market power.
Many economists are skeptical of this argument. Imagine that theaters are 
willing to pay $20,000 for Ironman and nothing for Hamlet. Then the most that a 
theater would pay for the two movies together is $20,000—the same as it would 
pay for Ironman by itself. Forcing the theater to accept a worthless movie as part 
of the deal does not increase the theater’s willingness to pay. Makemoney cannot 
increase its market power simply by bundling the two movies together.
Why, then, does tying exist? One possibility is that it is a form of price discrimi­
nation. Suppose there are two theaters. City Theater is willing to pay $15,000 for 
Ironman and $5,000 for Hamlet. Country Theater is just the opposite: It is willing 
to pay $5,000 for Ironman and $15,000 for Hamlet. If Makemoney charges separate 
prices for the two films, its best strategy is to charge $15,000 for each film, and 
each theater chooses to show only one film. Yet if Makemoney offers the two mov­
ies as a bundle, it can charge each theater $20,000 for the movies. Thus, if different 
theaters value the films differently, tying may allow the studio to increase profit 
by charging a combined price closer to the buyers’ total willingness to pay.
Tying remains a controversial business practice. The Supreme Court’s argu­
ment that tying allows a firm to extend its market power to other goods is not 
well founded, at least in its simplest form. Yet economists have proposed more 
elaborate theories for how tying can impede competition. Given our current eco­
nomic knowledge, it is unclear whether tying has adverse effects for society as a 
whole. 
The Microsoft Case
The most important and controversial antitrust case in recent years has been the 
U.S. government’s suit against the Microsoft Corporation, filed in 1998. Certainly, 
the case did not lack drama. It pitted one of the world’s richest men (Bill Gates) 
against one of the world’s most powerful regulatory agencies (the U.S. Justice 
Department). Testifying for the government was a prominent economist (MIT 
professor Franklin Fisher). Testifying for Microsoft was an equally prominent 
economist (MIT professor Richard Schmalensee). At stake was the future of one of 
the world’s most valuable companies (Microsoft) in one of the economy’s fastest-
growing industries (computer software).

A central issue in the Microsoft case involved tying—in particular, whether 
Microsoft should be allowed to integrate its Internet browser into its Windows 
operating system. The government claimed that Microsoft was bundling these 
two products together to expand its market power in computer operating systems 
into the unrelated market of Internet browsers. Allowing Microsoft to incorporate 
such products into its operating system, the government argued, would deter 
other software companies from entering the market and offering new products.
	
Microsoft responded by pointing out that putting new features into old prod­
ucts is a natural part of technological progress. Cars today include CD players 
and air conditioners, which were once sold separately, and cameras come with 
built-in flashes. The same is true with operating systems. Over time, Microsoft 
has added many features to Windows that were previously stand-alone products. 
This has made computers more reliable and easier to use because consumers can 
be confident that the pieces work together. The integration of Internet technology, 
Microsoft argued, was the natural next step.
	
One point of disagreement concerned the extent of Microsoft’s market power. 
Noting that more than 80 percent of new personal computers use a Microsoft 
operating system, the government argued that the company had substantial 
monopoly power, which it was trying to expand. Microsoft replied that the soft­
ware market is always changing and that Microsoft’s Windows was constantly 
being challenged by competitors, such as the Apple Mac and Linux operating 
systems. It also argued that the low price it charged for Windows—about $50, or 
only 3 percent of the price of a typical computer—was evidence that its market 
power was severely limited.
	
Like many large antitrust suits, the Microsoft case became a legal morass. In 
November 1999, after a long trial, Judge Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft had 
great monopoly power and that it had illegally abused that power. In June 2000, 
after hearings on possible remedies, he ordered that Microsoft be broken up into 
two companies—one that sold the operating system and one that sold applica­
tions software. A year later, an appeals court overturned Jackson’s breakup order 
and handed the case to a new judge. In September 2001, the Justice Department 
announced that it no longer sought a breakup of the company and wanted to 
settle the case quickly. 
	
A settlement was finally reached in November 2002. Microsoft accepted some 
restrictions on its business practices, and the government accepted that a browser 
would remain part of the Windows operating system. But the settlement did not 
end Microsoft’s antitrust troubles. In recent years, the company has contended 
with several private antitrust suits, as well as suits brought by the European 
Union alleging a variety of anticompetitive behaviors.  ■

Conclusion
Oligopolies would like to act like monopolies, but self-interest drives them 
toward competition. Where oligopolies end up on this spectrum depends on the 
number of firms in the oligopoly and how cooperative the firms are. The story of

CHAPTER 17    Oligopoly
 The Next Big Antitrust Target?
Google is a widely used search engine—so widely used, in fact, that it 
has attracted the attention of government lawyers.
in the news
Google Says It’s 
Actually Quite Small
By Jeff Horwitz
T
hree times in the past month, govern-
ment agencies have targeted Google for 
antitrust reviews. An outstanding private 
lawsuit alleges that Google tried to kill 
a business-to-business search engine with 
predatory pricing. And during the wan-
ing months of the Bush administration, 
soon-to-be Obama antitrust chief Christine 
Varney declared that Google “has acquired 
a monopoly in Internet online advertising.” 
Last month she asserted that the Bush 
administration had been too lax in com-
bating monopolistic behavior and that the 
Obama Justice Department would no longer 
“stand on the sidelines.” 
	
That should explain why Dana Wagner, 
a former Department of Justice antitrust 
lawyer hired by Google just last year, is rap-
idly becoming one of the company’s public 
faces. Along with Adam Kovacevich, a 
company public-policy spokesman, Wagner 
has been talking to advertising clients, pub-
lic officials, reporters and academics in an 
effort to diffuse the impression that Google 
has a competition law problem. 
	
As might be expected, Google’s pre-
sentation highlights the company’s many 
good works and “don’t be evil” corporate 
philosophy. But there’s another element 
at front and center of the presentation: 
According to Warner and Kovacevich, their 
company holds only a 2.66 percent share of 
its total market. 
	
If that number seems low for the run-
away success story of the Internet age, 
Google wants you to believe that it’s just a 
question of market definition. Google rejects 
the idea that it’s in the search advertising 
business, an industry in which it holds more 
than a 70 percent share of revenue. Instead, 
the company says that its competition is 
all advertising, a category broad enough 
to include newspaper, radio and highway 
billboards. Google’s argument is not simply 
that it’s not a big bully. If you believe the 
company, it’s not even that big…. 
	
At first glance, this seems like a tough 
position to defend. There’s a sharp differ-
ence between how companies use mass-
market tools like billboards and how they 
use search-based advertising, which targets 
consumers far closer to the point of sale. 
And even if you buy Google’s claim that the 
lines between media have been blurred by 
technology, it’s still hard to explain how the 
company could maintain a 30 percent oper-
ating margin, despite money-losing outlays 
in a host of adjacent fields, if it faced seri-
ous competition. As Wagner himself notes, 
arguing that Google’s market is broader 
than search advertising is not intuitive. 
When Microsoft tried to argue that it didn’t 
have a monopoly in the 1990s, that strategy 
was widely seen as disingenuous. 
	
But that raises the question: “Why 
bother?” There’s no law against trouncing 
your business competitors. Ever since Judge 
Learned Hand’s landmark decision in U.S. 
v. Aluminum Co. of America 64 years ago, 
the court has recognized that under certain 
circumstances a company may come to 
dominate its field through “superior skill, 
foresight, and industry.” 
	
It’s hard to see Google as anything other 
than a model example of such a company. 
Moreover, nobody’s come up with a particu-
larly good case that the company has been 
stifling other companies…. 
	
Still, Google has reason to dread the 
perception of even benign dominance. Just 
ask Gary Reback, an attorney for Carr & 
Ferrell who played a big role in pinning 
monopoly status to Microsoft in the 1990s. 
Even if U.S. antitrust law allows for justly 
earned monopolies, it’s rare that a high-
profile company ever gets to enjoy that 
status in peace. 
	
As Reback puts it, the government’s 
approach has traditionally been: “We won’t 
punish you for being successful. But if you’re 
a monopolist and you spit on the sidewalk, 
we’ll break up your company.”

PART v	
Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
Key Concepts
the prisoners’ dilemma shows why oligopolies can fail to maintain cooperation, 
even when cooperation is in their best interest.
Policymakers regulate the behavior of oligopolists through the antitrust laws. 
The proper scope of these laws is the subject of ongoing controversy. Although 
price fixing among competing firms clearly reduces economic welfare and should 
be illegal, some business practices that appear to reduce competition may have 
legitimate if subtle purposes. As a result, policymakers need to be careful when 
they use the substantial powers of the antitrust laws to place limits on firm 
behavior.
Summary 
• Oligopolists maximize their total profits by 
forming a cartel and acting like a monopolist. 
Yet, if oligopolists make decisions about 
production levels individually, the result is a 
greater quantity and a lower price than under 
the monopoly outcome. The larger the number 
of firms in the oligopoly, the closer the quantity 
and price will be to the levels that would prevail 
under perfect competition.
• The prisoners’ dilemma shows that self-
interest can prevent people from maintaining 
cooperation, even when cooperation is in their 
mutual interest. The logic of the prisoners’ 
dilemma applies in many situations, including 
arms races, common-resource problems, and 
oligopolies.
• Policymakers use the antitrust laws to prevent 
oligopolies from engaging in behavior that 
reduces competition. The application of these 
laws can be controversial, because some behavior 
that can appear to reduce competition may in 
fact have legitimate business purposes.

CHAPTER 17    Oligopoly
Problems and Applications
	 1.	 A large share of the world supply of diamonds 
comes from Russia and South Africa. Suppose 
that the marginal cost of mining diamonds 
is constant at $1,000 per diamond, and the 
demand for diamonds is described by the 
following schedule:
	
Price	
Quantity
	
$8,000	
5,000 diamonds
	
7,000	
6,000
	
6,000	
7,000
	
5,000	
8,000
	
4,000	
9,000
	
3,000	
10,000
	
2,000	
11,000
	
1,000	
12,000
a.	 If there were many suppliers of diamonds, 
what would be the price and quantity?
b.	If there were only one supplier of diamonds, 
what would be the price and quantity?
c.	 If Russia and South Africa formed a cartel, 
what would be the price and quantity? If 
the countries split the market evenly, what 
would be South Africa’s production and 
profit? What would happen to South Africa’s 
profit if it increased its production by 1,000 
while Russia stuck to the cartel agreement?
d.	Use your answers to part (c) to explain why 
cartel agreements are often not successful.
	 2.	 The New York Times (Nov. 30, 1993) reported 
that “the inability of OPEC to agree last week 
to cut production has sent the oil market into 
turmoil . . . [leading to] the lowest price for 
domestic crude oil since June 1990.”
a.	 Why were the members of OPEC trying to 
agree to cut production?
b.	Why do you suppose OPEC was unable to 
agree on cutting production? Why did the oil 
market go into “turmoil” as a result?
c.	 The newspaper also noted OPEC’s view “that 
producing nations outside the organization, 
like Norway and Britain, should do their 
share and cut production.” What does 
the phrase “do their share” suggest about 
OPEC’s desired relationship with Norway 
and Britain?
	 3.	 This chapter discusses companies that are 
oligopolists in the market for the goods they 
sell. Many of the same ideas apply to companies 
that are oligopolists in the market for the inputs 
they buy.
a.	 If sellers who are oligopolists try to increase 
the price of goods they sell, what is the goal 
of buyers who are oligopolists?
b.	Major league baseball team owners have  
an oligopoly in the market for baseball 
players. What is the owners’ goal regarding 
players’ salaries? Why is this goal difficult  
to achieve?
c.	 Baseball players went on strike in 1994 
because they would not accept the salary 
cap that the owners wanted to impose. If the 
owners were already colluding over salaries, 
why did the owners feel the need for a salary 
cap?
	 4.	 Consider trade relations between the United 
States and Mexico. Assume that the leaders 
of the two countries believe the payoffs to 
alternative trade policies are as follows:
United States’ Decision
Low
Tariffs
Low Tariffs
U.S. gains
$25 billion
Mexico gains
$25 billion
Mexico gains
$10 billion
Mexico gains
$30 billion
Mexico gains
$20 billion
U.S. gains
$30 billion
U.S. gains
$10 billion
U.S. gains
$20 billion
High Tariffs
High
Tariffs
Mexico’s
Decision
a.	 What is the dominant strategy for the United 
States? For Mexico? Explain.
b.	Define Nash equilibrium. What is the Nash 
equilibrium for trade policy?
c.	 In 1993, the U.S. Congress ratified the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, in which 
the United States and Mexico agreed to 
reduce trade barriers simultaneously. Do the 
perceived payoffs shown here justify this 
approach to trade policy? Explain.
d.	Based on your understanding of the gains 
from trade (discussed in Chapters 3 and 9),  
do you think that these payoffs actually 
reflect a nation’s welfare under the four 
possible outcomes?

	 6.	 You and a classmate are assigned a project on 
which you will receive one combined grade. 
You each want to receive a good grade, but you 
also want to avoid hard work. In particular, 
here is the situation:
• If both of you work hard, you both get an A, 
which gives each of you 40 units of happiness.
• If only one of you works hard, you both 
get a B, which gives each of you 30 units of 
happiness.
• If neither of you works hard, you both get a D, 
which gives each of you 10 units of happiness.
• Working hard costs 25 units of happiness.

c.	 If you get this classmate as your partner  
on a series of projects throughout the year, 
rather than only once, how might that  
change the outcome you predicted in  
part (b)? 
d.	Another classmate cares more about good 
grades: He gets 50 units of happiness for 
a B, and 80 units of happiness for an A. If 
this classmate were your partner (but your 
preferences were unchanged), how would 
your answers to parts (a) and (b) change? 
Which of the two classmates would you 
prefer as a partner? Would he also want you 
as a partner?
	 7.	 A case study in the chapter describes a phone 
conversation between the presidents of 
American Airlines and Braniff Airways. Let’s 
analyze the game between the two companies. 
Suppose that each company can charge either 
a high price for tickets or a low price. If one 
company charges $100, it earns low profits if 
the other company charges $100 also and high 
profits if the other company charges $200. On 
the other hand, if the company charges $200, 
it earns very low profits if the other company 
charges $100 and medium profits if the other 
company charges $200 also. 
a.	 Draw the decision box for this game.
b.	What is the Nash equilibrium in this game? 
Explain.
c.	 Is there an outcome that would be better than 
the Nash equilibrium for both airlines? How 
could it be achieved? Who would lose if it 
were achieved?
	 8.	 Two athletes of equal ability are competing for 
a prize of $10,000. Each is deciding whether to 
take a dangerous performance-enhancing drug. 
If one athlete takes the drug, and the other 
does not, the one who takes the drug wins the 
prize. If both or neither take the drug, they tie 
and split the prize. Taking the drug imposes 
health risks that are equivalent to a loss of  
X dollars.
a.	 Draw a 2×2 payoff matrix describing the 
decisions the athletes face.
b.	For what X is taking the drug the Nash 
equilibrium?
c.	 Does making the drug safer (that is, lowering 
X) make the athletes better or worse off? 
Explain.

so you had better stay out.” Do you think  
Little Kona should believe the threat?  
Why or why not? 
d.	If the two firms could collude and agree on

	10.	 Let’s return to the chapter’s discussion of Jack 
and Jill’s water duopoly. Suppose that Jack  
and Jill are at the duopoly’s Nash equilibrium 
(80 gallons) when a third person, John, 
discovers a water source and joins the market  
as a third producer.
a.	 Jack and Jill propose that the three of them 
continue to produce a total of 80 gallons, 
splitting the market three ways. If John 
agrees to this, how much profit will he make?
b.	After agreeing to the proposed deal, John is 
considering increasing his production by  
10 gallons. If he does, and Jack and Jill stick 
to the agreement, how much profit will John 
make? What does this tell you about the 
proposed agreement?
c.	 What is the Nash equilibrium for this market 
with three producers? How does it compare 
to the Nash equilibrium with two producers?
