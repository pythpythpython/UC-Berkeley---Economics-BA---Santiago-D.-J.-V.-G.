Brazil. Over breakfast, you watch a news program broadcast from New 
York on your television made in China. You get dressed in clothes made 
of cotton grown in Georgia and sewn in factories in Thailand. You drive to class

in Massachusetts, published by a company located in Ohio, and printed on paper

Every day, you rely on many people, most of whom you have never met, to 
provide you with the goods and services that you enjoy. Such interdependence 
is possible because people trade with one another. Those people providing you

Introduction
other consumers with the goods and services they produce because they get 
something in return. 
In subsequent chapters, we examine how our economy coordinates the activi-
ties of millions of people with varying tastes and abilities. As a starting point for 
this analysis, here we consider the reasons for economic interdependence. One 
of the Ten Principles of Economics highlighted in Chapter 1 is that trade can make 
everyone better off. In this chapter, we examine this principle more closely. What 
exactly do people gain when they trade with one another? Why do people choose 
to become interdependent?
The answers to these questions are key to understanding the modern global 
economy. In most countries today, many goods and services consumed are 
imported from abroad, and many goods and services produced are exported to 
foreign customers. The analysis in this chapter explains interdependence not only 
among individuals but also among nations. As we will see, the gains from trade 
are much the same whether you are buying a haircut from your local barber or a 
T-shirt made by a worker on the other side of the globe.
A Parable for the Modern Economy
To understand why people choose to depend on others for goods and services and 
how this choice improves their lives, let’s look at a simple economy. Imagine that 
there are two goods in the world: meat and potatoes. And there are two people 
in the world—a cattle rancher and a potato farmer—each of whom would like to 
eat both meat and potatoes.
The gains from trade are most obvious if the rancher can produce only meat 
and the farmer can produce only potatoes. In one scenario, the rancher and the 
farmer could choose to have nothing to do with each other. But after several 
months of eating beef roasted, boiled, broiled, and grilled, the rancher might 
decide that self-sufficiency is not all it’s cracked up to be. The farmer, who has 
been eating potatoes mashed, fried, baked, and scalloped, would likely agree. It is 
easy to see that trade would allow them to enjoy greater variety: Each could then 
have a steak with a baked potato or a burger with fries.
Although this scene illustrates most simply how everyone can benefit from 
trade, the gains would be similar if the rancher and the farmer were each capable 
of producing the other good, but only at great cost. Suppose, for example, that the 
potato farmer is able to raise cattle and produce meat, but that he is not very good 
at it. Similarly, suppose that the cattle rancher is able to grow potatoes but that her 
land is not very well suited for it. In this case, the farmer and the rancher can each 
benefit by specializing in what he or she does best and then trading with the other.
The gains from trade are less obvious, however, when one person is better at 
producing every good. For example, suppose that the rancher is better at raising 
cattle and better at growing potatoes than the farmer. In this case, should the 
rancher choose to remain self-sufficient? Or is there still reason for her to trade 
with the farmer? To answer this question, we need to look more closely at the fac-
tors that affect such a decision.
Production Possibilities
Suppose that the farmer and the rancher each work 8  hours per day and can 
devote this time to growing potatoes, raising cattle, or a combination of the two.

CHAPTER 3    Interdependence and the Gains from Trade
The table in Figure 1 shows the amount of time each person requires to produce 
1 ounce of each good. The farmer can produce an ounce of potatoes in 15 minutes 
and an ounce of meat in 60 minutes. The rancher, who is more productive in both 
activities, can produce an ounce of potatoes in 10 minutes and an ounce of meat 
in 20 minutes. The last two columns in the table show the amounts of meat or 
potatoes the farmer and rancher can produce if they work an 8-hour day produc-
ing only that good.
Panel (b) of Figure 1 illustrates the amounts of meat and potatoes that the 
farmer can produce. If the farmer devotes all 8 hours of his time to potatoes, he 
produces 32 ounces of potatoes (measured on the horizontal axis) and no meat. If 
he devotes all his time to meat, he produces 8 ounces of meat (measured on the 
vertical axis) and no potatoes. If the farmer divides his time equally between the 
two activities, spending 4 hours on each, he produces 16 ounces of potatoes and 
4 ounces of meat. The figure shows these three possible outcomes and all others 
in between.

Introduction
This graph is the farmer’s production possibilities frontier. As we discussed in 
Chapter 2, a production possibilities frontier shows the various mixes of output 
that an economy can produce. It illustrates one of the Ten Principles of Economics 
in Chapter 1: People face trade-offs. Here the farmer faces a trade-off between 
producing meat and producing potatoes. 
You may recall that the production possibilities frontier in Chapter 2 was 
drawn bowed out. In that case, the rate at which society could trade one good for 
the other depended on the amounts that were being produced. Here, however, the 
farmer’s technology for producing meat and potatoes (as summarized in Figure 1) 
allows him to switch between the two goods at a constant rate. Whenever the 
farmer spends 1 hour less producing meat and 1 hour more producing potatoes, 
he reduces his output of meat by 1 ounce and raises his output of potatoes by 
4 ounces—and this is true regardless of how much he is already producing. As a 
result, the production possibilities frontier is a straight line.
Panel (c) of Figure 1 shows the production possibilities frontier for the rancher. 
If the rancher devotes all 8 hours of her time to potatoes, she produces 48 ounces of 
potatoes and no meat. If she devotes all her time to meat, she produces 24 ounces 
of meat and no potatoes. If the rancher divides her time equally, spending 4 hours 
on each activity, she produces 24 ounces of potatoes and 12 ounces of meat. Once 
again, the production possibilities frontier shows all the possible outcomes.
If the farmer and rancher choose to be self-sufficient rather than trade with 
each other, then each consumes exactly what he or she produces. In this case, the 
production possibilities frontier is also the consumption possibilities frontier. That 
is, without trade, Figure 1 shows the possible combinations of meat and potatoes 
that the farmer and rancher can each produce and then consume.
These production possibilities frontiers are useful in showing the trade-offs 
that the farmer and rancher face, but they do not tell us what the farmer and 
rancher will actually choose to do. To determine their choices, we need to know 
the tastes of the farmer and the rancher. Let’s suppose they choose the combina-
tions identified by points A and B in Figure 1: The farmer produces and consumes 
16 ounces of potatoes and 4 ounces of meat, while the rancher produces and con-
sumes 24 ounces of potatoes and 12 ounces of meat. 
Specialization and Trade
After several years of eating combination B, the rancher gets an idea and goes to 
talk to the farmer:
	Rancher:	 Farmer, my friend, have I got a deal for you! I know how to improve 
life for both of us. I think you should stop producing meat alto-
gether and devote all your time to growing potatoes. According to 
my calculations, if you work 8 hours a day growing potatoes, you’ll 
produce 32 ounces of potatoes. If you give me 15 of those 32 ounces, 
I’ll give you 5 ounces of meat in return. In the end, you’ll get to eat 
17 ounces of potatoes and 5 ounces of meat every day, instead of the 
16 ounces of potatoes and 4 ounces of meat you now get. If you go 
along with my plan, you’ll have more of both foods. [To illustrate her 
point, the rancher shows the farmer panel (a) of Figure 2.]
	 Farmer:	 (sounding skeptical) That seems like a good deal for me. But I don’t 
understand why you are offering it. If the deal is so good for me, it 
can’t be good for you too.
	Rancher:	 Oh, but it is! Suppose I spend 6 hours a day raising cattle and 
2 hours growing potatoes. Then I can produce 18 ounces of meat

and 12 ounces of potatoes. After I give you 5 ounces of my meat in 
exchange for 15 ounces of your potatoes, I’ll end up with 13 ounces of 
meat and 27 ounces of potatoes, instead of the 12 ounces of meat and 
24 ounces of potatoes that I now get. So I will also consume more of 
both foods than I do now. [She points out panel (b) of Figure 2.] 
	 Farmer:	 I don’t know. . . . This sounds too good to be true.
	Rancher:	 It’s really not as complicated as it first seems. Here—I’ve summa-
rized my proposal for you in a simple table. [The rancher shows the 
farmer a copy of the table at the bottom of Figure 2.]
	 Farmer:	 (after pausing to study the table) These calculations seem correct, but 
I am puzzled. How can this deal make us both better off?

Introduction
	Rancher:	 We can both benefit because trade allows each of us to specialize in 
doing what we do best. You will spend more time growing potatoes 
and less time raising cattle. I will spend more time raising cattle and 
less time growing potatoes. As a result of specialization and trade, 
each of us can consume more meat and more potatoes without work-
ing any more hours. 
Quick Quiz  Draw an example of a production possibilities frontier for Robinson 
Crusoe, a shipwrecked sailor who spends his time gathering coconuts and catching 
fish. Does this frontier limit Crusoe’s consumption of coconuts and fish if he lives by 
himself? Does he face the same limits if he can trade with natives on the island?
Comparative Advantage: The Driving Force of Specialization
The rancher’s explanation of the gains from trade, though correct, poses a puzzle: 
If the rancher is better at both raising cattle and growing potatoes, how can the 
farmer ever specialize in doing what he does best? The farmer doesn’t seem to do 
anything best. To solve this puzzle, we need to look at the principle of comparative 
advantage.
As a first step in developing this principle, consider the following question: 
In our example, who can produce potatoes at a lower cost—the farmer or the 
rancher? There are two possible answers, and in these two answers lie the solution 
to our puzzle and the key to understanding the gains from trade.
Absolute Advantage
One way to answer the question about the cost of producing potatoes is to com-
pare the inputs required by the two producers. Economists use the term absolute 
advantage when comparing the productivity of one person, firm, or nation to that 
of another. The producer that requires a smaller quantity of inputs to produce a 
good is said to have an absolute advantage in producing that good. 
In our example, time is the only input, so we can determine absolute advan-
tage by looking at how much time each type of production takes. The rancher 
has an absolute advantage both in producing meat and in producing potatoes 
because she requires less time than the farmer to produce a unit of either good. 
The rancher needs to input only 20 minutes to produce an ounce of meat, whereas 
the farmer needs 60 minutes. Similarly, the rancher needs only 10 minutes to pro-
duce an ounce of potatoes, whereas the farmer needs 15 minutes. Based on this 
information, we can conclude that the rancher has the lower cost of producing 
potatoes, if we measure cost by the quantity of inputs.
Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage
There is another way to look at the cost of producing potatoes. Rather than 
comparing inputs required, we can compare the opportunity costs. Recall from 
Chapter 1 that the opportunity cost of some item is what we give up to get that 
item. In our example, we assumed that the farmer and the rancher each spend 
8  hours a day working. Time spent producing potatoes, therefore, takes away 
from time available for producing meat. When reallocating time between the two 
goods, the rancher and farmer give up units of one good to produce units of the 
other, thereby moving along the production possibilities frontier. The opportunity 
cost measures the trade-off between the two goods that each producer faces.

CHAPTER 3    Interdependence and the Gains from Trade
Let’s first consider the rancher’s opportunity cost. According to the table in 
panel (a) of Figure 1, producing 1 ounce of potatoes takes 10 minutes of work. 
When the rancher spends those 10 minutes producing potatoes, she spends 
10 minutes less producing meat. Because the rancher needs 20 minutes to produce 
1 ounce of meat, 10 minutes of work would yield ½ ounce of meat. Hence, the 
rancher’s opportunity cost of producing 1 ounce of potatoes is ½ ounce of meat.
Now consider the farmer’s opportunity cost. Producing 1 ounce of potatoes 
takes him 15 minutes. Because he needs 60 minutes to produce 1 ounce of meat, 
15 minutes of work would yield ¼ ounce of meat. Hence, the farmer’s opportunity 
cost of 1 ounce of potatoes is ¼ ounce of meat.
Table 1 shows the opportunity costs of meat and potatoes for the two producers. 
Notice that the opportunity cost of meat is the inverse of the opportunity cost of pota-
toes. Because 1 ounce of potatoes costs the rancher ½ ounce of meat, 1 ounce of meat 
costs the rancher 2 ounces of potatoes. Similarly, because 1 ounce of potatoes costs 
the farmer ¼ ounce of meat, 1 ounce of meat costs the farmer 4 ounces of potatoes.
Economists use the term comparative advantage when describing the oppor-
tunity cost of two producers. The producer who gives up less of other goods to 
produce Good X has the smaller opportunity cost of producing Good X and is 
said to have a comparative advantage in producing it. In our example, the farmer 
has a lower opportunity cost of producing potatoes than the rancher: An ounce of 
potatoes costs the farmer only ¼ ounce of meat, but it costs the rancher ½ ounce of 
meat. Conversely, the rancher has a lower opportunity cost of producing meat than 
the farmer: An ounce of meat costs the rancher 2 ounces of potatoes, but it costs 
the farmer 4 ounces of potatoes. Thus, the farmer has a comparative advantage in 
growing potatoes, and the rancher has a comparative advantage in producing meat.
Although it is possible for one person to have an absolute advantage in both 
goods (as the rancher does in our example), it is impossible for one person to 
have a comparative advantage in both goods. Because the opportunity cost of one 
good is the inverse of the opportunity cost of the other, if a person’s opportunity 
cost of one good is relatively high, the opportunity cost of the other good must 
be relatively low. Comparative advantage reflects the relative opportunity cost. 
Unless two people have exactly the same opportunity cost, one person will have a 
comparative advantage in one good, and the other person will have a comparative 
advantage in the other good. 
Comparative Advantage and Trade
The gains from specialization and trade are based not on absolute advantage but on 
comparative advantage. When each person specializes in producing the good for 
which he or she has a comparative advantage, total production in the economy rises. 
This increase in the size of the economic pie can be used to make everyone better off.

Introduction
In our example, the farmer spends more time growing potatoes, and the rancher 
spends more time producing meat. As a result, the total production of potatoes 
rises from 40 to 44  ounces, and the total production of meat rises from 16 to 
18 ounces. The farmer and rancher share the benefits of this increased production. 
We can also look at the gains from trade in terms of the price that each party 
pays the other. Because the farmer and rancher have different opportunity costs, 
they can both get a bargain. That is, each benefits from trade by obtaining a good 
at a price that is lower than his or her opportunity cost of that good. 
Consider the proposed deal from the viewpoint of the farmer. The farmer gets 
5 ounces of meat in exchange for 15 ounces of potatoes. In other words, the farmer 
buys each ounce of meat for a price of 3 ounces of potatoes. This price of meat is 
lower than his opportunity cost for an ounce of meat, which is 4 ounces of potatoes. 
Thus, the farmer benefits from the deal because he gets to buy meat at a good price. 
Now consider the deal from the rancher’s viewpoint. The rancher buys 
15 ounces of potatoes for a price of 5 ounces of meat. That is, the price of potatoes 
is ¹∕³ ounce of meat. This price of potatoes is lower than her opportunity cost of 
an ounce of potatoes, which is ½ ounce of meat. The rancher benefits because she 
gets to buy potatoes at a good price.
The moral of the story of the farmer and the rancher should now be clear: Trade 
can benefit everyone in society because it allows people to specialize in activities in which 
they have a comparative advantage. 
The Price of the Trade
The principle of comparative advantage establishes that there are gains from spe-
cialization and trade, but it leaves open a couple of related questions: What deter-
mines the price at which trade takes place? How are the gains from trade shared 
between the trading parties? The precise answer to these questions is beyond the 
scope of this chapter, but we can state one general rule: For both parties to gain from 
trade, the price at which they trade must lie between the two opportunity costs.
In our example, the farmer and rancher agreed to trade at a rate of 3 ounces of 
potatoes for each ounce of meat. This price is between the rancher’s opportunity 
cost (2 ounces of potatoes per ounce of meat) and the farmer’s opportunity cost 
(4 ounces of potatoes per ounce of meat). The price need not be exactly in the 
middle for both parties to gain, but it must be somewhere between 2 and 4.
To see why the price has to be in this range, consider what would happen if it 
were not. If the price of meat were below 2 ounces of potatoes, both the farmer 
and the rancher would want to buy meat, because the price would be below their 
opportunity costs. Similarly, if the price of meat were above 4 ounces of potatoes, 
both would want to sell meat, because the price would be above their opportunity 
costs. But there are only two members of this economy. They cannot both be buyers 
of meat, nor can they both be sellers. Someone has to take the other side of the deal.
A mutually advantageous trade can be struck at a price between 2 and 4. In this 
price range, the rancher wants to sell meat to buy potatoes, and the farmer wants 
to sell potatoes to buy meat. Each party can buy a good at a price that is lower 
than his or her opportunity cost. In the end, both of them specialize in the good 
for which he or she has a comparative advantage and are, as a result, better off.

catching fish? Who has a comparative advantage in catching fish?

CHAPTER 3    Interdependence and the Gains from Trade
Applications of Comparative Advantage
The principle of comparative advantage explains interdependence and the gains 
from trade. Because interdependence is so prevalent in the modern world, the 
principle of comparative advantage has many applications. Here are two exam-
ples, one fanciful and one of great practical importance.
Should Tom Brady Mow His Own Lawn?
Tom Brady spends a lot of time running around on grass. One of the most talented 
football players of all time, he can throw a pass with a speed and accuracy that 
most casual athletes can only dream of. Most likely, he is talented at other physical 
activities as well. For example, let’s imagine that Brady can mow his lawn faster than 
anyone else. But just because he can mow his lawn fast, does this mean he should?
To answer this question, we can use the concepts of opportunity cost and com-
parative advantage. Let’s say that Brady can mow his lawn in 2 hours. In that 
FYI
 The Legacy of Adam Smith 
and David Ricardo
E
conomists have long understood the gains from trade. Here is 
how the great economist Adam Smith put the argument: 
It is a maxim of every prudent master of a family, never 
to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more 
to make than to buy. The tailor does not attempt to make 
his own shoes, but buys them of the shoemaker. The 
shoe­maker does not attempt to make his own clothes but 
employs a tailor. The farmer attempts to make neither the 
one nor the other, but employs those different artificers. 
All of them find it for their interest to employ their whole 
industry in a way in which they have some 
advantage over their neighbors, and to purchase 
with a part of its produce, or what is the same 
thing, with the price of part of it, whatever else 
they have occasion for.
This quotation is from Smith’s 1776 book An Inquiry 
into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 
which was a landmark in the analysis of trade and 
economic interdependence.
	
Smith’s book inspired David Ricardo, a millionaire 
stockbroker, to become an economist. In his 1817 
book Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, Ricardo devel-
oped the principle of comparative advantage as we know it today. 
He considered an example with two goods (wine and cloth) and two 
countries (England and Portugal). He showed that both countries 
can gain by opening up trade and specializing based on comparative 
advantage.
	
Ricardo’s theory is the starting point of modern international 
economics, but his defense of free trade was not a mere academic 
exercise. Ricardo put his beliefs to work as a member of the British 
Parliament, where he opposed the Corn Laws, which restricted the 
import of grain.
	
The conclusions of Adam Smith and David 
Ricardo on the gains from trade have held up well 
over time. Although economists often disagree on 
questions of policy, they are united in their support 
of free trade. Moreover, the central argument for 
free trade has not changed much in the past two 
centuries. Even though the field of economics has 
broadened its scope and refined its theories since the 
time of Smith and Ricardo, economists’ opposition to 
trade restrictions is still based largely on the principle 
of comparative advantage.

same 2 hours, he could film a television commercial and earn $20,000. By contrast, 
Forrest Gump, the boy next door, can mow Brady’s lawn in 4 hours. In that same 
4 hours, Gump could work at McDonald’s and earn $40. 
In this example, Brady has an absolute advantage in mowing lawns because he 
can do the work with a lower input of time. Yet because Brady’s opportunity cost 
of mowing the lawn is $20,000 and Gump’s opportunity cost is only $40, Gump 
has a comparative advantage in mowing lawns.
The gains from trade in this example are tremendous. Rather than mowing his 
own lawn, Brady should make the commercial and hire Gump to mow the lawn. 
As long as Brady pays Gump more than $40 and less than $20,000, both of them 
are better off.
Should the United States Trade  
with Other Countries?
Just as individuals can benefit from specialization and trade with one another, as 
the farmer and rancher did, so can populations of people in different countries. 
Many of the goods that Americans enjoy are produced abroad, and many of the 
goods produced in the United States are sold abroad. Goods produced abroad 
and sold domestically are called imports. Goods produced domestically and sold 
abroad are called exports.
To see how countries can benefit from trade, suppose there are two countries, 
the United States and Japan, and two goods, food and cars. Imagine that the two 
countries produce cars equally well: An American worker and a Japanese worker 
can each produce one car per month. By contrast, because the United States has 
more and better land, it is better at producing food: A U.S. worker can produce 
2 tons of food per month, whereas a Japanese worker can produce only 1 ton of 
food per month. 
The principle of comparative advantage states that each good should be 
produced by the country that has the smaller opportunity cost of producing 
that good. Because the opportunity cost of a car is 2 tons of food in the United 
States but only 1 ton of food in Japan, Japan has a comparative advantage in 
producing cars. Japan should produce more cars than it wants for its own use 
and export some of them to the United States. Similarly, because the opportu-
nity cost of a ton of food is 1 car in Japan but only ½ car in the United States, 
the United States has a comparative advantage in producing food. The United 
States should produce more food than it wants to consume and export some 
to Japan. Through specialization and trade, both countries can have more food 
and more cars.
In reality, of course, the issues involved in trade among nations are more com-
plex than this example suggests. Most important among these issues is that each 
country has many citizens with different interests. International trade can make 
some individuals worse off, even as it makes the country as a whole better off. 
When the United States exports food and imports cars, the impact on an American 
farmer is not the same as the impact on an American autoworker. Yet, contrary to 
the opinions sometimes voiced by politicians and pundits, international trade is 
not like war, in which some countries win and others lose. Trade allows all coun-
tries to achieve greater prosperity.

 The Changing Face of International Trade
A decade ago, no one would have asked which nation has a comparative 
advantage in slaying ogres. But technology is rapidly changing the goods 
and services that are traded across national borders.

Ogre to Slay? 
Outsource It to 
Chinese
By David Barboza
F
uzhou, China—One of China’s newest 
factories operates here in the basement 
of an old warehouse. Posters of World 
of Warcraft and Magic Land hang above 
a corps of young people glued to their 
computer screens, pounding away at their 
keyboards in the latest hustle for money.
	
The people working at this clandestine 
locale are “gold farmers.” Every day, in 
12-hour shifts, they “play” computer games 
by killing onscreen monsters and winning 
battles, harvesting artificial gold coins and 
other virtual goods as rewards that, as it 
turns out, can be transformed into real cash.
	
That is because, from Seoul to San 
Francisco, affluent online gamers who lack 
the time and patience to work their way up 
to the higher levels of gamedom are willing 
to pay the young Chinese here to play the 
early rounds for them. 
	
“For 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, my 
colleagues and I are killing monsters,” said 
a 23-year-old gamer who works here in this 
makeshift factory and goes by the online 
code name Wandering. “I make about $250 
a month, which is pretty good compared 
with the other jobs I’ve had. And I can play 
games all day.”
	
He and his comrades have created 
yet another new business out of cheap 
Chinese labor. They are tapping into the 
fast-growing world of “massively multi-
player online games,” which involve role 
playing and often revolve around fantasy 
or warfare in medieval kingdoms or distant 
galaxies. . . . 
	
For the Chinese in game-playing facto-
ries like these, though, it is not all fun and 
games. These workers have strict quotas 
and are supervised by bosses who equip 
them with computers, software and Internet 
connections to thrash online trolls, gnomes 
and ogres.
	
As they grind through the games, they 
accumulate virtual currency that is valu-
able to game players around the world. 
The games allow players to trade cur-
rency to other players, who can then use 
it to buy better armor, amulets, magic 
spells and other accoutrements to climb 
to higher levels or create more powerful 
characters. 
	
The Internet is now filled with classified 
advertisements from small companies—
many of them here in China—auctioning 
for real money their powerful figures, called 
avatars. . . . 
	
“It’s unimaginable how big this is,” 
says Chen Yu, 27, who employs 20 full-time 
gamers here in Fuzhou. “They say that in 
some of these popular games, 40 or 50 
percent of the players are actually Chinese 
farmers.”

PART I	
Introduction
to mow the lawn, the same economic forces are at work. The principle of compara-
tive advantage shows that trade can make everyone better off.
Having seen why interdependence is desirable, you might naturally ask how it 
is possible. How do free societies coordinate the diverse activities of all the people 
involved in their economies? What ensures that goods and services will get from 
those who should be producing them to those who should be consuming them? In 
a world with only two people, such as the rancher and the farmer, the answer is 
simple: These two people can bargain and allocate resources between themselves. 
In the real world with billions of people, the answer is less obvious. We take up 
this issue in the next chapter, where we see that free societies allocate resources 
through the market forces of supply and demand.

• Each person consumes goods and services pro-
duced by many other people both in the United 
States and around the world. Interdependence 
and trade are desirable because they allow 
everyone to enjoy a greater quantity and variety 
of goods and services.
• There are two ways to compare the ability of two 
people in producing a good. The person who 
can produce the good with the smaller quantity 
of inputs is said to have an absolute advantage in 
producing the good. The person who has the 
smaller opportunity cost of producing the good 
is said to have a comparative advantage. The gains 
from trade are based on comparative advantage, 
not absolute advantage.
• Trade makes everyone better off because it 
allows people to specialize in those activities in 
which they have a comparative advantage. 
• The principle of comparative advantage applies 
to countries as well as to people. Economists 
use the principle of comparative advantage to 
advocate free trade among countries.

tier for reading economics and sociology.
b.	What is Maria’s opportunity cost of reading 
100 pages of sociology?
	 2.	 American and Japanese workers can each pro-
duce 4 cars a year. An American worker can 
produce 10 tons of grain a year, whereas a 
Japanese worker can produce 5 tons of grain a 
year. To keep things simple, assume that each 
country has 100 million workers.
a.	 For this situation, construct a table analogous 
to the table in Figure 1. 
b.	Graph the production possibilities frontier of 
the American and Japanese economies.

cost of a car? Of grain? For Japan, what is the 
opportunity cost of a car? Of grain? Put this 
information in a table analogous to Table 1.
d.	Which country has an absolute advantage in 
producing cars? In producing grain?
e.	 Which country has a comparative advantage 
in producing cars? In producing grain?
f.	 Without trade, half of each country’s workers 
produce cars and half produce grain. What 
quantities of cars and grain does each coun-
try produce?
g.	Starting from a position without trade, give 
an example in which trade makes each coun-
try better off.
	 3.	 Pat and Kris are roommates. They spend most 
of their time studying (of course), but they leave 
some time for their favorite activities: making 
pizza and brewing root beer. Pat takes 4 hours 
to brew a gallon of root beer and 2 hours to 
make a pizza. Kris takes 6 hours to brew a gal-
lon of root beer and 4 hours to make a pizza.
a.	 What is each roommate’s opportunity cost 
of making a pizza? Who has the absolute 
advantage in making pizza? Who has the 
comparative advantage in making pizza?
b.	If Pat and Kris trade foods with each other, 
who will trade away pizza in exchange for 
root beer?
c.	 The price of pizza can be expressed in terms 
of gallons of root beer. What is the high-
est price at which pizza can be traded that 
would make both roommates better off? 
What is the lowest price? Explain.

Canada and that each of these workers can pro-
duce either 2 cars or 30 bushels of wheat in a year.
a.	 What is the opportunity cost of producing a 
car in Canada? What is the opportunity cost 
of producing a bushel of wheat in Canada? 
Explain the relationship between the oppor-
tunity costs of the two goods.
b.	Draw Canada’s production possibilities fron-
tier. If Canada chooses to consume 10 million 
cars, how much wheat can it consume with-
out trade? Label this point on the production 
possibilities frontier.
c.	 Now suppose that the United States offers to 
buy 10 million cars from Canada in exchange 
for 20 bushels of wheat per car. If Canada 
continues to consume 10 million cars, how 
much wheat does this deal allow Canada to 
consume? Label this point on your diagram. 
Should Canada accept the deal?
	 5.	 England and Scotland both produce scones and 
sweaters. Suppose that an English worker can 
produce 50 scones per hour or 1 sweater per 
hour. Suppose that a Scottish worker can pro-
duce 40 scones per hour or 2 sweaters per hour.
a.	 Which country has the absolute advantage in 
the production of each good? Which country 
has the comparative advantage?
b.	If England and Scotland decide to trade, 
which commodity will Scotland trade to 
England? Explain.
c.	 If a Scottish worker could produce only 1 
sweater per hour, would Scotland still gain 
from trade? Would England still gain from 
trade? Explain.
	 6.	 The following table describes the production pos-
sibilities of two cities in the country of Baseballia:

Introduction
a comparative advantage in the production of 
each color sock? 
c.	 If the cities trade with each other, which color 
sock will each export?
d.	What is the range of prices at which trade can 
occur?
	 7.	 Suppose that in a year an American worker  
can produce 100 shirts or 20 computers, while  
a Chinese worker can produce 100 shirts or  
10 computers.
a.	 Graph the production possibilities curve for 
the two countries. Suppose that without trade 
the workers in each country spend half their 
time producing each good. Identify this point 
in your graph.
b.	If these countries were open to trade, which 
country would export shirts? Give a specific 
numerical example and show it on your 
graph. Which country would benefit from 
trade? Explain.
c.	 Explain at what price of computers (in terms 
of shirts) the two countries might trade.
d.	Suppose that China catches up with 
American productivity so that a Chinese 
worker can produce 100 shirts or 20 com-
puters. What pattern of trade would you 
predict now? How does this advance  
in Chinese productivity affect the eco-
nomic well-being of the citizens of the two 
countries?
	 8.	 An average worker in Brazil can produce an 
ounce of soybeans in 20 minutes and an ounce  
of coffee in 60 minutes, while an average worker 
in Peru can produce an ounce of soybeans in  
50 minutes and an ounce of coffee in 75 minutes.
a.	 Who has the absolute advantage in coffee? 
Explain.
b.	Who has the comparative advantage in cof-
fee? Explain.
c.	 If the two countries specialize and trade  
with each other, who will import coffee? 
Explain.
d.	Assume that the two countries trade and that 
the country importing coffee trades 2 ounces 
of soybeans for 1 ounce of coffee. Explain why 
both countries will benefit from this trade.
	 9.	 Are the following statements true or false? 
Explain in each case.
a.	 “Two countries can achieve gains from trade 
even if one of the countries has an absolute 
advantage in the production of all goods.”
b.	 “Certain very talented people have a compara-
tive advantage in everything they do.”
c.	 “If a certain trade is good for one person, it 
can’t be good for the other one.”
d.	“If a certain trade is good for one person, it is 
always good for the other one.”
e.	 “If trade is good for a country, it must be 
good for everyone in the country.”
	10.	 The United States exports corn and aircraft to the 
rest of the world, and it imports oil and clothing 
from the rest of the world. Do you think this pat-
tern of trade is consistent with the principle of 
comparative advantage? Why or why not?
	11.	 Bill and Hillary produce food and clothing. In 
an hour, Bill can produce 1 unit of food or 1 unit 
of clothing, while Hillary can produce 2 units 
of food or 3 units of clothing. They each work 
10 hours a day.
a.	 Who has an absolute advantage in producing 
food? Who has an absolute advantage in pro-
ducing clothing? Explain.
b.	Who has a comparative advantage in produc-
ing food? Who has a comparative advantage 
in producing clothing? Explain.
c.	 Draw the production possibilities frontier 
for the household (that is, Bill and Hillary 
together) assuming that each spends the 
same number of hours each day as the other 
producing food and clothing.
d.	Hillary suggests, instead, that she specialize 
in making clothing. That is, she will do all the 
clothing production for the family; however, if 
all her time is devoted to clothing and they still 
want more, then Bill can help with clothing 
production. What does the household produc-
tion possibilities frontier look like now?
e.	 Bill suggests that Hillary specialize in produc-
ing food. That is, Hillary will do all the food 
production for the family; however, if all her 
time is devoted to food and they still want 
more, then Bill can help with food production. 
What does the household production possi-
bilities frontier look like under Bill’s proposal?
f.	 Comparing your answers to parts c, d, and e,  
which allocation of time makes the most 
sense? Relate your answer to the theory of 
comparative advantage.
