E
very field of study has its own language and its own way of thinking. 
Mathematicians talk about axioms, integrals, and vector spaces. Psycholo-
gists talk about ego, id, and cognitive dissonance. Lawyers talk about 
venue, torts, and promissory estoppel.
Economics is no different. Supply, demand, elasticity, comparative advantage, 
consumer surplus, deadweight loss—these terms are part of the economist’s lan-
guage. In the coming chapters, you will encounter many new terms and some 
familiar words that economists use in specialized ways. At first, this new lan-
guage may seem needlessly arcane. But as you will see, its value lies in its ability 
to provide you with a new and useful way of thinking about the world in which 
you live.
The purpose of this book is to help you learn the economist’s way of thinking. 
Just as you cannot become a mathematician, psychologist, or lawyer overnight, 
learning to think like an economist will take some time. Yet with a combination of

Introduction
theory, case studies, and examples of economics in the news, this book will give 
you ample opportunity to develop and practice this skill.
Before delving into the substance and details of economics, it is helpful to have 
an overview of how economists approach the world. This chapter discusses the 
field’s methodology. What is distinctive about how economists confront a ques-
tion? What does it mean to think like an economist?
The Economist as Scientist
Economists try to address their subject with a scientist’s objectivity. They 
approach the study of the economy in much the same way a physicist 
approaches the study of matter and a biologist approaches the study of life: 
They devise theories, collect data, and then analyze these data in an attempt to 
verify or refute their theories.
To beginners, it can seem odd to claim that economics is a science. After all, 
economists do not work with test tubes or telescopes. The essence of science, 
however, is the scientific method—the dispassionate development and testing of 
theories about how the world works. This method of inquiry is as applicable to 
studying a nation’s economy as it is to studying the earth’s gravity or a species’ 
evolution. As Albert Einstein once put it, “The whole of science is nothing more 
than the refinement of everyday thinking.”
Although Einstein’s comment is as true for social sciences such as economics 
as it is for natural sciences such as physics, most people are not accustomed to 
looking at society through the eyes of a scientist. Let’s discuss some of the ways in 
which economists apply the logic of science to examine how an economy works.
The Scientific Method: Observation,  
Theory, and More Observation
Isaac Newton, the famous 17th-century scientist and mathematician, allegedly 
became intrigued one day when he saw an apple fall from a tree. This observation 
motivated Newton to develop a theory of gravity that applies not only to an apple 
falling to the earth but to any two objects in the universe. Subsequent testing of 
Newton’s theory has shown that it works well in many circumstances (although, 
as Einstein would later emphasize, not in all circumstances). Because Newton’s 
theory has been so successful at explaining observation, it is still taught in under-
graduate physics courses around the world.
This interplay between theory and observation also occurs in the field 
of economics. An economist might live in a country experiencing rapidly 
increasing prices and be moved by this observation to develop a theory of 
inflation. The theory might assert that high inflation arises when the govern-
ment prints too much money. To test this theory, the economist could collect 
and analyze data on prices and money from many different countries. If 
growth in the quantity of money were not at all related to the rate at which 
prices are rising, the economist would start to doubt the validity of this 
theory of inflation. If money growth and inflation were strongly correlated 
in international data, as in fact they are, the economist would become more 
confident in the theory.
Although economists use theory and observation like other scientists, they face 
an obstacle that makes their task especially challenging: In economics, ­conducting 
“I’m a social scientist, 
Michael. That means I 
can’t explain electricity 
or anything like that, 
but if you ever want to 
know about people, I’m 
your man.”

experiments is often difficult and sometimes impossible. Physicists studying 
gravity can drop many objects in their laboratories to generate data to test their 
theories. By contrast, economists studying inflation are not allowed to manipu-
late a nation’s monetary policy simply to generate useful data. Economists, like 
astronomers and evolutionary biologists, usually have to make do with whatever 
data the world happens to give them.
To find a substitute for laboratory experiments, economists pay close atten-
tion to the natural experiments offered by history. When a war in the Middle 
East interrupts the flow of crude oil, for instance, oil prices skyrocket around the 
world. For consumers of oil and oil products, such an event depresses living stan-
dards. For economic policymakers, it poses a difficult choice about how best to 
respond. But for economic scientists, the event provides an opportunity to study 
the effects of a key natural resource on the world’s economies. Throughout this 
book, therefore, we consider many historical episodes. These episodes are valu-
able to study because they give us insight into the economy of the past and, more 
important, because they allow us to illustrate and evaluate economic theories of 
the present.
The Role of Assumptions
If you ask a physicist how long it would take a marble to fall from the top of a ten-
story building, she will likely answer the question by assuming that the marble 
falls in a vacuum. Of course, this assumption is false. In fact, the building is sur-
rounded by air, which exerts friction on the falling marble and slows it down. 
Yet the physicist will point out that the friction on the marble is so small that its 
effect is negligible. Assuming the marble falls in a vacuum simplifies the problem 
without substantially affecting the answer.
Economists make assumptions for the same reason: Assumptions can simplify 
the complex world and make it easier to understand. To study the effects of 
international trade, for example, we might assume that the world consists of only 
two countries and that each country produces only two goods.  In reality, there 
are numerous countries, each of which produces thousands of different types of 
goods. But by assuming two countries and two goods, we can focus our thinking 
on the essence of the problem. Once we understand international trade in this sim-
plified imaginary world, we are in a better position to understand international 
trade in the more complex world in which we live. 
The art in scientific thinking—whether in physics, biology, or economics—is 
deciding which assumptions to make. Suppose, for instance, that instead of drop-
ping  a marble from the top of the building, we were dropping a beachball of the 
same weight. Our physicist would realize that the assumption of no friction is 
less accurate in this case: Friction exerts a greater force on a beachball than on a 
marble because a beachball is much larger. The assumption that gravity works 
in a vacuum is reasonable for studying a falling marble but not for studying a 
falling beachball. 
Similarly, economists use different assumptions to answer different ques-
tions. Suppose that we want to study what happens to the economy when the 
government changes the number of dollars in circulation. An important piece 
of this analysis, it turns out, is how prices respond. Many prices in the economy 
change infrequently; the newsstand prices of magazines, for instance, change only 
every few years. Knowing this fact may lead us to make different assumptions 
when studying the effects of the policy change over different time horizons. For

Introduction
­studying the short-run effects of the policy, we may assume that prices do not 
change much. We may even make the extreme and artificial assumption that all 
prices are completely fixed. For studying the long-run effects of the policy, how-
ever, we may assume that all prices are completely flexible. Just as a physicist 
uses different assumptions when studying falling marbles and falling beachballs, 
economists use different assumptions when studying the short-run and long-run 
effects of a change in the quantity of money.
Economic Models
High school biology teachers teach basic anatomy with plastic replicas of the 
human body. These models have all the major organs: the heart, the liver, the 
kidneys, and so on. The models allow teachers to show their students very 
simply how the important parts of the body fit together. Because these plas-
tic models are stylized and omit many details, no one would mistake one of 
them for a real person. Despite this lack of realism—indeed, because of this 
lack of realism—studying these models is useful for learning how the human 
body works.
Economists also use models to learn about the world, but instead of being 
made of plastic, they are most often composed of diagrams and equations. Like a 
biology teacher’s plastic model, economic models omit many details to allow us to 
see what is truly important. Just as the biology teacher’s model does not include 
all the body’s muscles and capillaries, an economist’s model does not include 
every feature of the economy. 
As we use models to examine various economic issues throughout this book, 
you will see that all the models are built with assumptions. Just as a physicist 
begins the analysis of a falling marble by assuming away the existence of friction, 
economists assume away many of the details of the economy that are irre­le­vant for 
studying the question at hand. All models—in physics, biology, and ­economics—
simplify reality to improve our understanding of it.
Our First Model: The Circular-Flow Diagram
The economy consists of millions of people engaged in many activities—buying, 
selling, working, hiring, manufacturing, and so on. To understand how the economy 
works, we must find some way to simplify our thinking about all these activities. In 
other words, we need a model that explains, in general terms, how the economy is 
organized and how participants in the economy interact with one another.
Figure 1 presents a visual model of the economy called a circular-flow diagram. 
In this model, the economy is simplified to include only two types of decision 
makers—firms and households. Firms produce goods and services using inputs, 
such as labor, land, and capital (buildings and machines). These inputs are called 
the factors of production. Households own the factors of production and consume 
all the goods and services that the firms produce.
Households and firms interact in two types of markets. In the markets for goods 
and services, households are buyers, and firms are sellers. In particular, households 
buy the output of goods and services that firms produce. In the markets for the fac-
tors of production, households are sellers, and firms are buyers. In these markets, 
households provide the inputs that firms use to produce goods and services. The 
circular-flow diagram offers a simple way of organizing the economic transac-
tions that occur between households and firms in the economy. 
The two loops of the circular-flow diagram are distinct but related. The inner 
loop represents the flows of inputs and outputs. The households sell the use of

CHAPTER 2    Thinking Like an Economist
their labor, land, and capital to the firms in the markets for the factors of pro-
duction. The firms then use these factors to produce goods and services, which 
in turn are sold to households in the markets for goods and services. The outer 
loop of the diagram represents the corresponding flow of dollars. The households 
spend money to buy goods and services from the firms. The firms use some of the 
revenue from these sales to pay for the factors of production, such as the wages 
of their workers. What’s left is the profit of the firm owners, who themselves are 
members of households.
Let’s take a tour of the circular flow by following a dollar bill as it makes its 
way from person to person through the economy. Imagine that the dollar begins 
at a household, say, in your wallet. If you want to buy a cup of coffee, you take 
the dollar to one of the economy’s markets for goods and services, such as your 
local Starbucks coffee shop. There, you spend it on your favorite drink. When the 
dollar moves into the Starbucks cash register, it becomes revenue for the firm. 
The dollar doesn’t stay at Starbucks for long, however, because the firm uses it to 
buy inputs in the markets for the factors of production. Starbucks might use the 
dollar to pay rent to its landlord for the space it occupies or to pay the wages of 
its workers. In either case, the dollar enters the income of some household and, 
once again, is back in someone’s wallet. At that point, the story of the economy’s 
circular flow starts once again.
The circular-flow diagram in Figure 1 is a very simple model of the econ-
omy. It dispenses with details that, for some purposes, are significant. A more

Introduction
­complex and realistic circular-flow model would include, for instance, the roles 
of government and international trade. (A portion of that dollar you gave to 
Starbucks might be used to pay taxes or to buy coffee beans from a farmer in 
Brazil.) Yet these details are not crucial for a basic understanding of how the 
economy is organized. Because of its simplicity, this circular-flow diagram is 
useful to keep in mind when thinking about how the pieces of the economy fit 
together. 
Our Second Model: The Production  
Possibilities Frontier 
Most economic models, unlike the circular-flow diagram, are built using the tools 
of mathematics. Here we use one of the simplest such models, called the produc-
tion possibilities frontier, to illustrate some basic economic ideas.
Although real economies produce thousands of goods and services, let’s 
assume an economy that produces only two goods—cars and computers. 
Together, the car industry and the computer industry use all of the economy’s 
factors of production. The production possibilities frontier is a graph that shows 
the various combinations of output—in this case, cars and computers—that the 
economy can possibly produce given the available factors of production and the 
available production technology that firms use to turn these factors into output.
Figure 2 shows this economy’s production possibilities frontier. If the economy 
uses all its resources in the car industry, it produces 1,000 cars and no computers. 
If it uses all its resources in the computer industry, it produces 3,000 computers 
and no cars. The two endpoints of the production possibilities frontier represent 
these extreme possibilities. 
More likely, the economy divides its resources between the two industries, 
producing some cars and some computers. For example, it can produce 600 cars

The Production Possibilities Frontier
The production possibilities frontier 
shows the combinations of output—in 
this case, cars and computers—that the 
economy can possibly produce. The 
economy can produce any combination 
on or inside the frontier. Points outside 
the frontier are not feasible given the 
economy’s resources.

and 2,200 computers, shown in the figure by point A. Or, by moving some of the 
factors of production to the car industry from the computer industry, the economy 
can produce 700 cars and 2,000 computers, represented by point B.
Because resources are scarce, not every conceivable outcome is feasible. For 
example, no matter how resources are allocated between the two industries, 
the economy cannot produce the amount of cars and computers represented by 
point C. Given the technology available for manufacturing cars and computers, 
the economy does not have enough of the factors of production to support that 
level of output. With the resources it has, the economy can produce at any point 
on or inside the production possibilities frontier, but it cannot produce at points 
outside the frontier.
An outcome is said to be efficient if the economy is getting all it can from 
the scarce resources it has available. Points on (rather than inside) the produc-
tion possibilities frontier represent efficient levels of production. When the 
economy is producing at such a point, say point A, there is no way to produce 
more of one good without producing less of the other. Point D represents an 
inefficient outcome. For some reason, perhaps widespread unemployment, the 
economy is producing less than it could from the resources it has available: 
It is producing only 300 cars and 1,000 computers. If the source of the inef-
ficiency is eliminated, the economy can increase its production of both goods. 
For example, if the economy moves from point D to point A, its production of 
cars increases from 300 to 600, and its production of computers increases from 
1,000 to 2,200.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that people face 
trade-offs. The production possibilities frontier shows one trade-off that society 
faces. Once we have reached the efficient points on the frontier, the only way of 
producing more of one good is to produce less of the other. When the economy 
moves from point A to point B, for instance, society produces 100 more cars but 
at the expense of producing 200 fewer computers. 
This trade-off helps us understand another of the Ten Principles of Economics: 
The cost of something is what you give up to get it. This is called the opportunity 
cost. The production possibilities frontier shows the opportunity cost of one 
good as measured in terms of the other good. When society moves from point 
A to point B, it gives up 200 computers to get 100 additional cars. That is, at 
point A, the opportunity cost of 100 cars is 200 computers. Put another way, the 
opportunity cost of each car is two computers. Notice that the opportunity cost 
of a car equals the slope of the production possibilities frontier. (If you don’t 
recall what slope is, you can refresh your memory with the graphing appendix 
to this chapter.)
The opportunity cost of a car in terms of the number of computers is not con-
stant in this economy but depends on how many cars and computers the economy 
is producing. This is reflected in the shape of the production possibilities frontier. 
Because the production possibilities frontier in Figure 2 is bowed outward, the 
opportunity cost of a car is highest when the economy is producing many cars and 
few computers, such as at point E, where the frontier is steep. When the economy 
is producing few cars and many computers, such as at point F, the frontier is 
­flatter, and the opportunity cost of a car is lower.
Economists believe that production possibilities frontiers often have this 
bowed shape. When the economy is using most of its resources to make comput-
ers, such as at point F, the resources best suited to car production, such as skilled

Introduction
autoworkers, are being used in the computer industry. Because these workers 
probably aren’t very good at making computers, the economy won’t have to lose 
much computer production to increase car production by one unit. The opportu-
nity cost of a car in terms of computers is small, and the frontier is relatively flat. 
By contrast, when the economy is using most of its resources to make cars, such as 
at point E, the resources best suited to making cars are already in the car industry. 
Producing an additional car means moving some of the best computer techni-
cians out of the computer industry and making them autoworkers. As a result, 
producing an additional car will mean a substantial loss of computer output. The 
opportunity cost of a car is high, and the frontier is steep.
The production possibilities frontier shows the trade-off between the out-
puts of different goods at a given time, but the trade-off can change over time. 
For example, suppose a technological advance in the computer industry raises 
the number of computers that a worker can produce per week. This advance 
expands society’s set of opportunities. For any given number of cars, the 
economy can make more computers. If the economy does not produce any 
computers, it can still produce 1,000 cars, so one endpoint of the frontier stays 
the same. But the rest of the production possibilities frontier shifts outward, 
as in Figure 3.
This figure illustrates economic growth. Society can move production from a 
point on the old frontier to a point on the new frontier. Which point it chooses 
depends on its preferences for the two goods. In this example, society moves from 
point A to point G, enjoying more computers (2,300 instead of 2,200) and more 
cars (650 instead of 600).
The production possibilities frontier simplifies a complex economy to highlight 
some basic but powerful ideas: scarcity, efficiency, trade-offs, opportunity cost,

moves from point A to point G, then 
the production of both cars and 
computers increases.

and economic growth. As you study economics, these ideas will recur in various 
forms. The production possibilities frontier offers one simple way of thinking 
about them.
Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
Many subjects are studied on various levels. Consider biology, for example. 
Molecular biologists study the chemical compounds that make up living things. 
Cellular biologists study cells, which are made up of many chemical compounds 
and, at the same time, are themselves the building blocks of living organisms. 
Evolutionary biologists study the many varieties of animals and plants and how 
species change gradually over the centuries.
Economics is also studied on various levels. We can study the decisions of indi-
vidual households and firms. Or we can study the interaction of households and 
firms in markets for specific goods and services. Or we can study the operation 
of the economy as a whole, which is the sum of the activities of all these decision 
makers in all these markets.
The field of economics is traditionally divided into two broad subfields. Micro-
economics is the study of how households and firms make decisions and how 
they interact in specific markets. Macroeconomics is the study of economywide 
phenomena. A microeconomist might study the effects of rent control on housing 
in New York City, the impact of foreign competition on the U.S. auto industry, 
or the effects of compulsory school attendance on workers’ earnings. A macro-
economist might study the effects of borrowing by the federal government, the 
changes over time in the economy’s rate of unemployment, or alternative policies 
to promote growth in national living standards.  
Microeconomics and macroeconomics are closely intertwined. Because 
changes in the overall economy arise from the decisions of millions of indi-
viduals, it is impossible to understand macroeconomic developments without 
considering the associated microeconomic decisions. For example, a macroecon-
omist might study the effect of a federal income tax cut on the overall production 
of goods and services. But to analyze this issue, he or she must consider how the 
tax cut affects the decisions of households about how much to spend on goods 
and services. 
Despite the inherent link between microeconomics and macroeconomics, the 
two fields are distinct. Because they address different questions, each field has its 
own set of models, which are often taught in separate courses.

well-being of teenagers? When economists are trying to explain the world, they 
are scientists. When they are trying to help improve it, they are policy advisers.
Positive versus Normative Analysis
To help clarify the two roles that economists play, let’s examine the use of lan-
guage. Because scientists and policy advisers have different goals, they use lan-
guage in different ways.
For example, suppose that two people are discussing minimum-wage laws. 
Here are two statements you might hear:
Polly:	 Minimum-wage laws cause unemployment.
Norm:	 The government should raise the minimum wage.
Ignoring for now whether you agree with these statements, notice that Polly 
and Norm differ in what they are trying to do. Polly is speaking like a scientist: 
She is making a claim about how the world works. Norm is speaking like a pol-
icy adviser: He is making a claim about how he would like to change the world.

CHAPTER 2    Thinking Like an Economist
In general, statements about the world come in two types. One type, such as 
Polly’s, is positive. Positive statements are descriptive. They make a claim about 
how the world is. A second type of statement, such as Norm’s, is normative. Norma-
tive statements are prescriptive. They make a claim about how the world ought to be. 
A key difference between positive and normative statements is how we judge 
their validity. We can, in principle, confirm or refute positive statements by exam-
ining evidence. An economist might evaluate Polly’s statement by analyzing data 
on changes in minimum wages and changes in unemployment over time. By 
contrast, evaluating normative statements involves values as well as facts. Norm’s 
statement cannot be judged using data alone. Deciding what is good or bad policy 
is not just a matter of science. It also involves our views on ethics, religion, and 
political philosophy.
Positive and normative statements are fundamentally different, but they are 
often intertwined in a person’s set of beliefs. In particular, positive views about 
how the world works affect normative views about what policies are desirable. 
Polly’s claim that the minimum wage causes unemployment, if true, might lead 
her to reject Norm’s conclusion that the government should raise the minimum 
wage. Yet normative conclusions cannot come from positive analysis alone; they 
involve value judgments as well.
As you study economics, keep in mind the distinction between positive and 
normative statements because it will help you stay focused on the task at hand. 
Much of economics is positive: It just tries to explain how the economy works. Yet 
those who use economics often have normative goals: They want to learn how to 
improve the economy. When you hear economists making normative statements, 
you know they are speaking not as scientists but as policy advisers.
Economists in Washington
President Harry Truman once said that he wanted to find a one-armed economist. 
When he asked his economists for advice, they always answered, “On the one 
hand, . . . On the other hand, . . . “
Truman was right in realizing that economists’ advice is not always straight-
forward. This tendency is rooted in one of the Ten Principles of Economics: People 
face trade-offs. Economists are aware that trade-offs are involved in most policy 
decisions. A policy might increase efficiency at the cost of equality. It might help 
future generations but hurt current generations. An economist who says that all 
policy decisions are easy is an economist not to be trusted.
Truman was not the only president who relied on the advice of economists. 
Since 1946, the president of the United States has received guidance from the 
Council of Economic Advisers, which consists of three members and a staff of a 
few dozen economists. The council, whose offices are just a few steps from the 
White House, has no duty other than to advise the president and to write the 
annual Economic Report of the President, which discusses recent developments in 
the economy and presents the council’s analysis of current policy issues. 
The president also receives input from economists in many administrative 
departments. Economists at the Office of Management and Budget help formulate 
spending plans and regulatory policies.  Economists at the Department of the Trea-
sury help design tax policy. Economists at the Department of Labor analyze data 
on workers and those looking for work to help formulate labor-market policies. 
Economists at the Department of Justice help enforce the nation’s antitrust laws.
Economists are also found outside the administrative branch of government. 
To obtain independent evaluations of policy proposals, Congress relies on the 
advice of the Congressional Budget Office, which is staffed by economists. The 
normative 
statements
claims that attempt to 
prescribe how the world 
should be
positive statements
claims that attempt to 
describe the world as it is
“Let’s switch. I’ll make 
the policy, you implement 
it, and he’ll explain it.”

Introduction
A Vision for 
Innovation, Growth, 
and Quality Jobs 
By Lawrence H. Summers
P
resident Obama laid out his vision for 
innovation, growth, and quality jobs earlier 
today at Hudson Valley Community College. 
Ths President’s plan is grounded not only in the 
American tradition of ­entrepreneurship, but also 
in the traditions of robust economic thought.
	
During the past two years, the ideas 
propounded by John Maynard Keynes have 
assumed greater importance than most 
people would have thought in the previous 
generation.  As Keynes famously observed, 
during those rare times of deep financial 
and economic crisis, when the “invisible 
hand” Adam Smith talked about has tem-
porarily ceased to function, there is a more 
urgent need for government to play an 
active role in restoring markets to their 
healthy ­function. 
	
The wisdom of Keynesian policies has 
been confirmed by the performance of the econ-
omy over the past year.  After the collapse of 
Lehman Brothers last September, government 
policy moved in a strongly activist direction. 
	
As a result of those policies, our outlook 
today has shifted from rescue to recovery, 
from worrying about the very real prospect 
of depression to thinking about what kind of 
an expansion we want to have. 
	
An important aspect of any economic 
expansion is the role innovation plays as 
 The Economics of President Obama
Here is how Larry Summers, a chief economic adviser to Barack 
Obama, describes the president’s policies.
in the news
Federal Reserve, the institution that sets the nation’s monetary policy, employs 
hundreds of economists to analyze economic developments in the United States 
and throughout the world.
The influence of economists on policy goes beyond their role as advisers: Their 
research and writings often affect policy indirectly. Economist John Maynard 
Keynes offered this observation:
The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right 
and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly under-
stood. Indeed, the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe 
themselves to be quite exempt from intellectual influences, are usually the 
slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices 
in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few 
years back.
Although these words were written in 1935, they remain true. Indeed, the “aca-
demic scribbler” now influencing public policy is often Keynes himself.
Why Economists’ Advice Is Not Always Followed
Any economist who advises presidents or other elected leaders knows that his 
or her recommendations are not always heeded. Frustrating as this can be, it 
is easy to understand. The process by which economic policy is actually made 
differs in many ways from the idealized policy process assumed in economics 
textbooks.

an engine of economic growth.   In this 
regard, the most important economist of 
the twenty-first century might actually turn 
out to be not Smith or Keynes, but Joseph 
Schumpeter. 
	
One of Schumpeter’s most important 
contributions was the emphasis he placed 
on the tremendous power of innovation and 
entrepreneurial initiative to drive growth 
through a process he famously characterized 
as “creative destruction.”   His work cap-
tured not only an economic truth, but also 
the particular source of America’s strength 
and dynamism.
	
One of the ways to view the trajectory 
of economic history is through the key tech-
nologies that have reverberated across the 
economy.  In the nineteenth century, these 
included the transcontinental railroad, the 
telegraph, and the steam engine, among 
others.  In the twentieth, the most powerful 
innovations included the automobile, the jet 
plane, and, over the last generation, infor-
mation technology.
	
While we can’t know exactly where the 
next great area of American innovation will 
be, we already see a number of prominent 
sectors where American entrepreneurs are 
unleashing explosive, innovative energy:
• In information technology, where tremen-
dous potential remains for a range of 
applications to increase for years to come;
• In life-science technologies, where devel-
opments made at the National Institutes 
of Health and in research facilities around 
the country will have profound implica-
tions not just for human health, but also 
for the environment, agriculture, and a 
range of other areas that require techno-
logical creativity; and,
• In energy, where the combination of environ-
mental and geopolitical imperatives have 
created the context for an enormously 
productive period in developing energy 
technologies as well.
	
Looking across the breadth of the U.S. 
economy, the prospects for transformational 
innovation to occur are enormous.  But to ensure 
that the entrepreneurial spirit that Schumpeter 
recognized in the early twentieth century will 
continue to drive the American economy in the 
twenty-first century requires a role for govern-
ment as well: to create an environment that is 
conducive to generating those developments.  
Throughout this text, whenever we discuss economic policy, we often focus on 
one question: What is the best policy for the government to pursue? We act as if 
policy were set by a benevolent king. Once the king figures out the right policy, 
he has no trouble putting his ideas into action.
In the real world, figuring out the right policy is only part of a leader’s job, 
sometimes the easiest part. After a president hears from his economic advisers 
about what policy is best from their perspective, he turns to other advisers for 
related input. His communications advisers will tell him how best to explain 
the proposed policy to the public, and they will try to anticipate any misunder-
standings that might make the challenge more difficult. His press advisers will 
tell him how the news media will report on his proposal and what opinions 
will likely be expressed on the nation’s editorial pages. His legislative affairs 
advisers will tell him how Congress will view the proposal, what amendments 
members of Congress will suggest, and the likelihood that Congress will pass 
some version of the president’s proposal into law. His political advisers will tell 
him which groups will organize to support or oppose the proposed policy, how 
this proposal will affect his standing among different groups in the electorate, 
and whether it will affect support for any of the president’s other policy initia-
tives. After hearing and weighing all this advice, the president then decides 
how to proceed.
Making economic policy in a representative democracy is a messy affair—and 
there are often good reasons presidents (and other politicians) do not advance the

Introduction
policies that economists advocate. Economists offer crucial input into the policy 
process, but their advice is only one ingredient of a complex recipe. 
Quick Quiz  Give an example of a positive statement and an example of a norma-
tive statement that somehow relates to your daily life.  •  Name three parts of govern-
ment that regularly rely on advice from economists.
Why Economists Disagree
“If all economists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion.” This 
quip from George Bernard Shaw is revealing. Economists as a group are often 
criticized for giving conflicting advice to policymakers. President Ronald Reagan 
once joked that if the game Trivial Pursuit were designed for economists, it would 
have 100 questions and 3,000 answers.
Why do economists so often appear to give conflicting advice to policymakers? 
There are two basic reasons:
• 	 Economists may disagree about the validity of alternative positive theories 
about how the world works.
• 	 Economists may have different values and therefore different normative 
views about what policy should try to accomplish.
Let’s discuss each of these reasons.
Differences in Scientific Judgments
Several centuries ago, astronomers debated whether the earth or the sun was at the 
center of the solar system. More recently, meteorologists have debated whether 
the earth is experiencing global warming and, if so, why. Science is a search for 
understanding about the world around us. It is not surprising that as the search 
continues, scientists can disagree about the direction in which truth lies.
Economists often disagree for the same reason. Economics is a young science, 
and there is still much to be learned. Economists sometimes disagree because they 
have different hunches about the validity of alternative theories or about the size 
of important parameters that measure how economic variables are related.
For example, economists disagree about whether the government should tax 
a household’s income or its consumption (spending). Advocates of a switch 
from the current income tax to a consumption tax believe that the change would 
encourage households to save more because income that is saved would not be 
taxed. Higher saving, in turn, would free resources for capital accumulation, 
leading to more rapid growth in productivity and living standards. Advocates of 
the current income tax system believe that household saving would not respond 
much to a change in the tax laws. These two groups of economists hold different 
normative views about the tax system because they have different positive views 
about the responsiveness of saving to tax incentives.
Differences in Values
Suppose that Peter and Paula both take the same amount of water from the town 
well. To pay for maintaining the well, the town taxes its residents. Peter has 
income of $100,000 and is taxed $10,000, or 10 percent of his income. Paula has 
income of $20,000 and is taxed $4,000, or 20 percent of her income.

CHAPTER 2    Thinking Like an Economist
Is this policy fair? If not, who pays too much and who pays too little? Does it 
matter whether Paula’s low income is due to a medical disability or to her deci-
sion to pursue an acting career? Does it matter whether Peter’s high income is 
due to a large inheritance or to his willingness to work long hours at a dreary job?
These are difficult questions on which people are likely to disagree. If the town 
hired two experts to study how the town should tax its residents to pay for the 
well, we would not be surprised if they offered conflicting advice.
This simple example shows why economists sometimes disagree about public 
policy. As we learned earlier in our discussion of normative and positive analysis, 
policies cannot be judged on scientific grounds alone. Economists give conflicting 
advice sometimes because they have different values. Perfecting the science of 
economics will not tell us whether Peter or Paula pays too much.  
Perception versus Reality
Because of differences in scientific judgments and differences in values, some 
disagreement among economists is inevitable. Yet one should not overstate the 
amount of disagreement. Economists agree with one another far more than is 
sometimes understood. 
Table 1 contains 20 propositions about economic policy. In surveys of profes-
sional economists, these propositions were endorsed by an overwhelming major-
ity of respondents. Most of these propositions would fail to command a similar 
consensus among the public. 
The first proposition in the table is about rent control, a policy that sets a legal 
maximum on the amount landlords can charge for their apartments. Almost all 
economists believe that rent control adversely affects the availability and quality 
of housing and is a costly way of helping the neediest members of society. None-
theless, many city governments ignore the advice of economists and place ceilings 
on the rents that landlords may charge their tenants.
The second proposition in the table concerns tariffs and import quotas, two poli-
cies that restrict trade among nations. For reasons we discuss more fully later in this 
text, almost all economists oppose such barriers to free trade. Nonetheless, over the 
years, presidents and Congress have chosen to restrict the import of certain goods.
Why do policies such as rent control and trade barriers persist if the experts are 
united in their opposition? It may be that the realities of the political process stand 
as immovable obstacles. But it also may be that economists have not yet convinced 
enough of the public that these policies are undesirable. One purpose of this book 
is to help you understand the economist’s view of these and other subjects and, 
perhaps, to persuade you that it is the right one.
Quick Quiz  Why might economic advisers to the president disagree about a ques-
tion of policy?
Let’s Get Going
The first two chapters of this book have introduced you to the ideas and meth-
ods of economics. We are now ready to get to work. In the next chapter, we start 
learning in more detail the principles of economic behavior and economic policy. 
As you proceed through this book, you will be asked to draw on many of your 
intellectual skills. You might find it helpful to keep in mind some advice from the 
great economist John Maynard Keynes:

Introduction
The study of economics does not seem to require any specialized gifts of an 
unusually high order. Is it not . . . a very easy subject compared with the higher 
branches of philosophy or pure science? An easy subject, at which very few 
excel! The paradox finds its explanation, perhaps, in that the master-economist 
must possess a rare combination of gifts. He must be mathematician, historian, 
statesman, philosopher—in some degree. He must understand symbols and 
speak in words. He must contemplate the particular in terms of the general, 
and touch abstract and concrete in the same flight of thought. He must study 
the present in the light of the past for the purposes of the future. No part 
of man’s nature or his institutions must lie entirely outside his regard. He 
must be purposeful and disinterested in a simultaneous mood; as aloof and 
­incorruptible as an artist, yet sometimes as near the earth as a politician.
It is a tall order. But with practice, you will become more and more accustomed 
to thinking like an economist.

 Environmental Economics
Some economists are helping to save the planet.

Potent Tool in 
Economics

M
any economists dream of getting 
high-paying jobs on Wall Street, at 
prestigious think tanks and universities or 
at powerful government agencies like the 
Federal Reserve.
	
But a growing number are choosing 
to use their skills not to track inflation or 
interest rates but to rescue rivers and trees. 
These are the “green economists,” more 
formally known as environmental econo-
mists, who use economic arguments and 
systems to persuade companies to clean 
up pollution and to help conserve natural 
areas.
	
Working at dozens of advocacy groups 
and a myriad of state and federal envi-
ronmental agencies, they are helping to 
formulate the intellectual framework behind 
approaches to protecting endangered spe-
cies, reducing pollution and preventing cli-
mate change. They also are becoming a link 
between left-leaning advocacy groups and 
the public and private sectors.
	
“In the past, many advocacy groups 
interpreted economics as how to make a 
profit or maximize income,” says Lawrence 
Goulder, a professor of environmental and 
resource economics at Stanford University 
in Stanford, Calif. “More economists are 
­realizing that it offers a framework for 
resource allocation where resources are not 
only labor and capital but natural resources 
as well.”
	
Environmental economists are on 
the payroll of government agencies (the 
Environmental Protection Agency had 
about 164 on staff in 2004, up 36% 
from 1995) and groups like the Wilderness 
Society, a Washington-based conservation 
group, which has four of them to work 
on projects such as assessing the eco-
nomic impact of building off-road driving 
trails. Environmental Defense, also based in 
Washington, was one of the first environ-
mental-advocacy groups to hire economists 
and now has about eight, who do such 
things as develop market incentives to 
address environmental problems like climate 
change and water shortages. . . .
	
“There used to be this idea that we 
shouldn’t have to monetize the environment 
because it is invaluable,” says Caroline 
Alkire, who in 1991 joined the Wilderness 
Society, an advocacy group in Washington, 
D.C., as one of the group’s first economists. 
“But if we are going to engage in debate on 
the Hill about drilling in the Arctic we need 
to be able to combat the financial argu-
ments. We have to play that card or we are 
going to lose.”
	
The field of environmental economics 
began to take form in the 1960s when 
academics started to apply the tools of 
economics to the nascent green movement. 
The discipline grew more popular through-
out the 1980s when the Environmental 
Protection Agency adopted a system of trad-
able permits for phasing out leaded gaso-
line. It wasn’t until the 1990 amendment 
to the Clean Air Act, however, that most 
environmentalists started to take economics 
seriously.
	
The amendment implemented a system 
of tradable allowances for acid rain, a 
program pushed by Environmental Defense. 
Under the law, plants that can reduce their 
emissions more cost-effectively may sell 
their allowances to more heavy polluters. 
Today, the program has exceeded its goal 
of reducing the amount of acid rain to half 
its 1980 level and is celebrated as evidence 
that markets can help achieve environmen-
tal goals.
	
Its success has convinced its former 
critics, who at the time contended that 
environmental regulation was a matter of 
ethics, not economics, and favored installing 
expensive acid rain removal technology in 
all power plants instead.
	
Greenpeace, the international environ-
mental giant, was one of the leading oppo-
nents of the 1990 amendment. But Kert 
Davies, research director for Greenpeace 
USA, said its success and the lack of any 
significant action on climate policy through-
out [the] early 1990s brought the organi-
zation around to the concept. “We now 
believe that [tradable permits] are the most 
straightforward system of reducing emis-
sions and creating the incentives necessary 
for massive reductions.”

• Economists try to address their subject with a 
scientist’s objectivity. Like all scientists, they 
make appropriate assumptions and build sim-
plified models to understand the world around 
them. Two simple economic models are the 
circular-flow diagram and the production pos-
sibilities frontier.
• The field of economics is divided into two 
subfields: microeconomics and macroeconom-
ics. Microeconomists study decision making 
by households and firms and the interaction 
among households and firms in the marketplace. 
Macroeconomists study the forces and trends 
that affect the economy as a whole. 
• A positive statement is an assertion about 
how the world is. A normative statement is 
an assertion about how the world ought to be. 
When economists make normative statements, 
they are acting more as policy advisers than 
scientists.
• Economists who advise policymakers offer con-
flicting advice either because of differences in 
scientific judgments or because of differences 
in values. At other times, economists are united 
in the advice they offer, but policymakers may 
choose to ignore it.

Appendix
Graphing: A Brief Review
Many of the concepts that economists study can be expressed with numbers—the 
price of bananas, the quantity of bananas sold, the cost of growing bananas, and 
so on. Often, these economic variables are related to one another: When the price 
of bananas rises, people buy fewer bananas. One way of expressing the relation-
ships among variables is with graphs. 
Graphs serve two purposes. First, when developing economic theories, graphs 
offer a way to visually express ideas that might be less clear if described with 
equations or words. Second, when analyzing economic data, graphs provide a 
powerful way of finding and interpreting patterns. Whether we are working with 
theory or with data, graphs provide a lens through which a recognizable forest 
emerges from a multitude of trees.
Numerical information can be expressed graphically in many ways, just as 
there are many ways to express a thought in words. A good writer chooses words 
that will make an argument clear, a description pleasing, or a scene dramatic. An 
effective economist chooses the type of graph that best suits the purpose at hand. 
In this appendix, we discuss how economists use graphs to study the mathe­
matical relationships among variables. We also discuss some of the pitfalls that 
can arise in the use of graphical methods.
Graphs of a Single Variable

income for four countries. The height of each bar represents the average income 
in each country. The time-series graph in panel (c) traces the rising productivity in 
the U.S. business sector over time. The height of the line shows output per hour in 
each year. You have probably seen similar graphs in newspapers and magazines.
Graphs of Two Variables: The Coordinate System
The three graphs in Figure A-1 are useful in showing how a variable changes 
over time or across individuals, but they are limited in how much they can tell us. 
These graphs display information only on a single variable. Economists are often 
concerned with the relationships between variables. Thus, they need to display 
two variables on a single graph. The coordinate system makes this possible. 
Suppose you want to examine the relationship between study time and grade 
point average. For each student in your class, you could record a pair of numbers: 
hours per week spent studying and grade point average. These numbers could 
then be placed in parentheses as an ordered pair and appear as a single point on the 
graph. Albert E., for instance, is represented by the ordered pair (25 hours/week, 
3.5 GPA), while his “what-me-worry?” classmate Alfred E. is represented by the 
ordered pair (5 hours/week, 2.0 GPA). 
We can graph these ordered pairs on a two-dimensional grid. The first number 
in each ordered pair, called the x-coordinate, tells us the horizontal location of the 
point. The second number, called the y-coordinate, tells us the vertical location 
of the point. The point with both an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate of zero is 
known as the origin. The two coordinates in the ordered pair tell us where the 
point is located in relation to the origin: x units to the right of the origin and y 
units above it.
Figure A-2 graphs grade point average against study time for Albert E., Alfred E., 
and their classmates. This type of graph is called a scatterplot because it plots 
scattered points. Looking at this graph, we immediately notice that points farther

study more tend to get higher 
grades.

Introduction
to the right (indicating more study time) also tend to be higher (indicating a better 
grade point average). Because study time and grade point average typically move 
in the same direction, we say that these two variables have a positive correlation. 
By contrast, if we were to graph party time and grades, we would likely find that 
higher party time is associated with lower grades; because these variables typi-
cally move in opposite directions, we call this a negative correlation. In either case, 
the coordinate system makes the correlation between the two variables easy to see. 
Curves in the Coordinate System
Students who study more do tend to get higher grades, but other factors also influ-
ence a student’s grade. Previous preparation is an important factor, for instance, 
as are talent, attention from teachers, even eating a good breakfast. A scatterplot 
like Figure A-2 does not attempt to isolate the effect that studying has on grades 
from the effects of other variables. Often, however, economists prefer looking at 
how one variable affects another, holding everything else constant.
To see how this is done, let’s consider one of the most important graphs in eco-
nomics: the demand curve. The demand curve traces out the effect of a good’s price 
on the quantity of the good consumers want to buy. Before showing a demand 
curve, however, consider Table A-1, which shows how the number of novels that 
Emma buys depends on her income and on the price of novels. When novels are 
cheap, Emma buys them in large quantities. As they become more expensive, she 
instead borrows books from the library or chooses to go to the movies rather than 
read. Similarly, at any given price, Emma buys more novels when she has a higher 
income. That is, when her income increases, she spends part of the additional 
income on novels and part on other goods.
We now have three variables—the price of novels, income, and the number 
of novels purchased—which are more than we can represent in two dimensions. 
To put the information from Table A-1 in graphical form, we need to hold one of 
the three variables constant and trace out the relationship between the other two. 
Because the demand curve represents the relationship between price and quantity 
demanded, we hold Emma’s income constant and show how the number of nov-
els she buys varies with the price of novels. 
Suppose that Emma’s income is $30,000 per year. If we place the number of 
novels Emma purchases on the x-axis and the price of novels on the y-axis, we

This table shows the number 
of novels Emma buys at various 
incomes and prices. For any given 
level of income, the data on 
price and quantity demanded can 
be graphed to produce Emma’s 
demand curve for novels, as shown 
in Figures A-3 and A-4.

can graphically represent the middle column of Table A-1. When the points that 
­represent these entries from the table—(5 novels, $10), (9 novels, $9), and so on—are 
connected, they form a line. This line, pictured in Figure A-3, is known as Emma’s 
demand curve for novels; it tells us how many novels Emma purchases at any 
given price. The demand curve is downward sloping, indicating that a higher price 
reduces the quantity of novels demanded. Because the quantity of novels demanded 
and the price move in opposite directions, we say that the two variables are nega-
tively related. (Conversely, when two variables move in the same direction, the curve 
relating them is upward sloping, and we say the variables are positively related.)
Now suppose that Emma’s income rises to $40,000 per year. At any given price, 
Emma will purchase more novels than she did at her previous level of income. 
Just as earlier we drew Emma’s demand curve for novels using the entries from 
the middle column of Table A-1, we now draw a new demand curve using the 
entries from the right column of the table. This new demand curve (curve D2) is 
pictured alongside the old one (curve D1) in Figure A-4; the new curve is a similar 
line drawn farther to the right. We therefore say that Emma’s demand curve for 
novels shifts to the right when her income increases. Likewise, if Emma’s income 
were to fall to $20,000 per year, she would buy fewer novels at any given price 
and her demand curve would shift to the left (to curve D3).
In economics, it is important to distinguish between movements along a curve 
and shifts of a curve. As we can see from Figure A-3, if Emma earns $30,000 per 
year and novels cost $8 apiece, she will purchase 13 novels per year. If the price of 
novels falls to $7, Emma will increase her purchases of novels to 17 per year. The 
demand curve, however, stays fixed in the same place. Emma still buys the same

The line D1 shows how 
Emma’s purchases of novels 
depend on the price of novels 
when her income is held 
constant. Because the price 
and the quantity demanded 
are negatively related, 
the demand curve slopes 
downward.

Introduction
number of novels at each price, but as the price falls, she moves along her demand 
curve from left to right. By contrast, if the price of novels remains fixed at $8 but 
her income rises to $40,000, Emma increases her purchases of novels from 13 to 16 
per year. Because Emma buys more novels at each price, her demand curve shifts 
out, as shown in Figure A-4.
There is a simple way to tell when it is necessary to shift a curve: When a vari-
able that is not named on either axis changes, the curve shifts. Income is on neither 
the x-axis nor the y-axis of the graph, so when Emma’s income changes, her 
demand curve must shift. The same is true for any change that affects Emma’s 
purchasing habits besides a change in the price of novels. If, for instance, the 
public library closes and Emma must buy all the books she wants to read, she 
will demand more novels at each price, and her demand curve will shift to the 
right. Or if the price of movies falls and Emma spends more time at the mov-
ies and less time reading, she will demand fewer novels at each price, and her 
demand curve will shift to the left. By contrast, when a variable on an axis of 
the graph changes, the curve does not shift. We read the change as a movement 
along the curve. 
Slope
One question we might want to ask about Emma is how much her purchasing 
habits respond to price. Look at the demand curve pictured in Figure A-5. If this 
curve is very steep, Emma purchases nearly the same number of novels ­regardless

Shifting Demand Curves
The location of Emma’s 
demand curve for novels 
depends on how much 
income she earns. The more 
she earns, the more novels 
she will purchase at any given 
price, and the farther to 
the right her demand curve 
will lie. Curve D1 represents 
Emma’s original demand 
curve when her income 
is $30,000 per year. If her 
income rises to $40,000 per 
year, her demand curve shifts 
to D2. If her income falls to 
$20,000 per year, her demand 
curve shifts to D3.

of whether they are cheap or expensive. If this curve is much flatter, the number 
of novels Emma purchases is more sensitive to changes in the price. To answer 
questions about how much one variable responds to changes in another variable, 
we can use the concept of slope.
The slope of a line is the ratio of the vertical distance covered to the horizontal 
distance covered as we move along the line. This definition is usually written out 
in mathematical symbols as follows:
slope =
Δy
Δx ,
where the Greek letter ∆ (delta) stands for the change in a variable. In other words, 
the slope of a line is equal to the “rise” (change in y) divided by the “run” (change 
in x). The slope will be a small positive number for a fairly flat upward-sloping 
line, a large positive number for a steep upward-sloping line, and a negative num-
ber for a downward-sloping line. A horizontal line has a slope of zero because in 
this case the y-variable never changes; a vertical line is said to have an infinite 
slope because the y-variable can take any value without the x-variable changing 
at all.
What is the slope of Emma’s demand curve for novels? First of all, because the 
curve slopes down, we know the slope will be negative. To calculate a numerical 
value for the slope, we must choose two points on the line. With Emma’s income

Calculating the Slope

To calculate the slope of the 
demand curve, we can look 
at the changes in the x- and 
y-coordinates as we move 
from the point (21 novels, 
$6) to the point (13 novels, 
$8). The slope of the line is 
the ratio of the change in

change in the x-coordinate

Introduction
at $30,000, she will purchase 21 novels at a price of $6 or 13 novels at a price of 
$8. When we apply the slope formula, we are concerned with the change between 
these two points; in other words, we are concerned with the difference between 
them, which lets us know that we will have to subtract one set of values from the 
other, as follows:
slope =

Figure A-5 shows graphically how this calculation works. Try computing the 
slope of Emma’s demand curve using two different points. You should get exactly 
the same result, 1⁄4. One of the properties of a straight line is that it has the same 
slope everywhere. This is not true of other types of curves, which are steeper in 
some places than in others.
The slope of Emma’s demand curve tells us something about how responsive 
her purchases are to changes in the price. A small slope (a number close to zero) 
means that Emma’s demand curve is relatively flat; in this case, she adjusts the 
number of novels she buys substantially in response to a price change. A larger 
slope (a number farther from zero) means that Emma’s demand curve is relatively 
steep; in this case, she adjusts the number of novels she buys only slightly in 
response to a price change. 
Cause and Effect
Economists often use graphs to advance an argument about how the economy 
works. In other words, they use graphs to argue about how one set of events 
causes another set of events. With a graph like the demand curve, there is no 
doubt about cause and effect. Because we are varying price and holding all other 
variables constant, we know that changes in the price of novels cause changes in 
the quantity Emma demands. Remember, however, that our demand curve came 
from a hypothetical example. When graphing data from the real world, it is often 
more difficult to establish how one variable affects another.
The first problem is that it is difficult to hold everything else constant when 
studying the relationship between two variables. If we are not able to hold other 
variables constant, we might decide that one variable on our graph is causing 
changes in the other variable when actually those changes are caused by a third 
omitted variable not pictured on the graph. Even if we have identified the correct

CHAPTER 2    Thinking Like an Economist
two variables to look at, we might run into a second problem—reverse causality. 
In other words, we might decide that A causes B when in fact B causes A. The 
omitted-variable and reverse-causality traps require us to proceed with caution 
when using graphs to draw conclusions about causes and effects.
Omitted Variables  To see how omitting a variable can lead to a deceptive 
graph, let’s consider an example. Imagine that the government, spurred by 
public concern about the large number of deaths from cancer, commissions 
an exhaustive study from Big Brother Statistical Services, Inc. Big Brother 
examines many of the items found in people’s homes to see which of them 
are associated with the risk of cancer. Big Brother reports a strong relation-
ship between two variables: the number of cigarette lighters that a household 
owns and the probability that someone in the household will develop cancer. 
Figure A-6 shows this relationship. 
What should we make of this result? Big Brother advises a quick policy 
response. It recommends that the government discourage the ownership of 
­cigarette ­lighters by taxing their sale. It also recommends that the government 
require warning labels: “Big Brother has determined that this lighter is danger-
ous to your health.” 
In judging the validity of Big Brother’s analysis, one question is paramount: 
Has Big Brother held constant every relevant variable except the one under 
consideration? If the answer is no, the results are suspect. An easy explanation 
for Figure A-6 is that people who own more cigarette lighters are more likely to 
smoke cigarettes and that cigarettes, not lighters, cause cancer. If Figure A-6 does 
not hold constant the amount of smoking, it does not tell us the true effect of own-
ing a cigarette lighter. 
This story illustrates an important principle: When you see a graph used to 
support an argument about cause and effect, it is important to ask whether the 
movements of an omitted variable could explain the results you see.
Reverse Causality  Economists can also make mistakes about causality by 
misreading its direction. To see how this is possible, suppose the Association of 
American Anarchists commissions a study of crime in America and arrives at 
Figure A-6
Risk of
Cancer

Graph with an Omitted Variable
The upward-sloping curve shows 
that members of households 
with more cigarette lighters are 
more likely to develop cancer. 
Yet we should not conclude that 
ownership of lighters causes 
cancer because the graph does not

PART I	
Introduction
Figure A-7, which plots the number of violent crimes per thousand people in 
major cities against the number of police officers per thousand people. The anar-
chists note the curve’s upward slope and argue that because police increase rather 
than decrease the amount of urban violence, law enforcement should be abolished.
If we could run a controlled experiment, we would avoid the danger of reverse 
causality. To run an experiment, we would set the number of police officers in dif-
ferent cities randomly and then examine the correlation between police and crime. 
Figure A-7, however, is not based on such an experiment. We simply observe that 
more dangerous cities have more police officers. The explanation for this may be 
that more dangerous cities hire more police. In other words, rather than police 
causing crime, crime may cause police. Nothing in the graph itself allows us to 
establish the direction of causality.
It might seem that an easy way to determine the direction of causality is to 
examine which variable moves first. If we see crime increase and then the police 
force expand, we reach one conclusion. If we see the police force expand and then 
crime increase, we reach the other. Yet there is also a flaw with this approach: 
Often, people change their behavior not in response to a change in their present 
conditions but in response to a change in their expectations of future conditions. A 
city that expects a major crime wave in the future, for instance, might hire more 
police now. This problem is even easier to see in the case of babies and minivans. 
Couples often buy a minivan in anticipation of the birth of a child. The minivan 
comes before the baby, but we wouldn’t want to conclude that the sale of mini-
vans causes the population to grow!
There is no complete set of rules that says when it is appropriate to draw causal 
conclusions from graphs. Yet just keeping in mind that cigarette lighters don’t 
cause cancer (omitted variable) and minivans don’t cause larger families (reverse 
causality) will keep you from falling for many faulty economic arguments.

Graph Suggesting Reverse 
Causality
The upward-sloping curve 
shows that cities with a higher 
concentration of police are more 
dangerous. Yet the graph does 
not tell us whether police cause 
crime or crime-plagued cities hire 
more police.
