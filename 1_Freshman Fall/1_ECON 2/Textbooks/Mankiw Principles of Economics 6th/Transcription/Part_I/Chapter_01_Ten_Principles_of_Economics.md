Ten Principles of 
    Economics
T
he word economy comes from the Greek word oikonomos, which means 
“one who manages a household.” At first, this origin might seem pecu-
liar. But in fact, households and economies have much in common. 
A household faces many decisions. It must decide which members of 
the household do which tasks and what each member gets in return: Who cooks 
dinner? Who does the laundry? Who gets the extra dessert at dinner? Who gets to 
choose what TV show to watch? In short, the household must allocate its scarce 
resources among its various members, taking into account each member’s abili-
ties, efforts, and desires. 
Like a household, a society faces many decisions. A society must find some 
way to decide what jobs will be done and who will do them. It needs some people 
to grow food, other people to make clothing, and still others to design computer 
software. Once society has allocated people (as well as land, buildings, and 
machines) to various jobs, it must also allocate the output of goods and services

Introduction
they produce. It must decide who will eat caviar and who will eat potatoes. It 
must decide who will drive a Ferrari and who will take the bus.
The management of society’s resources is important because resources are 
scarce. Scarcity means that society has limited resources and therefore cannot 
produce all the goods and services people wish to have. Just as each member of 
a household cannot get everything he or she wants, each individual in a society 
cannot attain the highest standard of living to which he or she might aspire.
Economics is the study of how society manages its scarce resources. In most 
societies, resources are allocated not by an all-powerful dictator but through the 
combined actions of millions of households and firms. Economists therefore study 
how people make decisions: how much they work, what they buy, how much they 
save, and how they invest their savings. Economists also study how people inter-
act with one another. For instance, they examine how the multitude of buyers and 
sellers of a good together determine the price at which the good is sold and the 
quantity that is sold. Finally, economists analyze forces and trends that affect the 
economy as a whole, including the growth in average income, the fraction of 
the population that cannot find work, and the rate at which prices are rising.
The study of economics has many facets, but it is unified by several central 
ideas. In this chapter, we look at Ten Principles of Economics. Don’t worry if you 
don’t understand them all at first or if you aren’t completely convinced. We will 
explore these ideas more fully in later chapters. The ten principles are introduced 
here to give you an overview of what economics is all about. Consider this chapter 
a “preview of coming attractions.”
How People Make Decisions
There is no mystery to what an economy is. Whether we are talking about the 
economy of Los Angeles, the United States, or the whole world, an economy 
is just a group of people dealing with one another as they go about their lives. 
Because the behavior of an economy reflects the behavior of the individuals who 
make up the economy, we begin our study of economics with four principles of 
individual decision making.
Principle 1: People Face Trade-offs
You may have heard the old saying, “There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch.” 
Grammar aside, there is much truth to this adage. To get one thing that we like, 
we usually have to give up another thing that we like. Making decisions requires 
trading off one goal against another.
Consider a student who must decide how to allocate her most valuable 
resource—her time. She can spend all her time studying economics, spend all of 
it studying psychology, or divide it between the two fields. For every hour she 
studies one subject, she gives up an hour she could have used studying the other. 
And for every hour she spends studying, she gives up an hour that she could have 
spent napping, bike riding, watching TV, or working at her part-time job for some 
extra spending money.
Or consider parents deciding how to spend their family income. They can buy 
food, clothing, or a family vacation. Or they can save some of the family income 
for retirement or the children’s college education. When they choose to spend an 
extra dollar on one of these goods, they have one less dollar to spend on some 
other good.

CHAPTER 1    Ten Principles of Economics
When people are grouped into societies, they face different kinds of trade-offs. 
One classic trade-off is between “guns and butter.” The more a society spends 
on national defense (guns) to protect its shores from foreign aggressors, the less 
it can spend on consumer goods (butter) to raise the standard of living at home. 
Also important in modern society is the trade-off between a clean environment 
and a high level of income. Laws that require firms to reduce pollution raise the 
cost of producing goods and services. Because of the higher costs, these firms end 
up earning smaller profits, paying lower wages, charging higher prices, or some 
combination of these three. Thus, while pollution regulations yield the benefit of 
a cleaner environment and the improved health that comes with it, the regulations 
come at the cost of reducing the incomes of the regulated firms’ owners, workers, 
and customers.
Another trade-off society faces is between efficiency and equality. Efficiency 
means that society is getting the maximum benefits from its scarce resources. 
Equality means that those benefits are distributed uniformly among society’s 
members. In other words, efficiency refers to the size of the economic pie, and 
equality refers to how the pie is divided into individual slices. 
When government policies are designed, these two goals often conflict. Con-
sider, for instance, policies aimed at equalizing the distribution of economic 
well-being. Some of these policies, such as the welfare system or unemployment 
insurance, try to help the members of society who are most in need. Others, such 
as the individual income tax, ask the financially successful to contribute more than 
others to support the government. While achieving greater equality, these policies 
reduce efficiency. When the government redistributes income from the rich to the 
poor, it reduces the reward for working hard; as a result, people work less and 
produce fewer goods and services. In other words, when the government tries to 
cut the economic pie into more equal slices, the pie gets smaller.
Recognizing that people face trade-offs does not by itself tell us what decisions 
they will or should make. A student should not abandon the study of psychol-
ogy just because doing so would increase the time available for the study of 
economics. Society should not stop protecting the environment just because envi-
ronmental regulations reduce our material standard of living. The poor should 
not be ignored just because helping them distorts work incentives. Nonetheless, 
people are likely to make good decisions only if they understand the options they 
have available. Our study of economics, therefore, starts by acknowledging life’s 
trade-offs.
Principle 2: The Cost of Something Is  
What You Give Up to Get It
Because people face trade-offs, making decisions requires comparing the costs 
and benefits of alternative courses of action. In many cases, however, the cost of 
an action is not as obvious as it might first appear. 
Consider the decision to go to college. The main benefits are intellectual enrich-
ment and a lifetime of better job opportunities. But what are the costs? To answer 
this question, you might be tempted to add up the money you spend on tuition, 
books, room, and board. Yet this total does not truly represent what you give up 
to spend a year in college.
There are two problems with this calculation. First, it includes some things 
that are not really costs of going to college. Even if you quit school, you need a 
place to sleep and food to eat. Room and board are costs of going to college only 
to the extent that they are more expensive at college than elsewhere. Second, this 
efficiency 
the property of society 
getting the most it can 
from its scarce resources
equality 
the property of distrib­
uting economic prosperity 
uniformly among the 
members of society

Introduction
­calculation ignores the largest cost of going to college—your time. When you 
spend a year listening to lectures, reading textbooks, and writing papers, you can-
not spend that time working at a job. For most students, the earnings given up to 
attend school are the largest single cost of their education.
The opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to get that item. When 
making any decision, decision makers should be aware of the opportunity costs 
that accompany each possible action. In fact, they usually are. College athletes 
who can earn millions if they drop out of school and play professional sports are 
well aware that their opportunity cost of college is very high. It is not surprising 
that they often decide that the benefit of a college education is not worth the cost.
Principle 3: Rational People Think at the Margin
Economists normally assume that people are rational. Rational people systemati-
cally and purposefully do the best they can to achieve their objectives, given the 
available opportunities. As you study economics, you will encounter firms that 
decide how many workers to hire and how much of their product to manufacture 
and sell to maximize profits. You will also encounter individuals who decide how 
much time to spend working and what goods and services to buy with the result-
ing income to achieve the highest possible level of satisfaction.
Rational people know that decisions in life are rarely black and white but usu-
ally involve shades of gray. At dinnertime, the decision you face is not between 
fasting or eating like a pig but whether to take that extra spoonful of mashed pota-
toes. When exams roll around, your decision is not between blowing them off or 
studying 24 hours a day but whether to spend an extra hour reviewing your notes 
instead of watching TV. Economists use the term marginal change to describe 
a small incremental adjustment to an existing plan of action. Keep in mind that 
margin means “edge,” so marginal changes are adjustments around the edges of 
what you are doing. Rational people often make decisions by comparing marginal 
benefits and marginal costs.
For example, consider an airline deciding how much to charge passengers who 
fly standby. Suppose that flying a 200-seat plane across the United States costs the 
airline $100,000. In this case, the average cost of each seat is $100,000/200, which is 
$500. One might be tempted to conclude that the airline should never sell a ticket 
for less than $500. Actually, a rational airline can often find ways to raise its profits 
by thinking at the margin. Imagine that a plane is about to take off with ten empty 
seats, and a standby passenger waiting at the gate will pay $300 for a seat. Should 
the airline sell the ticket? Of course it should. If the plane has empty seats, the cost 
of adding one more passenger is tiny. Although the average cost of flying a pas-
senger is $500, the marginal cost is merely the cost of the bag of peanuts and can 
of soda that the extra passenger will consume. As long as the standby passenger 
pays more than the marginal cost, selling the ticket is profitable.
Marginal decision making can help explain some otherwise puzzling eco-
nomic phenomena. Here is a classic question: Why is water so cheap, while 
diamonds are so expensive? Humans need water to survive, while diamonds 
are unnecessary; but for some reason, people are willing to pay much more for 
a diamond than for a cup of water. The reason is that a person’s willingness to 
pay for a good is based on the marginal benefit that an extra unit of the good 
would yield. The marginal benefit, in turn, depends on how many units a person 
already has. Water is essential, but the marginal benefit of an extra cup is small 
because water is plentiful. By contrast, no one needs diamonds to survive, but 
because diamonds are so rare, people consider the marginal benefit of an extra 
diamond to be large.

CHAPTER 1    Ten Principles of Economics
A rational decision maker takes an action if and only if the marginal benefit of the 
action exceeds the marginal cost. This principle can explain why airlines are will-
ing to sell a ticket below average cost and why people are willing to pay more for 
diamonds than for water. It can take some time to get used to the logic of marginal 
thinking, but the study of economics will give you ample opportunity to practice.
Principle 4: People Respond to Incentives
An incentive is something that induces a person to act, such as the prospect of a 
punishment or a reward. Because rational people make decisions by comparing 
costs and benefits, they respond to incentives. You will see that incentives play 
a central role in the study of economics. One economist went so far as to suggest 
that the entire field could be summarized simply: “People respond to incentives. 
The rest is commentary.”
Incentives are crucial to analyzing how markets work. For example, when the 
price of an apple rises, people decide to eat fewer apples. At the same time, apple 
orchards decide to hire more workers and harvest more apples. In other words, 
a higher price in a market provides an incentive for buyers to consume less and 
an incentive for sellers to produce more. As we will see, the influence of prices on 
the behavior of consumers and producers is crucial for how a market economy 
allocates scarce resources.
Public policymakers should never forget about incentives: Many policies change 
the costs or benefits that people face and, therefore, alter their behavior. A tax on 
gasoline, for instance, encourages people to drive smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. 
That is one reason people drive smaller cars in Europe, where gasoline taxes are 
high, than in the United States, where gasoline taxes are low. A gasoline tax also 
encourages people to carpool, take public transportation, and live closer to where 
they work. If the tax were larger, more people would be driving hybrid cars, and 
if it were large enough, they would switch to electric cars.
When policymakers fail to consider how their policies affect incentives, they 
often end up with unintended consequences. For example, consider public policy 
regarding auto safety. Today, all cars have seat belts, but this was not true 50 years 
ago. In the 1960s, Ralph Nader’s book Unsafe at Any Speed generated much public 
concern over auto safety. Congress responded with laws requiring seat belts as 
standard equipment on new cars.
How does a seat belt law affect auto safety? The direct effect is obvious: When 
a person wears a seat belt, the probability of surviving an auto accident rises. But 
that’s not the end of the story because the law also affects behavior by altering 
incentives. The relevant behavior here is the speed and care with which ­drivers 
operate their cars. Driving slowly and carefully is costly because it uses the 
driver’s time and energy. When deciding how safely to drive, rational people com-
pare, perhaps unconsciously, the marginal benefit from safer driving to the mar-
ginal cost. As a result, they drive more slowly and carefully when the benefit of 
increased safety is high. For example, when road conditions are icy, people drive 
more attentively and at lower speeds than they do when road conditions are clear.
Consider how a seat belt law alters a driver’s cost–benefit calculation. Seat belts 
make accidents less costly because they reduce the likelihood of injury or death. 
In other words, seat belts reduce the benefits of slow and careful driving. People 
respond to seat belts as they would to an improvement in road conditions—by 
driving faster and less carefully. The result of a seat belt law, therefore, is a larger 
number of accidents. The decline in safe driving has a clear, adverse impact on 
pedestrians, who are more likely to find themselves in an accident but (unlike the 
drivers) don’t have the benefit of added protection.

Introduction
At first, this discussion of incentives and seat belts might seem like idle specula-
tion. Yet in a classic 1975 study, economist Sam Peltzman argued that auto-­safety 
laws have had many of these effects. According to Peltzman’s evidence, these 
laws produce both fewer deaths per accident and more accidents. He concluded 
that the net result is little change in the number of driver deaths and an increase 
in the number of pedestrian deaths. 
Peltzman’s analysis of auto safety is an offbeat and controversial example of 
the general principle that people respond to incentives. When analyzing any pol-
icy, we must consider not only the direct effects but also the less obvious indirect 
effects that work through incentives. If the policy changes incentives, it will cause 
people to alter their behavior. 
The Incentive Effects of  
Gasoline Prices
From 2005 to 2008 the price of oil in world oil markets skyrocketed, the result of 
limited supplies together with surging demand from robust world growth, espe-
cially in China. The price of gasoline in the United States rose from about $2 to 
about $4 a gallon. At the time, the news was filled with stories about how people 
responded to the increased incentive to conserve, sometimes in obvious ways, 
sometimes in less obvious ways.
	
Here is a sampling of various stories:
• 	 “As Gas Prices Soar, Buyers Are Flocking to Small Cars”
• 	 “As Gas Prices Climb, So Do Scooter Sales”
• 	 “Gas Prices Knock Bicycles Sales, Repairs into Higher Gear”
• 	 “Gas Prices Send Surge of Riders to Mass Transit”
• 	 “Camel Demand Up as Oil Price Soars“: Farmers in the Indian state of 
Rajasthan are rediscovering the humble camel. As the cost of running gas-
guzzling tractors soars, even-toed ungulates are making a comeback.
• 	 “The Airlines Are Suffering, But the Order Books of Boeing and Airbus 
Are Bulging“: Demand for new, more fuel-efficient aircraft has never been 
greater. The latest versions of the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, the single-
aisle workhorses for which demand is strongest, are up to 40% cheaper to 
run than the vintage planes some American airlines still use.
• 	 “Home Buying Practices Adjust to High Gas Prices“: In his hunt for a new 
home, Demetrius Stroud crunched the numbers to find out that, with gas  
prices climbing, moving near an Amtrak station is the best thing for his wallet.
• 	 “Gas Prices Drive Students to Online Courses“: For Christy LaBadie, a sopho-
more at Northampton Community College, the 30-minute drive from her 
home to the Bethlehem, Pa., campus has become a financial hardship now 
that gasoline prices have soared to more than $4 a gallon. So this semester she 
decided to take an online course to save herself the trip­—and the money.
•  “Diddy Halts Private Jet Flights Over Fuel Prices“: Fuel prices have 
grounded an unexpected frequent-flyer: Sean “Diddy” Combs. . . . The 
hip-hop mogul said he is now flying on commercial airlines instead of in 
private jets, which Combs said had previously cost him $200,000 and up for 
a roundtrip between New York and Los Angeles. ”I’m actually flying com-
mercial,“ Diddy said before walking onto an airplane, sitting in a first-class 
seat and flashing his boarding pass to the camera. ”That’s how high gas 
prices are.”

began in 2008 and continued into 2009 reduced the world demand for oil, and the

Where the Buses  
Run on Time
By Austan Goolsbee
O
n a summer afternoon, the drive home 
from the University of Chicago to the 
north side of the city must be one of the 
most beautiful commutes in the world. On 
the left on Lake Shore Drive you pass Grant 
Park, some of the world’s first skyscrapers, 
and the Sears Tower. On the right is the 
intense blue of Lake Michigan. But for all the 
beauty, the traffic can be hell. So, if you drive 
the route every day, you learn the shortcuts. 
You know that if it backs up from the Buck-
ingham Fountain all the way to McCormick 
Place, you’re better off taking the surface 
streets and getting back onto Lake Shore 
Drive a few miles north. 
 
A lot of buses, however, wait in the traf-
fic jams. I have always wondered about that: 
Why don’t the bus drivers use the shortcuts? 
Surely they know about them—they drive 
the same route every day, and they probably 
avoid the traffic when they drive their own 
cars. Buses don’t stop on Lake Shore Drive, 
so they wouldn’t strand anyone by detour-
ing around the congestion. And when buses 
get delayed in heavy traffic, it wreaks havoc 
on the scheduled service. Instead of arriving 
once every 10 minutes, three buses come in 
at the same time after half an hour. That sort 
of bunching is the least efficient way to run 
a public transportation system. So, why not 
take the surface streets if that would keep 
the schedule properly spaced and on time?
 
You might think at first that the problem 
is that the drivers aren’t paid enough to 
strategize. But Chicago bus drivers are the 
seventh-highest paid in the nation; full-timers 
earned more than $23 an hour, according to 
a November 2004 survey. The problem may 
have to do not with how much they are paid, 
but how they are paid. At least, that’s the 
implication of a new study of Chilean bus driv-
ers by Ryan Johnson and David Reiley of the 
University of Arizona and Juan Carlos Muñoz 
of Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. 
 
Companies in Chile pay bus drivers one 
of two ways: either by the hour or by the 
passenger. Paying by the passenger leads 
to significantly shorter delays. Give them 
incentives, and drivers start acting like regu-
lar people do. They take shortcuts when the 
traffic is bad. They take shorter meal breaks 
and bathroom breaks. They want to get on 
the road and pick up more passengers as 
quickly as they can. In short, their productiv-
ity increases….
 
Not everything about incentive pay is 
perfect, of course. When bus drivers start 
moving from place to place more quickly, 
they get in more accidents (just like the rest 
of us). Some passengers also complain that 
the rides make them nauseated because the 
drivers stomp on the gas as soon as the last 
passenger gets on the bus. Yet when given 
the choice, people overwhelmingly choose 
the bus companies that get them where 
they’re going on time. More than 95 percent 
of the routes in Santiago use incentive pay. 
 
Perhaps we should have known that 
incentive pay could increase bus driver pro-
ductivity. After all, the taxis in Chicago take 
the shortcuts on Lake Shore Drive to avoid 
the traffic that buses just sit in. Since taxi 
drivers earn money for every trip they make, 
they want to get you home as quickly as 
possible so they can pick up somebody else.

Introduction
How People Interact
The first four principles discussed how individuals make decisions. As we go 
about our lives, many of our decisions affect not only ourselves but other people 
as well. The next three principles concern how people interact with one another.
Principle 5: Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off
You may have heard on the news that the Japanese are our competitors in the 
world economy. In some ways, this is true because American and Japanese firms 
produce many of the same goods. Ford and Toyota compete for the same ­customers 
in the market for automobiles. Apple and Sony compete for the same ­customers in 
the market for digital music players.
Yet it is easy to be misled when thinking about competition among countries. 
Trade between the United States and Japan is not like a sports contest in which 
one side wins and the other side loses. In fact, the opposite is true: Trade between 
two countries can make each country better off. 
To see why, consider how trade affects your family. When a member of your 
family looks for a job, he or she competes against members of other families who 
are looking for jobs. Families also compete against one another when they go 
shopping because each family wants to buy the best goods at the lowest prices. In 
a sense, each family in the economy is competing with all other families.
Despite this competition, your family would not be better off isolating itself 
from all other families. If it did, your family would need to grow its own food, 
make its own clothes, and build its own home. Clearly, your family gains much 
from its ability to trade with others. Trade allows each person to specialize in the 
activities he or she does best, whether it is farming, sewing, or home building. 
By trading with others, people can buy a greater variety of goods and services at 
lower cost.
Countries as well as families benefit from the ability to trade with one another. 
Trade allows countries to specialize in what they do best and to enjoy a greater 
variety of goods and services. The Japanese, as well as the French and the 
­Egyptians and the Brazilians, are as much our partners in the world economy as 
they are our competitors.
Principle 6: Markets Are Usually a Good Way to 
Organize Economic Activity
The collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in the 1980s 
may be the most important change in the world during the past half century. 
Communist countries worked on the premise that government officials were in 
the best position to allocate the economy’s scarce resources. These central plan-
ners decided what goods and services were produced, how much was produced, 
and who produced and consumed these goods and services. The theory behind 
central planning was that only the government could organize economic activity 
in a way that promoted economic well-being for the country as a whole.
Most countries that once had centrally planned economies have abandoned 
the system and are instead developing market economies. In a market economy, 
the decisions of a central planner are replaced by the decisions of millions of 
firms and households. Firms decide whom to hire and what to make. Households 
decide which firms to work for and what to buy with their incomes. These firms

CHAPTER 1    Ten Principles of Economics
and households interact in the marketplace, where prices and self-interest guide 
their decisions.
At first glance, the success of market economies is puzzling. In a market 
­economy, no one is looking out for the economic well-being of society as a whole. 
Free markets contain many buyers and sellers of numerous goods and services, 
and all of them are interested primarily in their own well-being. Yet despite 
decentralized decision making and self-interested decision makers, market econo-
mies have proven remarkably successful in organizing economic activity to pro-
mote overall economic well-being.
In his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 
economist Adam Smith made the most famous observation in all of econom-
ics: Households and firms interacting in markets act as if they are guided by an 
“invisible hand” that leads them to desirable market outcomes. One of our goals 
in this book is to understand how this invisible hand works its magic. 
As you study economics, you will learn that prices are the instrument with 
which the invisible hand directs economic activity. In any market, buyers look at 
the price when determining how much to demand, and sellers look at the price 
when deciding how much to supply. As a result of the decisions that buyers and 
sellers make, market prices reflect both the value of a good to society and the 
cost to society of making the good. Smith’s great insight was that prices adjust to 
guide these individual buyers and sellers to reach outcomes that, in many cases, 
maximize the well-being of society as a whole.
Smith’s insight has an important corollary: When the government prevents 
prices from adjusting naturally to supply and demand, it impedes the invisible 
hand’s ability to coordinate the decisions of the households and firms that make 
up the economy. This corollary explains why taxes adversely affect the alloca-
tion of resources, for they distort prices and thus the decisions of households 
and firms. It also explains the great harm caused by policies that directly control 
prices, such as rent control. And it explains the failure of communism. In com-
munist countries, prices were not determined in the marketplace but were dic-
tated by central planners. These planners lacked the necessary information about 
­consumers’ tastes and producers’ costs, which in a market economy is reflected 
in prices. Central planners failed because they tried to run the economy with one 
hand tied behind their backs—the invisible hand of the marketplace.
Principle 7: Governments Can Sometimes  
Improve Market Outcomes
 If the invisible hand of the market is so great, why do we need government? One 
purpose of studying economics is to refine your view about the proper role and 
scope of government policy.
One reason we need government is that the invisible hand can work its magic 
only if the government enforces the rules and maintains the institutions that are 
key to a market economy. Most important, market economies need institutions 
to enforce property rights so individuals can own and control scarce resources. 
A farmer won’t grow food if he expects his crop to be stolen; a restaurant won’t 
serve meals unless it is assured that customers will pay before they leave; and an 
entertainment company won’t produce DVDs if too many potential ­customers 
avoid paying by making illegal copies. We all rely on government-provided 
police and courts to enforce our rights over the things we produce—and the invis-
ible hand counts on our ability to enforce our rights.

Introduction
Yet there is another reason we need government: The invisible hand is powerful, 
but it is not omnipotent. There are two broad reasons for a government to intervene 
in the economy and change the allocation of resources that people would choose 
on their own: to promote efficiency or to promote equality. That is, most policies 
aim either to enlarge the economic pie or to change how the pie is divided.
Consider first the goal of efficiency. Although the invisible hand usually leads 
markets to allocate resources to maximize the size of the economic pie, this is not 
always the case. Economists use the term market failure to refer to a situation in 
which the market on its own fails to produce an efficient allocation of resources. 
As we will see, one possible cause of market failure is an externality, which is 
the impact of one person’s actions on the well-being of a bystander. The classic

market left on its own

FYI
 Adam Smith and the Invisible Hand
I
t may be only a coincidence that Adam Smith’s great book The 
Wealth of Nations was published in 1776, the exact year Ameri-
can revolutionaries signed the Declaration of Independence. But 
the two documents share a point of view that was prevalent at the 
time: Individuals are usually best left to their own devices, without 
the heavy hand of government guiding their actions. This political 
philosophy provides the intellectual basis for the market economy 
and for free society more generally. 
 
Why do decentralized market economies work so well? Is it 
because people can be counted on to treat one another with love 
and kindness? Not at all. Here is Adam Smith’s description of how 
people interact in a market economy:
Man has almost constant occasion for the 
help of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to 
expect it from their benevolence only. He will 
be more likely to prevail if he can interest their 
self-love in his favour, and show them that it 
is for their own advantage to do for him what 
he requires of them. . . . Give me that which I 
want, and you shall have this which you want, 
is the meaning of every such offer; and it is in 
this manner that we obtain from one another 
the far greater part of those good offices 
which we stand in need of. 
It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, 
or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard 
to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their 
humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of 
our own necessities but of their advantages. Nobody but a 
beggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of 
his fellow-citizens. . . . 
Every individual . . . neither intends to promote the public 
interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. . . . He 
intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other 
cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was 
no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the 
society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he 
frequently promotes that of the society more effec-
tually than when he really intends to promote it.
Smith is saying that participants in the economy 
are motivated by self-interest and that the “invisible 
hand” of the marketplace guides this self-interest 
into promoting general economic well-being.
 
Many of Smith’s insights remain at the center of 
modern economics. Our analysis in the coming chap-
ters will allow us to express Smith’s conclusions more 
precisely and to analyze more fully the strengths and 
weaknesses of the market’s invisible hand.

example of an externality is pollution. Another possible cause of market failure 
is market power, which refers to the ability of a single person (or small group) 
to unduly influence market prices. For example, if everyone in town needs water 
but there is only one well, the owner of the well is not subject to the rigorous 
competition with which the invisible hand normally keeps self-interest in check. 
In the presence of externalities or market power, well-designed public policy can 
enhance economic efficiency.
Now consider the goal of equality. Even when the invisible hand is yielding 
efficient outcomes, it can nonetheless leave sizable disparities in economic well-
being. A market economy rewards people according to their ability to produce 
things that other people are willing to pay for. The world’s best basketball 
player earns more than the world’s best chess player simply because people are 
willing to pay more to watch basketball than chess. The invisible hand does not 
ensure that everyone has sufficient food, decent clothing, and adequate health-
care. This inequality may, depending on one’s political philosophy, call for gov-
ernment intervention. In practice, many public policies, such as the income tax 
and the welfare system, aim to achieve a more equal distribution of economic 
well-being.
To say that the government can improve on market outcomes at times does 
not mean that it always will. Public policy is made not by angels but by a political 
process that is far from perfect. Sometimes policies are designed simply to reward 
the politically powerful. Sometimes they are made by well-intentioned leaders 
who are not fully informed. As you study economics, you will become a better 
judge of when a government policy is justifiable because it promotes efficiency or 
equality and when it is not.

How the Economy as a Whole Works
We started by discussing how individuals make decisions and then looked at how 
people interact with one another. All these decisions and interactions together 
make up “the economy.” The last three principles concern the workings of the 
economy as a whole.
Principle 8: A Country’s Standard of Living Depends 
on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services
The differences in living standards around the world are staggering. In 2008, the 
average American had an income of about $47,000. In the same year, the average 
Mexican earned about $10,000, and the average Nigerian earned only $1,400. Not 
surprisingly, this large variation in average income is reflected in various mea-
sures of the quality of life. Citizens of high-income countries have more TV sets, 
more cars, better nutrition, better healthcare, and a longer life expectancy than 
citizens of low-income countries.
	
Changes in living standards over time are also large. In the United States, 
incomes have historically grown about 2 percent per year (after adjusting for

Introduction
changes in the cost of living). At this rate, average income doubles every 35 years. 
Over the past century, average U.S. income has risen about eightfold. 
What explains these large differences in living standards among countries and 
over time? The answer is surprisingly simple. Almost all variation in living stan-
dards is attributable to differences in countries’ productivity—that is, the amount 
of goods and services produced from each unit of labor input. In nations where 
workers can produce a large quantity of goods and services per unit of time, most 
people enjoy a high standard of living; in nations where workers are less produc-
tive, most people endure a more meager existence. Similarly, the growth rate of a 
nation’s productivity determines the growth rate of its average income.
The fundamental relationship between productivity and living standards is 
simple, but its implications are far-reaching. If productivity is the primary deter-
minant of living standards, other explanations must be of secondary importance. 
For example, it might be tempting to credit labor unions or minimum-wage laws 
for the rise in living standards of American workers over the past century. Yet the 
real hero of American workers is their rising productivity. As another example, 
some commentators have claimed that increased competition from Japan and 
other countries explained the slow growth in U.S. incomes during the 1970s and 
1980s. Yet the real villain was not competition from abroad but flagging produc-
tivity growth in the United States.
The relationship between productivity and living standards also has profound 
implications for public policy. When thinking about how any policy will affect liv-
ing standards, the key question is how it will affect our ability to produce goods 
and services. To boost living standards, policymakers need to raise productivity 
by ensuring that workers are well educated, have the tools needed to produce 
goods and services, and have access to the best available technology.

M
y take on training in economics is that 
it becomes increasingly valuable as 
you move up the career ladder. I can’t imag-
ine a better major for corporate CEOs, con-
gressmen, or American presidents. You’ve 
learned a systematic, disciplined way of 
thinking that will serve you well. By contrast, 
the economically challenged must be per-
plexed about how it is that economies work 
better the fewer people they have in charge. 
Who does the planning? Who makes deci-
sions? Who decides what to produce? 
 
For my money, Adam Smith’s invisible 
hand is the most important thing you’ve 
learned by studying economics. You under-
stand how we can each work for our own 
self-interest and still produce a desirable 
social outcome. You know how uncoordi-
nated activity gets coordinated by the market 
to enhance the wealth of nations. You under-
stand the magic of markets and the dangers 
of tampering with them too much. You know 
better what you first learned in kindergarten: 
that you shouldn’t kill or cripple the goose 
that lays the golden eggs. . . .
 
Economics training will help you under-
stand fallacies and unintended ­consequences.

CHAPTER 1    Ten Principles of Economics
“Well it may have 
been 68 cents when 
you got in line, but 
it’s 74 cents now!”
Source: The Wall Street Journal, June 4, 2003.
In fact, I am inclined to define economics as 
the study of how to anticipate unintended 
consequences. . . . 
 
Little in the literature seems more rele­
vant to contemporary economic debates 
than what usually is called the broken 
window fallacy. Whenever a government 
program is justified not on its merits but by 
the jobs it will create, remember the broken 
window: Some teenagers, being the little 
beasts that they are, toss a brick through 
a bakery window. A crowd gathers and 
laments, “What a shame.” But before you 
know it, someone suggests a silver lining to 
the situation: Now the baker will have to 
spend money to have the window repaired. 
This will add to the income of the repair-
man, who will spend his additional income, 
which will add to another seller’s income, 
and so on. You know the drill. The chain of 
spending will multiply and generate higher 
income and employment. If the broken 
window is large enough, it might produce 
an economic boom! . . .
 
Most voters fall for the broken window 
fallacy, but not economics majors. They will 
say, “Hey, wait a minute!” If the baker 
hadn’t spent his money on window repair, 
he would have spent it on the new suit he 
was saving to buy. Then the tailor would 
have the new income to spend, and so on. 
The broken window didn’t create net new 
spending; it just diverted spending from 
somewhere else. The broken window does 
not create new activity, just different activ-
ity. People see the activity that takes place. 
They don’t see the activity that would have 
taken place.
 
The broken window fallacy is perpetu-
ated in many forms. Whenever job ­creation 
or retention is the primary objective I call 
it the job-counting fallacy. Economics 
majors understand the non-intuitive real-
ity that real progress comes from job 
destruction. It once took 90 percent of 
our population to grow our food. Now it 
takes 3 percent. Pardon me, Willie, but are 
we worse off because of the job losses in 
agriculture? The would-have-been farmers 
are now college professors and computer 
gurus. . . .
 
So instead of counting jobs, we 
should make every job count. We will 
occasionally hit a soft spot when we 
have a mismatch of supply and demand 
in the labor market. But that is tempo-
rary. Don’t become a Luddite and destroy 
the machinery, or become a protectionist 
and try to grow bananas in New York 
City.
Principle 9: Prices Rise When the Government  
Prints Too Much Money
In January 1921, a daily newspaper in Germany cost 0.30 marks. Less than two 
years later, in November 1922, the same newspaper cost 70,000,000 marks. All 
other prices in the economy rose by similar amounts. This episode is one of his-
tory’s most spectacular examples of inflation, an increase in the overall level of 
prices in the economy.
Although the United States has never experienced inflation even close to 
that of Germany in the 1920s, inflation has at times been an economic prob-
lem. During the 1970s, for instance, when the overall level of prices more 
than doubled, President Gerald Ford called inflation “public enemy number 
one.” By contrast, inflation in the first decade of the 21st century has run 
about 2½ percent per year; at this rate, it would take almost 30 years for 
prices to double. Because high inflation imposes various costs on society, 
keeping inflation at a low level is a goal of economic policymakers around 
the world.
What causes inflation? In almost all cases of large or persistent inflation, the 
culprit is growth in the quantity of money. When a government creates large 
quantities of the nation’s money, the value of the money falls. In Germany in 
the early 1920s, when prices were on average tripling every month, the quantity 
of money was also tripling every month. Although less dramatic, the economic 
history of the United States points to a similar conclusion: The high inflation of 
the 1970s was associated with rapid growth in the quantity of money, and the 
low inflation of more recent experience was associated with slow growth in the 
quantity of money.

Introduction
Principle 10: Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-off 
between Inflation and Unemployment
Although a higher level of prices is, in the long run, the primary effect of 
increasing the quantity of money, the short-run story is more complex and con-
troversial. Most economists describe the short-run effects of monetary injections 
as follows: 
• 	 Increasing the amount of money in the economy stimulates the overall level 
of spending and thus the demand for goods and services. 
• 	 Higher demand may over time cause firms to raise their prices, but in the 
meantime, it also encourages them to hire more workers and produce a 
larger quantity of goods and services. 
• 	 More hiring means lower unemployment. 
This line of reasoning leads to one final economy-wide trade-off: a short-run 
trade-off between inflation and unemployment.
Although some economists still question these ideas, most accept that society 
faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. This simply 
means that, over a period of a year or two, many economic policies push infla-
tion and unemployment in opposite directions. Policymakers face this trade-off 
regardless of whether inflation and unemployment both start out at high levels (as 
they did in the early 1980s), at low levels (as they did in the late 1990s), or some-
place in between. This short-run trade-off plays a key role in the analysis of the 
business cycle—the irregular and largely unpredictable fluctuations in economic 
activity, as measured by the production of goods and services or the number of 
people employed.
Policymakers can exploit the short-run trade-off between inflation and 
unemployment using various policy instruments. By changing the amount 
that the government spends, the amount it taxes, and the amount of money 
it prints, policymakers can influence the overall demand for goods and ser-
vices. Changes in demand in turn influence the combination of inflation and 
unemployment that the economy experiences in the short run. Because these 
instruments of economic policy are potentially so powerful, how policymakers 
should use these instruments to control the economy, if at all, is a subject of 
continuing debate.
This debate heated up in the early years of Barack Obama’s presidency.  In 2008 
and 2009, the U.S. economy, as well as many other economies around the world, 
experienced a deep economic downturn. Problems in the financial system, caused 
by bad bets on the housing market, spilled over into the rest of the economy, 
causing incomes to fall and unemployment to soar. Policymakers responded in 
various ways to increase the overall demand for goods and services. President 
Obama’s first major initiative was a stimulus package of reduced taxes and 
increased government spending. At the same time, the nation’s central bank, the 
Federal Reserve, increased the supply of money. The goal of these policies was to 
reduce unemployment. Some feared, however, that these policies might over time 
lead to an excessive level of inflation.

CHAPTER 1    Ten Principles of Economics
Conclusion
You now have a taste of what economics is all about. In the coming chapters, we 
develop many specific insights about people, markets, and economies. Mastering 
these insights will take some effort, but it is not an overwhelming task. The field of 
economics is based on a few big ideas that can be applied in many different situations.
Throughout this book, we will refer back to the Ten Principles of Economics high-
lighted in this chapter and summarized in Table 1. Keep these building blocks 
in mind: Even the most sophisticated economic analysis is founded on the ten 
principles introduced here. 
FYI
 How to Read This Book
E
conomics is fun, but it can also be hard to learn. My aim in writ-
ing this text is to make it as enjoyable and easy as possible. But 
you, the student, also have a role to play. Experience shows that if 
you are actively involved as you study this book, you will enjoy a 
better outcome both on your exams and in the years that follow. 
Here are a few tips about how best to read this book.
1. Read before class. Students do better when they read the 
relevant textbook chapter before attending a lecture. You will 
understand the lecture better, and your questions will be better 
focused on where you need extra help.
2. Summarize, don’t highlight. Running a yellow marker over 
the text is too passive an activity to keep your mind engaged. 
Instead, when you come to the end of a section, take a minute 
and summarize what you just learned in your own words, writing 
your summary in the wide margins we’ve provided. When you’ve 
finished the chapter, compare your summaries with the one at 
the end of the chapter. Did you pick up the main points? 
3. Test yourself. Throughout the book, Quick Quizzes offer instant 
feedback to find out if you’ve learned what you are supposed to. 
Take the opportunity to write down your answer, and then check 
it against the answers provided at this book’s website. The quiz-
zes are meant to test your basic comprehension. If your answer 
is incorrect, you probably need to review the section.
4. Practice, practice, practice. At the end of each chapter, Ques-
tions for Review test your understanding, and Problems and 
Applications ask you to apply and extend the material. Perhaps 
your instructor will assign some of these exercises as homework. 
If so, do them. If not, do them anyway. The more you use your 
new knowledge, the more solid it becomes.
5. Go online. The publisher of this book maintains an extensive 
website to help you in your study of economics. It includes 
additional examples, applications, and problems, as well as quiz-
zes so you can test yourself. Check it out. The website is www
.cengage.com/economics/mankiw.
6. Study in groups. After you’ve read the book and worked prob-
lems on your own, get together with classmates to discuss the 
material. You will learn from each other—an example of the 
gains from trade. 
7. Teach someone. As all teachers know, there is no better way 
to learn something than to teach it to someone else. Take the 
opportunity to teach new economic concepts to a study partner, 
a friend, a parent, or even a pet.
8. Don’t skip the real-world examples. In the midst of all the num-
bers, graphs, and strange new words, it is easy to lose sight of 
what economics is all about. The Case Studies and In the News 
boxes sprinkled throughout this book should help remind you. 
They show how the theory is tied to events happening in all our 
lives.
9. Apply economic thinking to your daily life. Once you’ve read 
about how others apply economics to the real world, try it 
yourself! You can use economic analysis to better understand 
your own decisions, the economy around you, and the events 
you read about in the newspaper. The world may never look the 
same again.

	 4.	 You win $100 in a basketball pool. You have 
a choice between spending the money now or 
putting it away for a year in a bank account 
that pays 5 percent interest. What is the oppor-
tunity cost of spending the $100 now?
	 5.	 The company that you manage has invested  
$5 million in developing a new product, but the 
development is not quite finished. At a recent 
meeting, your salespeople report that the intro-
duction of competing products has reduced  
the expected sales of your new product to  
$3 million. If it would cost $1 million to finish 
development and make the product, should 
you go ahead and do so? What is the most that 
you should pay to complete development?
	 6.	 The Social Security system provides income for 
people over age 65. If a recipient of Social  
Security decides to work and earn some 
income, the amount he or she receives in Social 
Security benefits is typically reduced.
a.	 How does the provision of Social Security  
affect people’s incentive to save while 
­working?
b.	How does the reduction in benefits associ-
ated with higher earnings affect people’s 
incentive to work past age 65?
	 7.	 A 1996 bill reforming the federal government’s 
antipoverty programs limited many welfare 
recipients to only two years of benefits.
a.	 How does this change affect the incentives 
for working?
b.	How might this change represent a trade-off 
between equality and efficiency?
	 8.	 Your roommate is a better cook than you are, 
but you can clean more quickly than your 
roommate can. If your roommate did all the 
cooking and you did all the cleaning, would 
your chores take you more or less time than if 
you divided each task evenly? Give a similar 
example of how specialization and trade can 
make two countries both better off.
	 9.	 Explain whether each of the following govern-
ment activities is motivated by a concern about 
equality or a concern about efficiency. In the 
case of efficiency, discuss the type of market 
failure involved.
a.	 regulating cable TV prices
b.	providing some poor people with vouchers 
that can be used to buy food
c.	 prohibiting smoking in public places
d.	breaking up Standard Oil (which once 
owned 90 percent of all oil refineries) into 
several smaller companies
e.	 imposing higher personal income tax rates 
on people with higher incomes
f.	 instituting laws against driving while 
­intoxicated

PART I	
Introduction
	10.	 Discuss each of the following statements from 
the standpoints of equality and efficiency.
a.	 “Everyone in society should be guaranteed 
the best healthcare possible.” 
b.	“When workers are laid off, they should be 
able to collect unemployment benefits until 
they find a new job.”
	11.	 In what ways is your standard of living differ-
ent from that of your parents or grandparents 
when they were your age? Why have these 
changes occurred?
	12.	 Suppose Americans decide to save more of 
their incomes. If banks lend this extra saving to 
businesses, which use the funds to build new 
factories, how might this lead to faster growth 
in productivity? Who do you suppose benefits 
from the higher productivity? Is society getting 
a free lunch?
	13.	 In 2010, President Barack Obama and Congress 
enacted a healthcare reform bill in the United 
States. Two goals of the bill were to provide 
more Americans with health insurance (via sub-
sidies for lower-income households financed 
by taxes on higher-income households) and 
to reduce the cost of healthcare (via various 
reforms in how healthcare is provided).  
a.	 How do these goals relate to equality and 
efficiency?
b.	How might healthcare reform increase pro-
ductivity in the United States?  
c.	 How might healthcare reform decrease pro-
ductivity in the United States?
	14.	 During the Revolutionary War, the American 
colonies could not raise enough tax revenue 
to fully fund the war effort; to make up this 
difference, the colonies decided to print more 
money. Printing money to cover expenditures 
is sometimes referred to as an “inflation tax.” 
Who do you think is being “taxed” when more 
money is printed? Why?
	15.	 Imagine that you are a policymaker trying to 
decide whether to reduce the rate of inflation. 
To make an intelligent decision, what would 
you need to know about inflation, unemploy-
ment, and the trade-off between them?
	16.	 A policymaker is deciding how to finance the 
construction of a new airport.  He can either 
pay for it by increasing citizens’ taxes or by 
printing more money. What are some of the 
short-run and long-run consequences of each 
option?
