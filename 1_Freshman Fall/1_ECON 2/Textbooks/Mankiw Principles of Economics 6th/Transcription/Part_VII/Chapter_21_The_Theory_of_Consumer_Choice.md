The Theory of     
    Consumer Choice
W
hen you walk into a store, you are confronted with thousands of 
goods that you might buy. Because your financial resources are lim-
ited, however, you cannot buy everything that you want. You there-
fore consider the prices of the various goods offered for sale and buy 
a bundle of goods that, given your resources, best suits your needs and desires.
In this chapter, we develop a theory that describes how consumers make deci-
sions about what to buy. Thus far in this book, we have summarized consumers’ 
decisions with the demand curve. As we have seen, the demand curve for a good 
reflects consumers’ willingness to pay for it. When the price of a good rises, con-
sumers are willing to pay for fewer units, so the quantity demanded falls. We now 
look more deeply at the decisions that lie behind the demand curve. The theory of 
consumer choice presented in this chapter provides a more complete understand-
ing of demand, just as the theory of the competitive firm in Chapter 14 provides 
a more complete understanding of supply.

One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that people face 
trade-offs. The theory of consumer choice examines the trade-offs that people 
face in their role as consumers. When a consumer buys more of one good, he can 
afford less of other goods. When he spends more time enjoying leisure and less 
time working, he has lower income and can afford less consumption. When he 
spends more of his income in the present and saves less of it, he must accept a 
lower level of consumption in the future. The theory of consumer choice examines 
how consumers facing these trade-offs make decisions and how they respond to 
changes in their environment.
After developing the basic theory of consumer choice, we apply it to three 
questions about household decisions. In particular, we ask:
• 	 Do all demand curves slope downward?
• 	 How do wages affect labor supply?
• 	 How do interest rates affect household saving?
At first, these questions might seem unrelated. But as we will see, we can use the 
theory of consumer choice to address each of them. 
The Budget Constraint: What the Consumer Can Afford
Most people would like to increase the quantity or quality of the goods they 
consume—to take longer vacations, drive fancier cars, or eat at better restaurants. 
People consume less than they desire because their spending is constrained, or 
limited, by their income. We begin our study of consumer choice by examining 
this link between income and spending.
To keep things simple, we examine the decision facing a consumer who buys 
only two goods: pizza and Pepsi. Of course, real people buy thousands of dif-
ferent kinds of goods. Assuming there are only two goods greatly simplifies the 
problem without altering the basic insights about consumer choice.
We first consider how the consumer’s income constrains the amount he spends 
on pizza and Pepsi. Suppose the consumer has an income of $1,000 per month and 
he spends his entire income on pizza and Pepsi. The price of a pizza is $10, and 
the price of a pint of Pepsi is $2. 
The table in Figure 1 shows some of the many combinations of pizza and Pepsi 
that the consumer can buy. The first row in the table shows that if the consumer 
spends all his income on pizza, he can eat 100 pizzas during the month, but he 
would not be able to buy any Pepsi at all. The second row shows another possible 
consumption bundle: 90 pizzas and 50 pints of Pepsi. And so on. Each consump-
tion bundle in the table costs exactly $1,000.
The graph in Figure 1 illustrates the consumption bundles that the consumer 
can choose. The vertical axis measures the number of pints of Pepsi, and the 
horizontal axis measures the number of pizzas. Three points are marked on this 
figure. At point A, the consumer buys no Pepsi and consumes 100 pizzas. At point 
B, the consumer buys no pizza and consumes 500 pints of Pepsi. At point C, the 
consumer buys 50 pizzas and 250 pints of Pepsi. Point C, which is exactly at the 
middle of the line from A to B, is the point at which the consumer spends an equal 
amount ($500) on pizza and Pepsi. These are only three of the many combinations 
of pizza and Pepsi that the consumer can choose. All the points on the line from A 
to B are possible. This line, called the budget constraint, shows the consumption

budget constraint
The budget constraint shows the various bundles of goods that the consumer can 
buy for a given income. Here the consumer buys bundles of pizza and Pepsi. The 
table and graph show what the consumer can afford if his income is $1,000, the 
price of pizza is $10, and the price of Pepsi is $2.
bundles that the consumer can afford. In this case, it shows the trade-off between 
pizza and Pepsi that the consumer faces.
The slope of the budget constraint measures the rate at which the consumer can 
trade one good for the other. Recall that the slope between two points is calculated 
as the change in the vertical distance divided by the change in the horizontal dis-
tance (“rise over run”). From point A to point B, the vertical distance is 500 pints, 
and the horizontal distance is 100 pizzas. Thus, the slope is 5 pints per pizza. 
(Actually, because the budget constraint slopes downward, the slope is a negative 
number. But for our purposes, we can ignore the minus sign.)
Notice that the slope of the budget constraint equals the relative price of the two 
goods—the price of one good compared to the price of the other. A pizza costs five 
times as much as a pint of Pepsi, so the opportunity cost of a pizza is 5 pints of 
Pepsi. The budget constraint’s slope of 5 reflects the trade-off the market is offer-
ing the consumer: 1 pizza for 5 pints of Pepsi.
Quick Quiz  Draw the budget constraint for a person with income of $1,000 if 
the price of Pepsi is $5 and the price of pizza is $10. What is the slope of this budget 
constraint?
Preferences: What the Consumer Wants
Our goal in this chapter is to see how consumers make choices. The budget 
constraint is one piece of the analysis: It shows the combinations of goods the 
­consumer can afford given his income and the prices of the goods. The ­consumer’s

choices, however, depend not only on his budget constraint but also on his prefer-
ences regarding the two goods. Therefore, the consumer’s preferences are the next 
piece of our analysis. 
Representing Preferences with Indifference Curves
The consumer’s preferences allow him to choose among different bundles of pizza 
and Pepsi. If you offer the consumer two different bundles, he chooses the bundle 
that best suits his tastes. If the two bundles suit his tastes equally well, we say that 
the consumer is indifferent between the two bundles. 
Just as we have represented the consumer’s budget constraint graphically, 
we can also represent his preferences graphically. We do this with indifference 
curves. An indifference curve shows the various bundles of consumption that 
make the consumer equally happy. In this case, the indifference curves show the 
combinations of pizza and Pepsi with which the consumer is equally satisfied. 
Figure 2 shows two of the consumer’s many indifference curves. The consumer 
is indifferent among combinations A, B, and C because they are all on the same 
curve. Not surprisingly, if the consumer’s consumption of pizza is reduced, say, 
from point A to point B, consumption of Pepsi must increase to keep him equally 
happy. If consumption of pizza is reduced again, from point B to point C, the 
amount of Pepsi consumed must increase yet again.
The slope at any point on an indifference curve equals the rate at which the 
consumer is willing to substitute one good for the other. This rate is called the 
marginal rate of substitution (MRS). In this case, the marginal rate of substitution 
measures how much Pepsi the consumer requires to be compensated for a one-
unit reduction in pizza consumption. Notice that because the indifference curves 
are not straight lines, the marginal rate of substitution is not the same at all points 
on a given indifference curve. The rate at which a consumer is willing to trade one 
good for the other depends on the amounts of the goods he is already consuming. 
That is, the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade pizza for Pepsi depends 
on whether he is hungrier or thirstier, which in turn depends on how much pizza 
and Pepsi he is consuming.
The consumer is equally happy at all points on any given indifference curve, 
but he prefers some indifference curves to others. Because he prefers more

The Consumer’s Preferences
The consumer’s preferences are represented with 
indifference curves, which show the combinations 
of pizza and Pepsi that make the consumer equally 
satisfied. Because the consumer prefers more of a 
good, points on a higher indifference curve (I2 here) 
are preferred to points on a lower indifference curve 
(I1). The marginal rate of substitution (MRS) shows the 
rate at which the consumer is willing to trade Pepsi for 
pizza. It measures the quantity of Pepsi the consumer 
must be given in exchange for 1 pizza.

CHAPTER 21    The Theory of Consumer Choice
­consumption to less, higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones. In 
Figure 2, any point on curve I2 is preferred to any point on curve I1.
A consumer’s set of indifference curves gives a complete ranking of the con-
sumer’s preferences. That is, we can use the indifference curves to rank any two 
bundles of goods. For example, the indifference curves tell us that point D is pre-
ferred to point A because point D is on a higher indifference curve than point A. 
(That conclusion may be obvious, however, because point D offers the consumer 
both more pizza and more Pepsi.) The indifference curves also tell us that point 
D is preferred to point C because point D is on a higher indifference curve. Even 
though point D has less Pepsi than point C, it has more than enough extra pizza 
to make the consumer prefer it. By seeing which point is on the higher indiffer-
ence curve, we can use the set of indifference curves to rank any combination of 
pizza and Pepsi.
Four Properties of Indifference Curves
Because indifference curves represent a consumer’s preferences, they have certain 
properties that reflect those preferences. Here we consider four properties that 
describe most indifference curves:
• 	 Property 1: Higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones. People usually 
prefer to consume more goods rather than less. This preference for greater 
quantities is reflected in the indifference curves. As Figure 2 shows, higher 
indifference curves represent larger quantities of goods than lower indiffer-
ence curves. Thus, the consumer prefers being on higher indifference curves. 
• 	 Property 2: Indifference curves are downward sloping. The slope of an indif-
ference curve reflects the rate at which the consumer is willing to substi-
tute one good for the other. In most cases, the consumer likes both goods. 
Therefore, if the quantity of one good is reduced, the quantity of the other 
good must increase for the consumer to be equally happy. For this reason, 
most indifference curves slope downward.
• 	 Property 3: Indifference curves do not cross. To see why this is true, suppose 
that two indifference curves did cross, as in Figure 3. Then, because point 
A is on the same indifference curve as point B, the two points would make 
Figure 3
The Impossibility of Intersecting 
Indifference Curves
A situation like this can never happen. 
According to these indifference 
curves, the consumer would be equally 
satisfied at points A, B, and C, even 
though point C has more of both goods 
than point A.

the consumer equally happy. In addition, because point B is on the same 
indifference curve as point C, these two points would make the consumer 
equally happy. But these conclusions imply that points A and C would also 
make the consumer equally happy, even though point C has more of both 
goods. This contradicts our assumption that the consumer always prefers 
more of both goods to less. Thus, indifference curves cannot cross.
• 	 Property 4: Indifference curves are bowed inward. The slope of an indifference 
curve is the marginal rate of substitution—the rate at which the consumer 
is willing to trade off one good for the other. The marginal rate of substitu-
tion (MRS) usually depends on the amount of each good the consumer is 
currently consuming. In particular, because people are more willing to trade 
away goods that they have in abundance and less willing to trade away 
goods of which they have little, the indifference curves are bowed inward. 
As an example, consider Figure 4. At point A, because the consumer has a 
lot of Pepsi and only a little pizza, he is very hungry but not very thirsty. To 
induce the consumer to give up 1 pizza, he has to be given 6 pints of Pepsi: 
The marginal rate of substitution is 6 pints per pizza. By contrast, at point B, 
the consumer has little Pepsi and a lot of pizza, so he is very thirsty but not 
very hungry. At this point, he would be willing to give up 1 pizza to get 1 
pint of Pepsi: The marginal rate of substitution is 1 pint per pizza. Thus, the 
bowed shape of the indifference curve reflects the consumer’s greater will-
ingness to give up a good that he already has in large quantity.
Two Extreme Examples of Indifference Curves
The shape of an indifference curve tells us about the consumer’s willingness to 
trade one good for the other. When the goods are easy to substitute for each other, 
the indifference curves are less bowed; when the goods are hard to substitute, 
the indifference curves are very bowed. To see why this is true, let’s consider the 
extreme cases.
Figure 4
Bowed Indifference Curves
Indifference curves are usually bowed 
inward. This shape implies that the 
marginal rate of substitution (MRS) 
depends on the quantity of the two 
goods the consumer is consuming. At 
point A, the consumer has little pizza 
and much Pepsi, so he requires a lot of 
extra Pepsi to induce him to give up 
one of the pizzas: The marginal rate of 
substitution is 6 pints of Pepsi per pizza. 
At point B, the consumer has much 
pizza and little Pepsi, so he requires 
only a little extra Pepsi to induce him to 
give up one of the pizzas: The marginal 
rate of substitution is 1 pint of Pepsi per 
pizza.

CHAPTER 21    The Theory of Consumer Choice
Perfect Substitutes  Suppose that someone offered you bundles of nickels 
and dimes. How would you rank the different bundles?
Most likely, you would care only about the total monetary value of each bundle. 
If so, you would always be willing to trade 2 nickels for 1 dime, regardless of the 
number of nickels and dimes in the bundle. Your marginal rate of substitution 
between nickels and dimes would be a fixed number—2. 
We can represent your preferences over nickels and dimes with the indiffer-
ence curves in panel (a) of Figure 5. Because the marginal rate of substitution is 
constant, the indifference curves are straight lines. In this extreme case of straight 
indifference curves, we say that the two goods are perfect substitutes.
Perfect Complements  Suppose now that someone offered you bundles of 
shoes. Some of the shoes fit your left foot, others your right foot. How would you 
rank these different bundles?
In this case, you might care only about the number of pairs of shoes. In other 
words, you would judge a bundle based on the number of pairs you could assem-
ble from it. A bundle of 5 left shoes and 7 right shoes yields only 5 pairs. Getting 
1 more right shoe has no value if there is no left shoe to go with it. 
We can represent your preferences for right and left shoes with the indifference 
curves in panel (b) of Figure 5. In this case, a bundle with 5 left shoes and 5 right 
shoes is just as good as a bundle with 5 left shoes and 7 right shoes. It is also just 
as good as a bundle with 7 left shoes and 5 right shoes. The indifference curves, 
therefore, are right angles. In this extreme case of right-angle indifference curves, 
we say that the two goods are perfect complements.
In the real world, of course, most goods are neither perfect substitutes (like 
nickels and dimes) nor perfect complements (like right shoes and left shoes). 
More typically, the indifference curves are bowed inward, but not so bowed as to 
become right angles.

When two goods are easily substitutable, such as nickels and dimes, the indifference

Quick Quiz  Draw some indifference curves for pizza and Pepsi. Explain the four 
properties of these indifference curves.
Optimization: What the Consumer Chooses
The goal of this chapter is to understand how a consumer makes choices. We have 
the two pieces necessary for this analysis: the consumer’s budget constraint (how 
much he can afford to spend) and the consumer’s preferences (what he wants to 
spend it on). Now we put these two pieces together and consider the consumer’s 
decision about what to buy. 
The Consumer’s Optimal Choices
Consider once again our pizza and Pepsi example. The consumer would like to 
end up with the best possible combination of pizza and Pepsi for him—that is, the 
combination on his highest possible indifference curve. But the consumer must 
also end up on or below his budget constraint, which measures the total resources 
available to him.
Figure 6 shows the consumer’s budget constraint and three of his many indif-
ference curves. The highest indifference curve that the consumer can reach (I2 in 
the figure) is the one that just barely touches his budget constraint. The point at 
which this indifference curve and the budget constraint touch is called the opti-
mum. The consumer would prefer point A, but he cannot afford that point because 
it lies above his budget constraint. The consumer can afford point B, but that point 
is on a lower indifference curve and, therefore, provides the consumer less satis-
faction. The optimum represents the best combination of pizza and Pepsi available 
to the consumer.
Notice that, at the optimum, the slope of the indifference curve equals the 
slope of the budget constraint. We say that the indifference curve is tangent to 
the budget constraint. The slope of the indifference curve is the marginal rate of 
substitution between pizza and Pepsi, and the slope of the budget constraint is the 
Figure 6
The Consumer’s Optimum
The consumer chooses the point on his 
budget constraint that lies on the highest 
indifference curve. At this point, called the 
optimum, the marginal rate of substitution 
equals the relative price of the two goods. 
Here the highest indifference curve the 
consumer can reach is I2. The consumer prefers 
point A, which lies on indifference curve I3, 
but the consumer cannot afford this bundle 
of pizza and Pepsi. By contrast, point B  
is affordable, but because it lies on a lower 
indifference curve, the consumer does not 
prefer it.

CHAPTER 21    The Theory of Consumer Choice
relative price of pizza and Pepsi. Thus, the consumer chooses consumption of the two 
goods so that the marginal rate of substitution equals the relative price.
In Chapter 7, we saw how market prices reflect the marginal value that con-
sumers place on goods. This analysis of consumer choice shows the same result in 
another way. In making his consumption choices, the consumer takes as given the 
relative price of the two goods and then chooses an optimum at which his marginal 
rate of substitution equals this relative price. The relative price is the rate at which 
the market is willing to trade one good for the other, whereas the marginal rate of 
substitution is the rate at which the consumer is willing to trade one good for the 
other. At the consumer’s optimum, the consumer’s valuation of the two goods (as 
measured by the marginal rate of substitution) equals the market’s valuation (as 
measured by the relative price). As a result of this consumer optimization, market 
prices of different goods reflect the value that consumers place on those goods.
FYI
 Utility: An Alternative Way to Describe 
Preferences and Optimization
W
e have used indifference curves to represent the consumer’s 
preferences. Another common way to represent preferences 
is with the concept of utility. Utility is an abstract measure of the 
satisfaction or happiness that a consumer receives from a bundle of 
goods. Economists say that a consumer prefers one bundle of goods 
to another if one provides more utility than the other. 
	
Indifference curves and utility are closely related. Because the 
consumer prefers points on higher indifference curves, bundles of 
goods on higher indifference curves provide higher utility. Because 
the consumer is equally happy with all points on the same indiffer-
ence curve, all these bundles provide the same utility. You can think 
of an indifference curve as an “equal-utility” curve.
	
The marginal utility of any good is the increase in utility that the 
consumer gets from an additional unit of that good. Most goods 
are assumed to exhibit diminishing marginal utility: The more of 
the good the consumer already has, the lower the marginal utility 
provided by an extra unit of that good.
	
The marginal rate of substitution between two goods depends 
on their marginal utilities. For example, if the marginal utility of good 
X is twice the marginal utility of good Y, then a person would need 
2 units of good Y to compensate for losing 1 unit of good X, and the 
marginal rate of substitution equals 2. More generally, the marginal 
rate of substitution (and thus the slope of the indifference curve) 
equals the marginal utility of one good divided by the marginal utility 
of the other good.
	
Utility analysis provides another way to describe consumer opti-
mization. Recall that at the consumer’s optimum, the marginal rate 
of substitution equals the ratio of prices. That is,
MRS = PX / PY.
Because the marginal rate of substitution equals the ratio of mar-
ginal utilities, we can write this condition for optimization as
MUX / MUY = PX / PY.
Now rearrange this expression to become
MUX / PX = MUY / PY.
This equation has a simple interpretation: At the optimum, the mar-
ginal utility per dollar spent on good X equals the marginal utility 
per dollar spent on good Y. (Why? If this equality did not hold, the 
consumer could increase utility by spending less on the good that 
provided lower marginal utility per dollar and more on the good that 
provided higher marginal utility per dollar.)
	
When economists discuss the theory of consumer choice, they 
might express the theory using different words. One economist might 
say that the goal of the consumer is to maximize utility. Another 
economist might say that the goal of the consumer is to end up on 
the highest possible indifference curve. The first economist would 
conclude that at the consumer’s optimum, the marginal utility per 
dollar is the same for all goods, whereas the second would conclude 
that the indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint. In 
essence, these are two ways of saying the same thing.

How Changes in Income Affect  
the Consumer’s Choices
Now that we have seen how the consumer makes a consumption decision, let’s 
examine how this decision responds to changes in the consumer’s income. To be 
specific, suppose that income increases. With higher income, the consumer can 
afford more of both goods. The increase in income, therefore, shifts the budget 
constraint outward, as in Figure 7. Because the relative price of the two goods has 
not changed, the slope of the new budget constraint is the same as the slope of the 
initial budget constraint. That is, an increase in income leads to a parallel shift in 
the budget constraint.
The expanded budget constraint allows the consumer to choose a better com-
bination of pizza and Pepsi, one that is on a higher indifference curve. Given the 
shift in the budget constraint and the consumer’s preferences as represented by 
his indifference curves, the consumer’s optimum moves from the point labeled 
“initial optimum” to the point labeled “new optimum.”
Notice that, in Figure 7, the consumer chooses to consume more Pepsi and 
more pizza. Although the logic of the model does not require increased consump-
tion of both goods in response to increased income, this situation is the most 
common one. As you may recall from Chapter 4, if a consumer wants more of a 
good when his income rises, economists call it a normal good. The indifference 
curves in Figure 7 are drawn under the assumption that both pizza and Pepsi are 
normal goods. 
 Figure 8 shows an example in which an increase in income induces the con-
sumer to buy more pizza but less Pepsi. If a consumer buys less of a good when 
his income rises, economists call it an inferior good. Figure 8 is drawn under the 
assumption that pizza is a normal good and Pepsi is an inferior good.

CHAPTER 21    The Theory of Consumer Choice
Although most goods are normal goods, there are some inferior goods in the 
world. One example is bus rides. As income increases, consumers are more likely 
to own cars or take a taxi and less likely to ride a bus. Bus rides, therefore, are an 
inferior good.
How Changes in Prices Affect  
the Consumer’s Choices
Let’s now use this model of consumer choice to consider how a change in the 
price of one of the goods alters the consumer’s choices. Suppose, in particular, 
that the price of Pepsi falls from $2 to $1 per pint. It is no surprise that the lower 
price expands the consumer’s set of buying opportunities. In other words, a fall 
in the price of any good shifts the budget constraint outward.
Figure 9 considers more specifically how the fall in price affects the budget con-
straint. If the consumer spends his entire $1,000 income on pizza, then the price of 
Pepsi is irrelevant. Thus, point A in the figure stays the same. Yet if the consumer 
spends his entire income of $1,000 on Pepsi, he can now buy 1,000 rather than 
only 500 pints. Thus, the end point of the budget constraint moves from point B 
to point D. 
Notice that in this case the outward shift in the budget constraint changes its 
slope. (This differs from what happened previously when prices stayed the same 
but the consumer’s income changed.) As we have discussed, the slope of the budget 
constraint reflects the relative price of pizza and Pepsi. Because the price of Pepsi 
has fallen to $1 from $2, while the price of pizza has remained $10, the consumer 
can now trade a pizza for 10 rather than 5 pints of Pepsi. As a result, the new budget 
constraint has a steeper slope.

How such a change in the budget constraint alters the consumption of both 
goods depends on the consumer’s preferences. For the indifference curves drawn 
in this figure, the consumer buys more Pepsi and less pizza.
Income and Substitution Effects
The impact of a change in the price of a good on consumption can be decomposed 
into two effects: an income effect and a substitution effect. To see what these two 
effects are, consider how our consumer might respond when he learns that the 
price of Pepsi has fallen. He might reason in the following ways:
• 	 “Great news! Now that Pepsi is cheaper, my income has greater purchasing 
power. I am, in effect, richer than I was. Because I am richer, I can buy both 
more pizza and more Pepsi.” (This is the income effect.)
• 	 “Now that the price of Pepsi has fallen, I get more pints of Pepsi for every 
pizza that I give up. Because pizza is now relatively more expensive, I 
should buy less pizza and more Pepsi.” (This is the substitution effect.) 
Which statement do you find more compelling?
In fact, both of these statements make sense. The decrease in the price of Pepsi 
makes the consumer better off. If pizza and Pepsi are both normal goods, the con-
sumer will want to spread this improvement in his purchasing power over both 
goods. This income effect tends to make the consumer buy more pizza and more 
Pepsi. Yet at the same time, consumption of Pepsi has become less expensive rela-
tive to consumption of pizza. This substitution effect tends to make the consumer 
choose less pizza and more Pepsi.
Now consider the result of these two effects working at the same time. The 
consumer certainly buys more Pepsi because the income and substitution effects 
both act to raise purchases of Pepsi. But it is ambiguous whether the consumer 
buys more pizza because the income and substitution effects work in opposite 
directions. This conclusion is summarized in Table 1.

CHAPTER 21    The Theory of Consumer Choice
We can interpret the income and substitution effects using indifference curves. 
The income effect is the change in consumption that results from the movement to a higher 
indifference curve. The substitution effect is the change in consumption that results from 
being at a point on an indifference curve with a different marginal rate of substitution. 
Figure 10 shows graphically how to decompose the change in the consumer’s 
decision into the income effect and the substitution effect. When the price of Pepsi 
falls, the consumer moves from the initial optimum, point A, to the new opti-
mum, point C. We can view this change as occurring in two steps. First, the con-
sumer moves along the initial indifference curve, I1, from point A to point B. The 
consumer is equally happy at these two points, but at point B, the marginal rate

of substitution reflects the new relative price. (The dashed line through point B 
reflects the new relative price by being parallel to the new budget constraint.) 
Next, the consumer shifts to the higher indifference curve, I2, by moving from 
point B to point C. Even though point B and point C are on different indifference 
curves, they have the same marginal rate of substitution. That is, the slope of 
the indifference curve I1 at point B equals the slope of the indifference curve I2 at 
point C.
Although the consumer never actually chooses point B, this hypothetical point 
is useful to clarify the two effects that determine the consumer’s decision. Notice 
that the change from point A to point B represents a pure change in the marginal 
rate of substitution without any change in the consumer’s welfare. Similarly, the 
change from point B to point C represents a pure change in welfare without any 
change in the marginal rate of substitution. Thus, the movement from A to B shows 
the substitution effect, and the movement from B to C shows the income effect. 
Deriving the Demand Curve
We have just seen how changes in the price of a good alter the consumer’s budget 
constraint and, therefore, the quantities of the two goods that he chooses to buy. 
The demand curve for any good reflects these consumption decisions. Recall that 
a demand curve shows the quantity demanded of a good for any given price. We 
can view a consumer’s demand curve as a summary of the optimal decisions that 
arise from his budget constraint and indifference curves.
For example, Figure 11 considers the demand for Pepsi. Panel (a) shows that 
when the price of a pint falls from $2 to $1, the consumer’s budget constraint shifts 
outward. Because of both income and substitution effects, the consumer increases

that results from this consumer’s decisions. In this way, the theory of consumer 
choice provides the theoretical foundation for the consumer’s demand curve.
It may be comforting to know that the demand curve arises naturally from the 
theory of consumer choice, but this exercise by itself does not justify developing 
the theory. There is no need for a rigorous, analytic framework just to establish that 
people respond to changes in prices. The theory of consumer choice is, however, 
useful in studying various decisions that people make as they go about their lives, 
as we see in the next section.

Three Applications
Now that we have developed the basic theory of consumer choice, let’s use it to 
shed light on three questions about how the economy works. These three ques-
tions might at first seem unrelated. But because each question involves household 
decision making, we can address it with the model of consumer behavior we have 
just developed.
Do All Demand Curves Slope Downward?
Normally, when the price of a good rises, people buy less of it. This usual behav-
ior, called the law of demand, is reflected in the downward slope of the demand 
curve.
As a matter of economic theory, however, demand curves can sometimes slope 
upward. In other words, consumers can sometimes violate the law of demand and 
buy more of a good when the price rises. To see how this can happen, consider 
Figure 12. In this example, the consumer buys two goods—meat and potatoes. 
Initially, the consumer’s budget constraint is the line from point A to point B. The 
optimum is point C. When the price of potatoes rises, the budget constraint shifts 
inward and is now the line from point A to point D. The optimum is now point 
E. Notice that a rise in the price of potatoes has led the consumer to buy a larger 
quantity of potatoes.
Why is the consumer responding in a seemingly perverse way? In this exam-
ple, potatoes are a strongly inferior good. When the price of potatoes rises, the 
consumer is poorer. The income effect makes the consumer want to buy less meat 
and more potatoes. At the same time, because the potatoes have become more 
expensive relative to meat, the substitution effect makes the consumer want to 
buy more meat and fewer potatoes. In this particular case, however, the income 
effect is so strong that it exceeds the substitution effect. In the end, the consumer 
responds to the higher price of potatoes by buying less meat and more potatoes.
Economists use the term Giffen good to describe a good that violates the law 
of demand. (The term is named for economist Robert Giffen, who first noted this 
possibility.) In this example, potatoes are a Giffen good. Giffen goods are inferior 
goods for which the income effect dominates the substitution effect. Therefore, 
they have demand curves that slope upward.

The Search for Giffen Goods 
Have any actual Giffen goods ever been observed? Some historians suggest that 
potatoes were a Giffen good during the Irish potato famine of the 19th century. 
Potatoes were such a large part of people’s diet that when the price of potatoes 
rose, it had a large income effect. People responded to their reduced living stan-
dard by cutting back on the luxury of meat and buying more of the staple food 
of potatoes. Thus, it is argued that a higher price of potatoes actually raised the 
quantity of potatoes demanded.
	
A recent study by Robert Jensen and Nolan Miller has produced similar but 
more concrete evidence for the existence of Giffen goods. These two economists 
conducted a field experiment for five months in the Chinese province of Hunan. 
They gave randomly selected households vouchers that subsidized the purchase 
of rice, a staple in local diets, and used surveys to measure how consumption 
of rice responded to changes in the price. They found strong evidence that poor 
households exhibited Giffen behavior. Lowering the price of rice with the sub-
sidy voucher caused households to reduce their consumption of rice, and remov-
ing the subsidy had the opposite effect. Jensen and Miller wrote, “To the best of 
our knowledge, this is the first rigorous empirical evidence of Giffen behavior.”
	
Thus, the theory of consumer choice allows demand curves to slope upward, and 
sometimes that strange phenomenon actually occurs. As a result, the law of demand 
we first saw in Chapter 4 is not completely reliable. It is safe to say, however, that 
Giffen goods are very rare.  ■
How Do Wages Affect Labor Supply?
So far, we have used the theory of consumer choice to analyze how a person allo-
cates income between two goods. We can use the same theory to analyze how a 
person allocates time. People spend some of their time enjoying leisure and some

CHAPTER 21    The Theory of Consumer Choice
of it working so they can afford to buy consumption goods. The essence of the 
time-allocation problem is the trade-off between leisure and consumption.
Consider the decision facing Sally, a freelance software designer. Sally is awake 
for 100 hours per week. She spends some of this time enjoying leisure—riding 
her bike, watching television, and studying economics. She spends the rest of this 
time at her computer developing software. For every hour she works developing 
software, she earns $50, which she spends on consumption goods—food, clothing, 
and music downloads. Her wage ($50) reflects the trade-off Sally faces between 
leisure and consumption. For every hour of leisure she gives up, she works one 
more hour and gets $50 of consumption.
Figure 13 shows Sally’s budget constraint. If she spends all 100 hours enjoying 
leisure, she has no consumption. If she spends all 100 hours working, she earns a 
weekly consumption of $5,000 but has no time for leisure. If she works a normal 
40-hour week, she enjoys 60 hours of leisure and has weekly consumption of $2,000.
Figure 13 uses indifference curves to represent Sally’s preferences for con-
sumption and leisure. Here consumption and leisure are the two “goods” 
between which Sally is choosing. Because Sally always prefers more leisure and 
more consumption, she prefers points on higher indifference curves to points on 
lower ones. At a wage of $50 per hour, Sally chooses a combination of consump-
tion and leisure represented by the point labeled “optimum.” This is the point on 
the budget constraint that is on the highest possible indifference curve, I2.
Now consider what happens when Sally’s wage increases from $50 to $60 per 
hour. Figure 14 shows two possible outcomes. In each case, the budget constraint, 
shown in the left graphs, shifts outward from BC1 to BC2. In the process, the budget 
constraint becomes steeper, reflecting the change in relative price: At the higher 
wage, Sally earns more consumption for every hour of leisure that she gives up.
Sally’s preferences, as represented by her indifference curves, determine how 
her choice regarding consumption and leisure responds to the higher wage. In 
both panels, consumption rises. Yet the response of leisure to the change in the 
wage is different in the two cases. In panel (a), Sally responds to the higher wage 
by enjoying less leisure. In panel (b), Sally responds by enjoying more leisure.
Sally’s decision between leisure and consumption determines her supply of labor 
because the more leisure she enjoys, the less time she has left to work. In each panel

The two panels of this figure show how a person might respond to an increase in the 
wage. The graphs on the left show the consumer’s initial budget constraint, BC1, and 
new budget constraint, BC2, as well as the consumer’s optimal choices over consumption 
and leisure. The graphs on the right show the resulting labor-supply curve. Because 
hours worked equal total hours available minus hours of leisure, any change in leisure 
implies an opposite change in the quantity of labor supplied. In panel (a), when the 
wage rises, consumption rises and leisure falls, resulting in a labor-supply curve that 
slopes upward. In panel (b), when the wage rises, both consumption and leisure rise, 
resulting in a labor-supply curve that slopes backward.

of Figure 14, the right graph shows the labor-supply curve implied by Sally’s deci-
sion. In panel (a), a higher wage induces Sally to enjoy less leisure and work more, 
so the labor-supply curve slopes upward. In panel (b), a higher wage induces Sally 
to enjoy more leisure and work less, so the labor-supply curve slopes “backward.” 
At first, the backward-sloping labor-supply curve is puzzling. Why would a 
person respond to a higher wage by working less? The answer comes from con-
sidering the income and substitution effects of a higher wage.

CHAPTER 21    The Theory of Consumer Choice
Consider first the substitution effect. When Sally’s wage rises, leisure becomes 
more costly relative to consumption, and this encourages Sally to substitute away 
from leisure and toward consumption. In other words, the substitution effect 
induces Sally to work harder in response to higher wages, which tends to make 
the labor-supply curve slope upward.
Now consider the income effect. When Sally’s wage rises, she moves to a higher 
indifference curve. She is now better off than she was. As long as consumption 
and leisure are both normal goods, she tends to want to use this increase in well-
being to enjoy both higher consumption and greater leisure. In other words, the 
income effect induces her to work less, which tends to make the labor-supply 
curve slope backward. 
In the end, economic theory does not give a clear prediction about whether an 
increase in the wage induces Sally to work more or less. If the substitution effect 
is greater than the income effect for Sally, she works more. If the income effect is 
greater than the substitution effect, she works less. The labor-supply curve, there-
fore, could be either upward or backward sloping.
Income Effects on Labor Supply: Historical Trends, 
Lottery Winners, and the Carnegie Conjecture
The idea of a backward-sloping labor-supply curve might at first seem like a mere 
theoretical curiosity, but in fact, it is not. Evidence indicates that the labor-supply 
curve, considered over long periods, does in fact slope backward. A hundred 
years ago, many people worked six days a week. Today, five-day workweeks are 
the norm. At the same time that the length of the workweek has been falling, the 
wage of the typical worker (adjusted for inflation) has been rising.
	
Here is how economists explain this historical pattern: Over time, advances in 
technology raise workers’ productivity and, thereby, the demand for labor. This 
increase in labor demand raises equilibrium wages. As wages rise, so does the 
reward for working. Yet rather than responding to this increased incentive by 
working more, most workers choose to take part of their greater prosperity in the 
form of more leisure. In other words, the income effect of higher wages dominates 
the substitution effect.
	
Further evidence that the income effect on labor supply is strong comes from 
a very different kind of data: winners of lotteries. Winners of large prizes in the 
lottery see large increases in their incomes and, as a result, large outward shifts in 
their budget constraints. Because the winners’ wages have not changed, however, 
the slopes of their budget constraints remain the same. There is, therefore, no sub-
stitution effect. By examining the behavior of lottery winners, we can isolate the 
income effect on labor supply.
	
The results from studies of lottery winners are striking. Of those winners who 
win more than $50,000, almost 25 percent quit working within a year, and another 
9 percent reduce the number of hours they work. Of those winners who win more 
than $1 million, almost 40 percent stop working. The income effect on labor sup-
ply of winning such a large prize is substantial.
	
Similar results were found in a 1993 study, published in the Quarterly Journal of 
Economics, of how receiving a bequest affects a person’s labor supply. The study 
found that a single person who inherits more than $150,000 is four times as likely to 
stop working as a single person who inherits less than $25,000. This finding would 
not have surprised the 19th-century industrialist Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie 
warned that “the parent who leaves his son enormous wealth generally deadens the 
talents and energies of the son, and tempts him to lead a less useful and less worthy

supply to be substantial and, from his paternalistic perspective, regrettable. During

CHAPTER 21    The Theory of Consumer Choice
How Do Interest Rates Affect Household Saving?
An important decision that every person faces is how much income to consume 
today and how much to save for the future. We can use the theory of consumer 
choice to analyze how people make this decision and how the amount they save 
depends on the interest rate their savings will earn.
Consider the decision facing Sam, a worker planning for retirement. To keep 
things simple, let’s divide Sam’s life into two periods. In the first period, Sam is 
young and working. In the second period, he is old and retired. When young, Sam 
earns $100,000. He divides this income between current consumption and saving. 
When he is old, Sam will consume what he has saved, including the interest that 
his savings have earned.
Suppose the interest rate is 10 percent. Then for every dollar that Sam saves 
when young, he can consume $1.10 when old. We can view “consumption when 
young” and “consumption when old” as the two goods that Sam must choose 
between. The interest rate determines the relative price of these two goods. 
Figure 15 shows Sam’s budget constraint. If he saves nothing, he consumes 
$100,000 when young and nothing when old. If he saves everything, he consumes 
nothing when young and $110,000 when old. The budget constraint shows these 
and all the intermediate possibilities.
Figure 15 uses indifference curves to represent Sam’s preferences for consump-
tion in the two periods. Because Sam prefers more consumption in both periods, 
he prefers points on higher indifference curves to points on lower ones. Given 
his preferences, Sam chooses the optimal combination of consumption in both 
periods of life, which is the point on the budget constraint that is on the highest 
possible indifference curve. At this optimum, Sam consumes $50,000 when young 
and $55,000 when old.

Decision

Now consider what happens when the interest rate increases from 10 percent 
to 20 percent. Figure 16 shows two possible outcomes. In both cases, the budget 
constraint shifts outward and becomes steeper. At the new higher interest rate, 
Sam gets more consumption when old for every dollar of consumption that he 
gives up when young.
The two panels show the results given different preferences by Sam. In both 
cases, consumption when old rises. Yet the response of consumption when young 
to the change in the interest rate is different in the two cases. In panel (a), Sam 
responds to the higher interest rate by consuming less when young. In panel 
(b), Sam responds by consuming more when young. 
Sam’s saving is his income when young minus the amount he consumes 
when young. In panel (a), consumption when young falls when the interest rate 
rises, so saving must rise. In panel (b), Sam consumes more when young, so 
saving must fall. 
The case shown in panel (b) might at first seem odd: Sam responds to an 
increase in the return to saving by saving less. Yet this behavior is not as peculiar 
as it might seem. We can understand it by considering the income and substitu-
tion effects of a higher interest rate.
Consider first the substitution effect. When the interest rate rises, consumption 
when old becomes less costly relative to consumption when young. Therefore, the 
substitution effect induces Sam to consume more when old and less when young. 
In other words, the substitution effect induces Sam to save more. 
Figure 16
An Increase in the  
Interest Rate
In both panels, an increase in the interest rate shifts the budget constraint outward. In 
panel (a), consumption when young falls, and consumption when old rises. The result is 
an increase in saving when young. In panel (b), consumption in both periods rises. The 
result is a decrease in saving when young.

CHAPTER 21    The Theory of Consumer Choice
Now consider the income effect. When the interest rate rises, Sam moves to a 
higher indifference curve. He is now better off than he was. As long as consump-
tion in both periods consists of normal goods, he tends to want to use this increase 
in well-being to enjoy higher consumption in both periods. In other words, the 
income effect induces him to save less. 
The result depends on both the income and substitution effects. If the substi-
tution effect of a higher interest rate is greater than the income effect, Sam saves 
more. If the income effect is greater than the substitution effect, Sam saves less. 
Thus, the theory of consumer choice says that an increase in the interest rate could 
either encourage or discourage saving.
This ambiguous result is interesting from the standpoint of economic theory, 
but it is disappointing from the standpoint of economic policy. It turns out that 
an important issue in tax policy hinges in part on how saving responds to interest 
rates. Some economists have advocated reducing the taxation of interest and other 
capital income, arguing that such a policy change would raise the after-tax inter-
est rate that savers can earn and would thereby encourage people to save more. 
Other economists have argued that because of offsetting income and substitution 
effects, such a tax change might not increase saving and could even reduce it. 
Unfortunately, research has not led to a consensus about how interest rates affect 
saving. As a result, there remains disagreement among economists about whether 
changes in tax policy aimed to encourage saving would, in fact, have the intended 
effect.

amount that a person wants to work. 
Conclusion: Do People Really Think This Way?
The theory of consumer choice describes how people make decisions. As we 
have seen, it has broad applicability. It can explain how a person chooses 
between pizza and Pepsi, work and leisure, consumption and saving, and on 
and on. 
At this point, however, you might be tempted to treat the theory of con-
sumer choice with some skepticism. After all, you are a consumer. You decide 
what to buy every time you walk into a store. And you know that you do not 
decide by writing down budget constraints and indifference curves. Doesn’t 
this knowledge about your own decision making provide evidence against the 
theory?
The answer is no. The theory of consumer choice does not try to present a literal 
account of how people make decisions. It is a model. And as we first discussed in 
Chapter 2, models are not intended to be completely realistic.
The best way to view the theory of consumer choice is as a metaphor for how 
consumers make decisions. No consumer (except an occasional economist) goes 
through the explicit optimization envisioned in the theory. Yet consumers are 
aware that their choices are constrained by their financial resources. And given 
those constraints, they do the best they can to achieve the highest level of satisfac-
tion. The theory of consumer choice tries to describe this implicit, psychological 
process in a way that permits explicit, economic analysis.

Summary
• A consumer’s budget constraint shows the pos-
sible combinations of different goods he can buy 
given his income and the prices of the goods. 
The slope of the budget constraint equals the 
relative price of the goods.
• The consumer’s indifference curves represent 
his preferences. An indifference curve shows 
the various bundles of goods that make the 
consumer equally happy. Points on higher indif-
ference curves are preferred to points on lower 
indifference curves. The slope of an indifference 
curve at any point is the consumer’s marginal 
rate of substitution—the rate at which the con-
sumer is willing to trade one good for the other.
• The consumer optimizes by choosing the point 
on his budget constraint that lies on the highest 
indifference curve. At this point, the slope of the 
indifference curve (the marginal rate of substitu-
tion between the goods) equals the slope of the 
budget constraint (the relative price of the goods).
• When the price of a good falls, the impact on 
the consumer’s choices can be broken down 
into an income effect and a substitution effect. 
The income effect is the change in consump-
tion that arises because a lower price makes the 
consumer better off. The substitution effect is 
the change in consumption that arises because 
a price change encourages greater consumption 
of the good that has become relatively cheaper. 
The income effect is reflected in the movement 
from a lower to a higher indifference curve, 
whereas the substitution effect is reflected by a 
movement along an indifference curve to a point 
with a different slope.
• The theory of consumer choice can be applied in 
many situations. It explains why demand curves 
can potentially slope upward, why higher wages 
could either increase or decrease the quantity of 
labor supplied, and why higher interest rates 
could either increase or decrease saving.

applications. In the last section of this chapter, we applied the theory of consumer 
choice to three practical issues about the economy. If you take more advanced 
courses in economics, you will see that this theory provides the framework for 
much additional analysis.

	11.	 Daniel is a diligent student who loves getting 
As, but he also loves watching movies. Daniel 
is awake for 100 hours each week, and study-
ing and watching movies are his only two 
­activities. Daniel must study for 20 hours per

incomes rise, they will surely buy less when 
the price of the commodity rises.” Explain this 
statement using the concepts of income and 
substitution effects.

needy families. Typically, the maximum  
payment goes to families that earn no income; 
then, as families begin to earn income, the  
welfare payment declines gradually and  
eventually disappears. Let’s consider the  
possible effects of this program on a family’s 
labor supply.

assuming that the welfare system did not 
exist. On the same diagram, draw a budget 
constraint that reflects the existence of the 
welfare system.
