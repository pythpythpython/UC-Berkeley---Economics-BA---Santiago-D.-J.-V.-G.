    Microeconomics
E
conomics is a study of the choices that people make and the resulting 
interactions they have with one another. This study has many facets, 
as we have seen in the preceding chapters. Yet it would be a mistake to 
think that all the facets we have seen make up a finished jewel, perfect 
and unchanging. Like all scientists, economists are always on the lookout for new 
areas to study and new phenomena to explain. This final chapter on microeco-
nomics offers an assortment of three topics at the discipline’s frontier to see how 
economists are trying to expand their understanding of human behavior and 
society. 
The first topic is the economics of asymmetric information. In many different 
situations, some people are better informed than others, and the imbalance in 
information affects the choices they make and how they deal with one another. 
Thinking about this asymmetry can shed light on many aspects of the world, from 
the market for used cars to the custom of gift giving.

The second topic we examine in this chapter is political economy. Throughout 
this book, we have seen many examples in which markets fail and government 
policy can potentially improve matters. But “potentially” is a necessary qualifier: 
Whether this potential is realized depends on how well our political institutions 
work. The field of political economy uses the tools of economics to understand the 
functioning of government.
The third topic in this chapter is behavioral economics. This field brings some of 
the insights from psychology into the study of economic issues. It offers a view of 
human behavior that is more subtle and complex than that found in conventional 
economic theory, a view that may be more realistic.
This chapter covers a lot of ground. To do so, it offers not a full helping of these 
three topics but, instead, a taste of each. One goal is to show a few of the directions 
economists are heading in their effort to expand knowledge of how the economy 
works. Another goal is to whet your appetite for more courses in economics.
Asymmetric Information 
“I know something you don’t know.” This statement is a common taunt among 
children, but it also conveys a deep truth about how people sometimes interact 
with one another. Many times in life, one person knows more about what is going 
on than another. A difference in access to relevant knowledge is called an informa-
tion asymmetry.
Examples abound. A worker knows more than his employer about how much 
effort he puts into his job. A seller of a used car knows more than the buyer about 
the car’s condition. The first is an example of a hidden action, whereas the second 
is an example of a hidden characteristic. In each case, the uninformed party (the 
employer, the car buyer) would like to know the relevant information, but the 
informed party (the worker, the car seller) may have an incentive to conceal it.
Because asymmetric information is so prevalent, economists have devoted 
much effort in recent decades to studying its effects. And indeed, the 2001 Nobel 
Prize in Economics was awarded to three economists (George Akerlof, Michael 
Spence, and Joseph Stiglitz) for their pioneering work on this topic. Let’s discuss 
some of the insights that this study has revealed.
Hidden Actions: Principals, Agents,  
and Moral Hazard
Moral hazard is a problem that arises when one person, called the agent, is per-
forming some task on behalf of another person, called the principal. If the prin-
cipal cannot perfectly monitor the agent’s behavior, the agent tends to undertake 
less effort than the principal considers desirable. The phrase moral hazard refers 
to the risk, or “hazard,” of inappropriate or otherwise “immoral” behavior by the 
agent. In such a situation, the principal tries various ways to encourage the agent 
to act more responsibly.
The employment relationship is the classic example. The employer is the prin-
cipal, and the worker is the agent. The moral-hazard problem is the temptation 
of imperfectly monitored workers to shirk their responsibilities. Employers can 
respond to this problem in various ways:
• 	 Better monitoring. Parents hiring nannies have been known to plant hidden 
video cameras in their homes to record the nanny’s behavior when the 
parents are away. The aim is to catch irresponsible behavior.

• 	 High wages. According to efficiency-wage theories (discussed in Chapter 19), 
some employers may choose to pay their workers a wage above the level 
that balances supply and demand in the labor market. A worker who earns 
an above-equilibrium wage is less likely to shirk because, if he is caught and 
fired, he might not be able to find another high-paying job.
• 	 Delayed payment. Firms can delay part of a worker’s compensation, so if 
the worker is caught shirking and is fired, he suffers a larger penalty. One 
example of delayed compensation is the year-end bonus. Similarly, a firm 
may choose to pay its workers more later in their lives. Thus, the wage 
increases that workers get as they age may reflect not just the benefits of 
experience but also a response to moral hazard.
FYI
 Corporate Management
M
uch production in the modern economy takes place within 
corporations. Like other firms, corporations buy inputs in mar-
kets for the factors of production and sell their output in markets 
for goods and services. Also like other firms, they are guided in 
their decisions by the objective of profit maximization. But a large 
corporation has to deal with some issues that do not arise in, say, a 
small family-owned business.
	
What is distinctive about a corporation? From a legal standpoint, 
a corporation is an organization that is granted a charter recognizing 
it as a separate legal entity, with its own rights and responsibilities 
distinct from those of its owners and employees. From an economic 
standpoint, the most important feature of the corporate form of 
organization is the separation of ownership and control. One group 
of people, called the shareholders, own the corporation and share 
in its profits. Another group of people, called the managers, are 
employed by the corporation to make decisions about how to deploy 
the corporation’s resources.
	
The separation of ownership and control creates a principal-
agent problem. In this case, the shareholders are the principals, and 
the managers are the agents. The chief executive officer and other 
managers, who are in the best position to know the available busi-
ness opportunities, are charged with the task of maximizing profits 
for the shareholders. But ensuring that they carry out this task is not 
always easy. The managers may have goals of their own, such as 
taking life easy, having a plush office and a private jet, throwing lav-
ish parties, or presiding over a large business empire. The managers’ 
goals may not always coincide with the goal of profit maximization.
	
The corporation’s board of directors is responsible for hiring 
and firing the top management. The board monitors the managers’ 
performance, and it designs their compensation packages. These 
packages often include incentives aimed at aligning the interests 
of shareholders with the interests of management. Managers might 
be given bonuses based on performance or options to buy the com-
pany’s stock, which are more valuable if the company performs well.
	
Note, however, that the directors are themselves agents of the 
shareholders. The existence of a board overseeing management only 
shifts the principal-agent problem. The issue then becomes how to 
ensure that the board of directors fulfills its own legal obligation 
of acting in the best interest of the shareholders. If the directors 
become too friendly with management, they may not provide the 
required oversight.
	
The corporation’s principal-agent problem became big news 
around 2005. The top managers of several prominent companies, 
such as Enron, Tyco, and WorldCom, were found to be engaging in 
activities that enriched themselves at the expense of their sharehold-
ers. In these cases, the actions were so extreme as to be criminal, 
and the corporate managers were not just fired but also sent to 
prison. Some shareholders sued directors for failing to monitor 
management sufficiently.
	
Fortunately, criminal activity by corporate managers is rare. But 
in some ways, it is only the tip of the iceberg. Whenever ownership 
and control are separated, as they are in most large corporations, 
there is an inevitable tension between the interests of shareholders 
and the interests of management.

Employers can use any combination of these various mechanisms to reduce the 
problem of moral hazard.
There are also many examples of moral hazard beyond the workplace. A 
homeowner with fire insurance will likely buy too few fire extinguishers because 
the homeowner bears the cost of the extinguisher while the insurance company 
receives much of the benefit. A family may live near a river with a high risk of 
flooding because the family enjoys the scenic views, while the government bears 
the cost of disaster relief after a flood. Many regulations are aimed at addressing 
the problem: An insurance company may require homeowners to buy fire extin-
guishers, and the government may prohibit building homes on land with high 
risk of flooding. But the insurance company does not have perfect information 
about how cautious homeowners are, and the government does not have perfect 
information about the risk that families undertake when choosing where to live. 
As a result, the problem of moral hazard persists.
Hidden Characteristics: Adverse Selection  
and the Lemons Problem
Adverse selection is a problem that arises in markets in which the seller knows 
more about the attributes of the good being sold than the buyer does. In such 
a situation, the buyer runs the risk of being sold a good of low quality. That is, 
the “selection” of goods sold may be “adverse” from the standpoint of the unin-
formed buyer.
The classic example of adverse selection is the market for used cars. Sellers of 
used cars know their vehicles’ defects while buyers often do not. Because owners 
of the worst cars are more likely to sell them than are the owners of the best cars, 
buyers are apprehensive about getting a “lemon.” As a result, many people avoid 
buying vehicles in the used car market. This lemons problem can explain why a 
used car only a few weeks old sells for thousands of dollars less than a new car 
of the same type. A buyer of the used car might surmise that the seller is getting 
rid of the car quickly because the seller knows something about it that the buyer 
does not.
A second example of adverse selection occurs in the labor market. According 
to another efficiency-wage theory, workers vary in their abilities, and they may 
know their own abilities better than do the firms that hire them. When a firm cuts 
the wage it pays, the more talented workers are more likely to quit, knowing they 
are better able to find other employment. Conversely, a firm may choose to pay 
an above-equilibrium wage to attract a better mix of workers. 
A third example of adverse selection occurs in markets for insurance. For 
example, buyers of health insurance know more about their own health prob-
lems than do insurance companies. Because people with greater hidden health 
problems are more likely to buy health insurance than are other people, the price 
of health insurance reflects the costs of a sicker-than-average person. As a result, 
people in average health may observe the high price of insurance and decide not 
to buy it.
When markets suffer from adverse selection, the invisible hand does not 
necessarily work its magic. In the used car market, owners of good cars may 
choose to keep them rather than sell them at the low price that skeptical buyers 
are willing to pay. In the labor market, wages may be stuck above the level that 
balances supply and demand, resulting in unemployment. In insurance markets, 
buyers with low risk may choose to remain uninsured because the policies they

are offered fail to reflect their true characteristics. Advocates of government-­
provided health insurance sometimes point to the problem of adverse selection 
as one reason not to trust the private market to provide the right amount of 
health insurance on its own.
Signaling to Convey Private Information
Although asymmetric information is sometimes a motivation for public policy, it 
also motivates some individual behavior that otherwise might be hard to explain. 
Markets respond to problems of asymmetric information in many ways. One of 
them is signaling, which refers to actions taken by an informed party for the sole 
purpose of credibly revealing his private information. 
We have seen examples of signaling in previous chapters. As we saw in Chapter 
16, firms may spend money on advertising to signal to potential customers that 
they have high-quality products. As we saw in Chapter 20, students may earn col-
lege degrees to signal to potential employers that they are high-ability individuals. 
Recall that the signaling theory of education contrasts with the human-capital 
theory, which asserts that education increases a person’s productivity, rather than 
merely conveying information about innate talent. These two examples of signal-
ing (advertising, education) may seem very different, but below the surface, they 
are much the same: In both cases, the informed party (the firm, the student) uses 
the signal to convince the uninformed party (the customer, the employer) that the 
informed party is offering something of high quality.
What does it take for an action to be an effective signal? Obviously, it must 
be costly. If a signal were free, everyone would use it, and it would convey no 
information. For the same reason, there is another requirement: The signal must 
be less costly, or more beneficial, to the person with the higher-quality product. 
Otherwise, everyone would have the same incentive to use the signal, and the 
signal would reveal nothing.
Consider again our two examples. In the advertising case, a firm with a good 
product reaps a larger benefit from advertising because customers who try the 
product once are more likely to become repeat customers. Thus, it is rational for 
the firm with a good product to pay for the cost of the signal (advertising), and it 
is rational for the customer to use the signal as a piece of information about the 
product’s quality. In the education case, a talented person can get through school 
more easily than a less talented one. Thus, it is rational for the talented person to 
pay for the cost of the signal (education), and it is rational for the employer to use 
the signal as a piece of information about the person’s talent.
The world is replete with instances of signaling. Magazine ads sometimes 
include the phrase “as seen on TV.” Why does a firm selling a product in a maga-
zine choose to stress this fact? One possibility is that the firm is trying to convey 
its willingness to pay for an expensive signal (a spot on television) in the hope that 
you will infer that its product is of high quality. For the same reason, graduates of 
elite schools are always sure to put that fact on their résumés.
Gifts as Signals
A man is debating what to give his girlfriend for her birthday. “I know,” he says 
to himself, “I’ll give her cash. After all, I don’t know her tastes as well as she 
does, and with cash, she can buy anything she wants.” But when he hands her

the money, she is offended. Convinced he doesn’t really love her, she breaks off 
the relationship.
	
What’s the economics behind this story?
	
In some ways, gift giving is a strange custom. As the man in our story suggests, 
people typically know their own preferences better than others do, so we might 
expect everyone to prefer cash to in-kind transfers. If your employer substituted 
merchandise of his choosing for your paycheck, you would likely object to this 
means of payment. But your reaction is very different when someone who (you 
hope) loves you does the same thing.
	
One interpretation of gift giving is that it reflects asymmetric information and 
signaling. The man in our story has private information that the girlfriend would 
like to know: Does he really love her? Choosing a good gift for her is a signal of 
his love. Certainly, the act of picking out a gift, rather than giving cash, has the 
right characteristics to be a signal. It is costly (it takes time), and its cost depends 
on private information (how much he loves her). If he really loves her, choosing 
a good gift is easy because he is thinking about her all the time. If he doesn’t love 
her, finding the right gift is more difficult. Thus, giving a gift that suits the girl-
friend is one way for him to convey the private information of his love for her. 
Giving cash shows that he isn’t even bothering to try.
	
The signaling theory of gift giving is consistent with another observation: 
People care most about the custom when the strength of affection is most in 
question. Thus, giving cash to a girlfriend or boyfriend is usually a bad move. 
But when college students receive a check from their parents, they are less often 
offended. The parents’ love is less likely to be in doubt, so the recipient probably 
won’t interpret the cash gift as a signal of lack of affection.  ■
Screening to Uncover Private Information
When an informed party takes actions to reveal private information, the phe-
nomenon is called signaling. When an uninformed party takes actions to induce 
the informed party to reveal private information, the phenomenon is called 
screening.
Some screening is common sense. A person buying a used car may ask that it 
be checked by an auto mechanic before the sale. A seller who refuses this request 
reveals his private information that the car is a lemon. The buyer may decide to 
offer a lower price or to look for another car.
Other examples of screening are more subtle. For example, consider a firm that 
sells car insurance. The firm would like to charge a low premium to safe drivers 
and a high premium to risky drivers. But how can it tell them apart? Drivers know 
whether they are safe or risky, but the risky ones won’t admit it. A driver’s history 
is one piece of information (which insurance companies in fact use), but because 
of the intrinsic randomness of car accidents, history is an imperfect indicator of 
future risks.
The insurance company might be able to sort out the two kinds of drivers by 
offering different insurance policies that would induce them to separate them-
selves. One policy would have a high premium and cover the full cost of any acci-
dents that occur. Another policy would have low premiums but would have, say, 
a $1,000 deductible. (That is, the driver would be responsible for the first $1,000 of 
damage, and the insurance company would cover the remaining risk.) Notice that 
the deductible is more of a burden for risky drivers because they are more likely to 
have an accident. Thus, with a large enough deductible, the low-premium policy

with a deductible would attract the safe drivers, while the high-premium policy 
without a deductible would attract the risky drivers. Faced with these two poli-
cies, the two kinds of drivers would reveal their private information by choosing 
different insurance policies.
Asymmetric Information and Public Policy
We have examined two kinds of asymmetric information: moral hazard and 
adverse selection. And we have seen how individuals may respond to the prob-
lem with signaling or screening. Now let’s consider what the study of asymmetric 
information suggests about the proper scope of public policy.
The tension between market success and market failure is central in microeco-
nomics. We learned in Chapter 7 that the equilibrium of supply and demand is 
efficient in the sense that it maximizes the total surplus that society can obtain 
in a market. Adam Smith’s invisible hand seemed to reign supreme. This con-
clusion was then tempered with the study of externalities (Chapter 10), public 
goods (Chapter 11), imperfect competition (Chapters 15 through 17), and poverty 
(Chapter 20). These examples of market failure showed that government can 
sometimes improve market outcomes.
The study of asymmetric information gives us a new reason to be wary of 
markets. When some people know more than others, the market may fail to put 
resources to their best use. People with high-quality used cars may have trouble 
selling them because buyers will be afraid of getting a lemon. People with few 
health problems may have trouble getting low-cost health insurance because 
insurance companies lump them together with those who have significant (but 
hidden) health problems.
Asymmetric information may call for government action in some cases, but 
three facts complicate the issue. First, as we have seen, the private market can 
sometimes deal with information asymmetries on its own using a combination 
of signaling and screening. Second, the government rarely has more information 
than the private parties. Even if the market’s allocation of resources is not first-
best, it may be second-best. That is, when there are information asymmetries, 
policymakers may find it hard to improve upon the market’s admittedly imper-
fect outcome. Third, the government is itself an imperfect institution—a topic we 
take up in the next section.
Quick Quiz  A person who buys a life insurance policy pays a certain amount per 
year and receives for his family a much larger payment in the event of his death. 
Would you expect buyers of life insurance to have higher or lower death rates than 
the average person? How might this be an example of moral hazard? Of adverse selec-
tion? How might a life insurance company deal with these problems?
Political Economy
As we have seen, markets left on their own do not always reach a desirable allo-
cation of resources. When we judge the market’s outcome to be either inefficient 
or inequitable, there may be a role for the government to step in and improve the 
situation. Yet before we embrace an activist government, we need to consider one 
more fact: The government is also an imperfect institution. The field of political 
economy (sometimes called the field of public choice) applies the methods of eco-
nomics to study how government works.

The Condorcet Voting Paradox
Most advanced societies rely on democratic principles to set government policy. 
When a city is deciding between two locations to build a new park, for example, 
we have a simple way to choose: The majority gets its way. Yet for most policy 
issues, the number of possible outcomes far exceeds two. A new park, for instance, 
could be placed in many possible locations. In this case, as the 18th-century 
French political theorist Marquis de Condorcet famously noted, democracy might 
run into some problems trying to choose the best outcome.
For example, suppose there are three possible outcomes, labeled A, B, and C, 
and there are three voter types with the preferences shown in Table 1. The mayor 
of our town wants to aggregate these individual preferences into preferences for 
society as a whole. How should she do it?
At first, she might try some pairwise votes. If she asks voters to choose first 
between B and C, voter types 1 and 2 will vote for B, giving B the majority. If she 
then asks voters to choose between A and B, voter types 1 and 3 will vote for A, 
giving A the majority. Observing that A beats B, and B beats C, the mayor might 
conclude that A is the voters’ clear choice.
But wait: Suppose the mayor then asks voters to choose between A and C. In 
this case, voter types 2 and 3 vote for C, giving C the majority. That is, under pair-
wise majority voting, A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A. Normally, we expect 
preferences to exhibit a property called transitivity: If A is preferred to B, and B 
is preferred to C, then we would expect A to be preferred to C. The Condorcet 
paradox is that democratic outcomes do not always obey this property. Pairwise 
voting might produce transitive preferences for society in some cases, but as our 
example in the table shows, it cannot be counted on to do so.
One implication of the Condorcet paradox is that the order in which things are 
voted on can affect the result. If the mayor suggests choosing first between A and 
B and then comparing the winner to C, the town ends up choosing C. But if the 
voters choose first between B and C and then compare the winner to A, the town 
ends up with A. And if the voters choose first between A and C and then compare 
the winner to B, the town ends up with B.
The Condorcet paradox teaches two lessons. The narrow lesson is that when 
there are more than two options, setting the agenda (that is, deciding the order 
which items are voted on) can have a powerful influence over the outcome of a 
democratic election. The broad lesson is that majority voting by itself does not tell 
us what outcome a society really wants.

CHAPTER 22    Frontiers of Microeconomics
Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem
Since political theorists first noticed Condorcet’s paradox, they have spent 
much energy studying existing voting systems and proposing new ones. For 
example, as an alternative to pairwise majority voting, the mayor of our town 
could ask each voter to rank the possible outcomes. For each voter, we could 
give 1 point for last place, 2 points for second to last, 3 points for third to last, 
and so on. The outcome that receives the most total points wins. With the 
preferences in Table 1, outcome B is the winner. (You can do the arithmetic 
yourself.) This voting method is called a Borda count for the 18th-century French 
mathematician and political theorist who devised it. It is often used in polls that 
rank sports teams.
Is there a perfect voting system? Economist Kenneth Arrow took up this ques-
tion in his 1951 book Social Choice and Individual Values. Arrow started by defining 
what a perfect voting system would be. He assumes that individuals in society 
have preferences over the various possible outcomes: A, B, C, and so on. He then 
assumes that society wants a voting system to choose among these outcomes that 
satisfies several properties:
• 	 Unanimity: If everyone prefers A to B, then A should beat B.
• 	 Transitivity: If A beats B, and B beats C, then A should beat C.
• 	 Independence of irrelevant alternatives: The ranking between any two outcomes 
A and B should not depend on whether some third outcome C is also 
available.
• 	 No dictators: There is no person who always gets his way, regardless of 
everyone else’s preferences.
These all seem like desirable properties of a voting system. Yet Arrow proved, 
mathematically and incontrovertibly, that no voting system can satisfy all these prop-
erties. This amazing result is called Arrow’s impossibility theorem.
The mathematics needed to prove Arrow’s theorem is beyond the scope of 
this book, but we can get some sense of why the theorem is true from a couple of 
examples. We have already seen the problem with the method of majority rule. 
The Condorcet paradox shows that majority rule fails to produce a ranking of 
outcomes that always satisfies transitivity. 
As another example, the Borda count fails to satisfy the independence of irrel-
evant alternatives. Recall that, using the preferences in Table 1, outcome B wins 
with a Borda count. But suppose that suddenly C disappears as an alternative. If 
the Borda count method is applied only to outcomes A and B, then A wins. (Once 
again, you can do the arithmetic on your own.) Thus, eliminating alternative C 
changes the ranking between A and B. This change occurs because the result 
of the Borda count depends on the number of points that A and B receive, and 
the number of points depends on whether the irrelevant alternative, C, is also 
available.
Arrow’s impossibility theorem is a deep and disturbing result. It doesn’t say

And the Oscar Goes 
to ... Not Its Voting 
System 
By Carl Bialik
A
cademy Award nominees and winners 
are selected using two different voting 
systems that are, according to some political 
mathematicians, the worst way to convert 
voters’ preferences into an election outcome.
	
The nominees are selected using a system 
called instant runoff, which has been adopted 
in some municipal and state elections. Out 
of last year’s 281 eligible films, each voter 
selects five nominees in order of preference 
for, say, best picture. All movies without any 
first-place votes are eliminated. The votes for 
those films with the least first-place votes are 
re-assigned until five nominees have enough.
	
One problem with that system is a kind 
of squeaky-wheel phenomenon: A movie 
that is second place on every ballot will lose 
out to one that ranks first on only 20% of 
ballots but is hated by everyone else. Then, 
in another upside-down outcome, a movie 
can win for best picture even if 79% of 
voters hated it so long as they split their 
votes evenly among the losing films. This 
isn’t as unfamiliar as it sounds: Some people 
think Al Gore would have won the Electoral 
College in 2000 if Ralph Nader hadn’t 
diverted more votes from him than he took 
from former President George W. Bush.
	
“It’s crazy,” says Michel Balinski, profes-
sor of research at École Polytechnique in 
Palaiseau, France. The nomination system’s 
properties are “truly perverse and antitheti-
cal to the idea of democracy,” says Steven 
Brams, professor of politics at New York 
University. He thinks the final vote for the 
Oscar winner may be even worse than the 
selection of nominees.
	
The big problem: If voting systems them-
selves were put to a vote, prominent schol-
ars would each produce a different ballot, 
then disagree about which system should be 
used to select the winner. So it’s no surprise 
that advocates of alternate voting systems, 
which range from simple yes/no approval 
ratings to assigning numerical scores to 
each candidate, have had little more luck 
reforming political elections than they have 
with entertainment awards.
	
Consider two systems that, on the sur-
face, seem similar. Prof. Balinski and math-
ematician Rida Laraki have devised a system 
they call majority judgment that requires 
voters to rank each candidate on a scale 
from 1 to 6. The votes are lined up in order, 
and each candidate is assigned the middle, 
or median, score. The highest median score 
wins. Another system, range voting, isn’t 
that different: The candidate with the high-
est average, or mean, score wins.
	
Yet the second system’s leading advo-
cate, Temple University mathematician 
Warren D. Smith, has devoted a Web page 
to the Balinksi-Laraki system’s “numerous 
disadvantages.”
	
Brace yourselves for “Ishtar” defeating 
“The Godfather.” Suppose 49 voters award 
“The Godfather” six points and “Ishtar” 
only four. One voter grants the desert 
debacle four points and the mafia master-
piece three, and the remaining 49 award 
“The Godfather” three points and “Ishtar” 
only one point. “Ishtar” actually wins with 
a median score of four points compared 
to “The Godfather’s” three points. Prof. 
Balinski, in turn, calls range voting a “ridicu-
lous method,” because it can be manipu-
lated by strategic voters.
	
Despite the flaws in Oscars voting, the 
system remains as it has since 1936. Every 
15 years or so, the Academy re-examines its 
voting and has decided to stick with it, says 
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences’ executive director, Bruce Davis. “It 
is a very effective method of reflecting the 
will of the entire electorate,” Mr. Davis says.
	
But many voting theorists aren’t so keen 
on the system. It’s called instant runoff 
because it is used in political elections in lieu 
of a two-stage vote in which top candidates

compete again if none receives a majority 
of the vote. Among the potential problems, 
showing up to vote for your favorite candidate 
may create a worse outcome than not 
showing up at all. For example, your vote 
could change the order in which candidates 
are eliminated, and the next-in-line candi-
date on the ballot for the newly eliminated 
film may be a film you loathe.
	
To choose Oscar winners, voters simply 
choose their favorite from the nominees, 
and the contender with the most votes wins. 
That could favor a film that has a devoted 
faction of fans, and sink films with overlap-
ping followings who split their vote. Even 
most critics of instant runoff say it beats 
this plurality system that led to the Gore-
Nader-Bush result. In the film realm, Prof. 
Brams of NYU blames the current system 
for the best-picture victory of “Rocky” over 
films such as “Network” and “Taxi Driver” 
that he speculates would have won head to 
head.
	
How this works out in reality is hard to 
know, because the Academy doesn’t release 
any details about the balloting, even after 
the telecast, in part to avoid shaming fifth-
place films. Mr. Davis says even he never 
learns the numbers from his accountants: 
“Are there years when I’m curious as to 
what the order of finish was? Absolutely. 
But I recognize it as a vulgar curiosity in 
myself.”
	
Such secrecy frustrates voting theorists 
who are anxious for experimental data 
about voter behavior that may help them 
choose from among different voting sys-
tems. Without such evidence, they are left 
to devise their own studies, to dream up 
examples that sink rival systems or to create 
computer simulations to study how easily 
different systems can be manipulated.
	
Sports fans cry manipulation when votes 
don’t go as they’d hoped. Many sports 
awards and rankings are derived from what 
is known as a Borda count, which asks voters 
to rank candidates and then assigns points 
on a sliding scale, with the most for first-
place votes and the least for last-place ones.
	
Critics of these systems fear that stra-
tegic voters will assign their top choice 
the highest possible score, and everyone 
else zero, thereby seizing more power than 
voters who approach the system earnestly; 
or, in the case of rankings, bury or omit a 
preferred candidate’s top rival. Boston Red 
Sox fans will tell you to this day that such 
strategic voting by a New York beat writer 
cost Pedro Martinez the American League 
Most Valuable Player award a decade ago.
	
Says Prof. Balinksi, “Not everyone will 
do it, but enough will do it to manipulate 
the results.”

The Median Voter Is King
Despite Arrow’s theorem, voting is how most societies choose their leaders and 
public policies, often by majority rule. The next step in studying government is 
to examine how governments run by majority rule work. That is, in a democratic 
society, who determines what policy is chosen? In some cases, the theory of demo-
cratic government yields a surprisingly simple answer. 
Let’s consider an example. Imagine that society is deciding how much money 
to spend on some public good, such as the army or the national parks. Each voter 
has his own most preferred budget, and he always prefers outcomes closer to his 
most preferred value to outcomes farther away. Thus, we can line up voters from 
those who prefer the smallest budget to those who prefer the largest. Figure 1 
is an example. Here there are 100 voters, and the budget size varies from zero to 
$20 billion. Given these preferences, what outcome would you expect democracy 
to produce?
According to a famous result called the median voter theorem, majority rule 
will produce the outcome most preferred by the median voter. The median voter is 
the voter exactly in the middle of the distribution. In this example, if you take the 
line of voters ordered by their preferred budgets and count 50 voters from either 
end of the line, you will find that the median voter wants a budget of $10 billion. 
By contrast, the average preferred outcome (calculated by adding the preferred 
outcomes and dividing by the number of voters) is $9 billion, and the modal out-
come (the one preferred by the greatest number of voters) is $15 billion.
The median voter rules the day because his preferred outcome beats any other 
proposal in a two-way race. In our example, more than half the voters want $10 
billion or more, and more than half want $10 billion or less. If someone proposes, 
say, $8 billion instead of $10 billion, everyone who prefers $10 billion or more will 
vote with the median voter. Similarly, if someone proposes $12 billion instead 
of $10 billion, everyone who wants $10 billion or less will vote with the median 
voter. In either case, the median voter has more than half the voters on his side.

CHAPTER 22    Frontiers of Microeconomics
What about the Condorcet voting paradox? It turns out that when the voters 
are picking a point along a line and each voter aims for his own most preferred 
point, the Condorcet paradox cannot arise. The median voter’s most preferred 
outcome beats all challengers.
One implication of the median voter theorem is that if two political parties 
are each trying to maximize their chance of election, they will both move their 
positions toward the median voter. Suppose, for example, that the Democratic 
Party advocates a budget of $15 billion, while the Republican Party advocates a 
budget of $10 billion. The Democratic position is more popular in the sense that 
$15 billion has more proponents than any other single choice. Nonetheless, the 
Republicans get more than 50 percent of the vote: They will attract the 20 voters 
who want $10 billion, the 15 voters who want $5 billion, and the 25 voters who 
want zero. If the Democrats want to win, they will move their platform toward 
the median voter. Thus, this theory can explain why the parties in a two-party 
system are similar to each other: They are both moving toward the median voter.
Another implication of the median voter theorem is that minority views are not 
given much weight. Imagine that 40 percent of the population want a lot of money 
spent on the national parks, and 60 percent want nothing spent. In this case, the 
median voter’s preference is zero, regardless of the intensity of the minority’s 
view. Such is the logic of democracy. Rather than reaching a compromise that 
takes into account everyone’s preferences, majority rule looks only to the person 
in the exact middle of the distribution.
Politicians Are People Too
When economists study consumer behavior, they assume that consumers buy the 
bundle of goods and services that gives them the greatest level of satisfaction. 
When economists study firm behavior, they assume that firms produce the quan-
tity of goods and services that yields the greatest level of profits. What should 
they assume when they study people involved in the practice of politics?
Politicians also have objectives. It would be nice to assume that political lead-
ers are always looking out for the well-being of society as a whole, that they are 
aiming for an optimal combination of efficiency and equality. Nice, perhaps, but 
not realistic. Self-interest is as powerful a motive for political actors as it is for con-
sumers and firm owners. Some politicians, motivated by a desire for reelection, 
are willing to sacrifice the national interest to solidify their base of voters. Others 
are motivated by simple greed. If you have any doubt, you should look at the 
world’s poor nations, where corruption among government officials is a common 
impediment to economic development.
This book is not the place to develop a theory of political behavior. But 
when thinking about economic policy, remember that this policy is made not 
by a benevolent king but by real people with their own all-too-human desires. 
Sometimes they are motivated to further the national interest, but sometimes they 
are motivated by their own political and financial ambitions. We shouldn’t be 
surprised when economic policy fails to resemble the ideals derived in economics 
textbooks.

Behavioral Economics 
Economics is a study of human behavior, but it is not the only field that can make 
that claim. The social science of psychology also sheds light on the choices that 
people make in their lives. The fields of economics and psychology usually pro-
ceed independently, in part because they address a different range of questions. 
But recently, a field called behavioral economics has emerged in which econo-
mists are making use of basic psychological insights. Let’s consider some of these 
insights here.
People Aren’t Always Rational
Economic theory is populated by a particular species of organism, sometimes 
called Homo economicus. Members of this species are always rational. As firm 
managers, they maximize profits. As consumers, they maximize utility (or equiva-
lently, pick the point on the highest indifference curve). Given the constraints they 
face, they rationally weigh all the costs and benefits and always choose the best 
possible course of action.
Real people, however, are Homo sapiens. Although in many ways they resemble 
the rational, calculating people assumed in economic theory, they are far more 
complex. They can be forgetful, impulsive, confused, emotional, and shortsighted. 
These imperfections of human reasoning are the bread and butter of psycholo-
gists, but until recently, economists have neglected them.
Herbert Simon, one of the first social scientists to work at the boundary of eco-
nomics and psychology, suggested that humans should be viewed not as rational 
maximizers but as satisficers. Rather than always choosing the best course of 
action, they make decisions that are merely good enough. Similarly, other econo-
mists have suggested that humans are only “near rational” or that they exhibit 
“bounded rationality.”
Studies of human decision making have tried to detect systematic mistakes that 
people make. Here are a few of the findings:
• 	 People are overconfident. Imagine that you were asked some numerical 
questions, such as the number of African countries in the United Nations, 
the height of the tallest mountain in North America, and so on. Instead 
of being asked for a single estimate, however, you were asked to give a 
90 percent confidence interval—a range such that you were 90 percent 
confident the true number falls within it. When psychologists run 
experiments like this, they find that most people give ranges that are too 
small: The true number falls within their intervals far less than 90 percent of 
the time. That is, most people are too sure of their own abilities.
• 	 People give too much weight to a small number of vivid observations. Imagine that 
you are thinking about buying a car of brand X. To learn about its reliability, 
you read Consumer Reports, which has surveyed 1,000 owners of car X. Then 
you run into a friend who owns car X, and she tells you that her car is a 
lemon. How do you treat your friend’s observation? If you think rationally, 
you will realize that she has only increased your sample size from 1,000 to 
1,001, which does not provide much new information. But because your 
friend’s story is so vivid, you may be tempted to give it more weight in your 
decision making than you should.

CHAPTER 22    Frontiers of Microeconomics
• 	 People are reluctant to change their minds. People tend to interpret evidence to 
confirm beliefs they already hold. In one study, subjects were asked to read 
and evaluate a research report on whether capital punishment deters crime. 
After reading the report, those who initially favored the death penalty said 
they were surer in their view, and those who initially opposed the death 
penalty also said they were surer in their view. The two groups interpreted 
the same evidence in exactly opposite ways.
Think about decisions you have made in your own life. Do you exhibit some of 
these traits?
A hotly debated issue is whether deviations from rationality are important for 
understanding economic phenomena. An intriguing example arises in the study 
of 401(k) plans, the tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts that some firms 
offer their workers. In some firms, workers can choose to participate in the plan 
by filling out a simple form. In other firms, workers are automatically enrolled 
and can opt out of the plan by filling out a simple form. It turns out many more 
workers participate in the second case than in the first. If workers were perfectly 
rational maximizers, they would choose the optimal amount of retirement sav-
ing, regardless of the default offered by their employer. In fact, workers’ behavior 
appears to exhibit substantial inertia. Understanding their behavior seems easier 
once we abandon the model of rational man.
Why, you might ask, is economics built on the rationality assumption when 
psychology and common sense cast doubt on it? One answer is that the assump-
tion, even if not exactly true, may be true enough that it yields reasonably accu-
rate models of behavior. For example, when we studied the differences between 
competitive and monopoly firms, the assumption that firms rationally maximize 
profit yielded many important and valid insights. Incorporating complex psy-
chological deviations from rationality into the story might have added realism, 
but it also would have muddied the waters and made those insights harder to 
find. Recall from Chapter 2 that economic models are not meant to replicate 
reality but are supposed to show the essence of the problem at hand as an aid to 
understanding.
Another reason economists so often assume rationality may be that economists 
are themselves not rational maximizers. Like most people, they are overconfident, 
and they are reluctant to change their minds. Their choice among alternative 
theories of human behavior may exhibit excessive inertia. Moreover, economists 
may be content with a theory that is not perfect but is good enough. The model of 
rational man may be the theory of choice for a satisficing social scientist.
People Care about Fairness 
Another insight about human behavior is best illustrated with an experiment 
called the ultimatum game. The game works like this: Two volunteers (who are 
otherwise strangers to each other) are told that they are going to play a game and 
could win a total of $100. Before they play, they learn the rules. The game begins 
with a coin toss, which is used to assign the volunteers to the roles of player A 
and player B. Player A’s job is to propose a division of the $100 prize between 
himself and the other player. After player A makes his proposal, player B decides 
whether to accept or reject it. If he accepts it, both players are paid according to the 
proposal. If player B rejects the proposal, both players walk away with nothing. In 
either case, the game then ends.

Before proceeding, stop and think about what you would do in this situation. 
If you were player A, what division of the $100 would you propose? If you were 
player B, what proposals would you accept?
Conventional economic theory assumes in this situation that people are 
rational wealth-maximizers. This assumption leads to a simple prediction: Player 
A should propose that he gets $99 and player B gets $1, and player B should 
accept the proposal. After all, once the proposal is made, player B is better off 
accepting it as long as he gets something out of it. Moreover, because player A 
knows that accepting the proposal is in player B’s interest, player A has no reason 
to offer him more than $1. In the language of game theory (discussed in Chapter 17), 
the 99-1 split is the Nash equilibrium.
Yet when experimental economists ask real people to play the ultimatum game, 
the results differ from this prediction. People in player B’s role usually reject 
Can a Soda Tax 
Protect Us from 
Ourselves?
By N. Gregory Mankiw
A
s governments large and small face 
sizable budget shortfalls, policy makers 
are looking for ways to raise tax revenue 
that will do the least harm and, perhaps, 
even a bit of good. One idea keeps popping 
up: a tax on soda and other sugary drinks.
	
The city council in Washington recently 
passed such a tax. Gov. David A. Paterson 
has proposed one for New York. And a 
national soda tax was even briefly consid-
ered by the Senate Finance Committee as 
a way to help pay for President Obama’s 
health care overhaul.
	
But is a soda tax a good idea?
	
Economists have often advocated tax-
ing consumption rather than income, on 
the grounds that consumption taxes do 
less to discourage saving, investment, and 
economic growth. Hence the case for broad-
based consumption taxes, like a value-
added tax. The main issue for the soda 
tax, however, is whether certain forms of 
consumption should be singled out for par-
ticularly high levels of taxation.
	
One argument for specific taxes is that 
consuming certain products has an adverse 
impact on bystanders. Economists call these 
effects negative externalities.
	
Taxes on gasoline can be justified along 
these lines. Whenever you go out for a 
drive, you are to some degree committing 
an antisocial act. You make the roads 
more congested, increasing the commuting 
time of your neighbors. You increase the 
likelihood that other drivers will end up in 
accidents. And the gasoline you burn adds 
to pollution, including the greenhouse gases 
thought to cause global climate change. 
	
Many economists advocate gasoline 
taxes so that drivers will internalize these 
negative externalities. That is, by raising the 
price of gasoline, a tax would induce con-
sumers to take into account the harm they 
cause after making their purchases. One 
prominent study added up all the externali-
ties associated with driving and concluded 
that the optimal gasoline tax is over $2 a 
gallon, about five times the current level 
(combining the federal and a typical state’s 
levies) and about the tax rate in many 
European countries.
	
Applying that logic to other consumer 
goods, however, is not as straightforward. 
Consider cigarettes. They are among the 
most heavily taxed products in the economy, 
as governments have tried to discourage 
 Sin Taxes
If people are inconsistent over time, as behavioral economists contend, 
perhaps tax policy should try to address the problem.

proposals that give them only $1 or a similarly small amount. Anticipating this, 
people in the role of player A usually propose giving player B much more than $1. 
Some people will offer a 50-50 split, but it is more common for player A to propose 
giving player B an amount such as $30 or $40, keeping the larger share for himself. 
In this case, player B usually accepts the proposal.
What’s going on here? The natural interpretation is that people are driven in 
part by some innate sense of fairness. A 99-1 split seems so wildly unfair to many 
people that they reject it, even to their own detriment. By contrast, a 70-30 split is 
still unfair, but it is not so unfair that it induces people to abandon their normal 
self-interest.
Throughout our study of household and firm behavior, the innate sense of fair-
ness has not played any role. But the results of the ultimatum game suggest that 
people from smoking. Yet the case for such 
a policy cannot rely on a conventional exter-
nality argument. 
	
When a person sits at home and smokes 
two packs a day, the main adverse impact 
is on his or her own health. And even if 
second-hand smoke is a concern, that 
problem is most naturally addressed within 
the household, not at the state or federal 
level.
	
Sometimes, advocates of “sin” taxes 
contend that consumers of certain products 
impose adverse budgetary externalities on 
the rest of us—that if the consumption 
induces, say, smoking- or obesity-related 
illness, it raises the cost of health care, 
which we all pay for through higher taxes or 
insurance premiums.
	
Yet this argument also has a flip side: 
If consumers of these products die earlier, 
they will also collect less in pension pay-
ments, including Social Security. Economists 
have run the numbers for smoking and often 
find that these savings may more than offset 
the budgetary costs. In other words, there is 
little net financial impact of smokers on the 
rest of us.
	
It may seem grisly to consider the bud-
getary savings of an early death as a “ben-
efit” to society. But when analyzing policy, 
economists are nothing if not cold-blooded. 
If one uses budgetary costs to justify taxing 
particular consumption goods, the account-
ing needs to be honest and complete. 
	
There is, however, an altogether differ-
ent argument for these taxes: that when 
someone consumes such goods, he does 
impose a negative externality—on the 
future version of himself. In other words, the 
person today enjoys the consumption, but 
the person tomorrow and every day after 
pays the price of increased risk of illness. 
	
This raises an intriguing question: To 
what extent should we view the future ver-
sions of ourselves as different people from 
ourselves today?
	
To be sure, most parents have no trouble 
restricting a child’s decisions on the grounds 
that doing so is in the young person’s 
best interest. Few teenagers are farsighted 
enough to fully incorporate the interests of 
their future selves when making decisions. 
As parents, we hope that someday our 
grown-up children will be grateful for our 
current restrictions on their behavior.
	
But people do not suddenly mature 
at the age of 18, when society deems 
us “adults.” There is always an adoles-
cent lurking inside us, feeling the pull of 
instant gratification and too easily ignor-
ing the long-run effects of our decisions. 
Taxes on items with short-run benefits and 
long-run costs tell our current selves to 
take into account the welfare of our future 
selves.
	
If this is indeed the best argument for 
“sin” taxes, as I believe it is, we are led to 
vexing questions of political philosophy: To 
what extent should we use the power of the 
state to protect us from ourselves? If we go 
down that route, where do we stop?
	
Taxing soda may encourage better nutri-
tion and benefit our future selves. But so 
could taxing candy, ice cream, and fried 
foods. Subsidizing broccoli, gym member-
ships, and dental floss comes next. Taxing 
mindless television shows and subsidizing 
serious literature cannot be far behind.
	
Even as adults, we sometimes wish for 
parents to be looking over our shoulders 
and guiding us to the right decisions. The 
question is, do you trust the government 
enough to appoint it your guardian?

perhaps it should. For example, in Chapters 18 and 19, we discussed how wages 
were determined by labor supply and labor demand. Some economists have sug-
gested that the perceived fairness of what a firm pays its workers should also 
enter the picture. Thus, when a firm has an especially profitable year, workers 
(like player B) may expect to be paid a fair share of the prize, even if the standard 
equilibrium does not dictate it. The firm (like player A) might well decide to give 
workers more than the equilibrium wage for fear that the workers might other-
wise try to punish the firm with reduced effort, strikes, or even vandalism.
People Are Inconsistent over Time
Imagine some dreary task, such as doing your laundry, shoveling snow off your 
driveway, or filling out your income tax forms. Now consider the following 
questions:
	 1.	 Would you prefer (A) to spend 50 minutes doing the task right now or (B) to 
spend 60 minutes doing the task tomorrow?
	 2.	 Would you prefer (A) to spend 50 minutes doing the task in 90 days or (B) 
to spend 60 minutes doing the task in 91 days?
When asked questions like these, many people choose B to question 1 and A to 
question 2. When looking ahead to the future (as in question 2), they minimize the 
amount of time spent on the dreary task. But faced with the prospect of doing the 
task immediately (as in question 1), they choose to put it off.
In some ways, this behavior is not surprising: Everyone procrastinates from 
time to time. But from the standpoint of the theory of rational man, it is puzzling. 
Suppose that, in response to question 2, a person chooses to spend 50 minutes in 
90 days. Then, when the 90th day arrives, we allow him to change his mind. In 
effect, he then faces question 1, so he opts for doing the task the next day. But why 
should the mere passage of time affect the choices he makes?
Many times in life, people make plans for themselves, but then they fail to fol-
low through. A smoker promises himself that he will quit, but within a few hours 
of smoking his last cigarette, he craves another and breaks his promise. A person 
trying to lose weight promises that he will stop eating dessert, but when the 
waiter brings the dessert cart, the promise is forgotten. In both cases, the desire for 
instant gratification induces the decision maker to abandon his past plans.
Some economists believe that the consumption-saving decision is an important 
instance in which people exhibit this inconsistency over time. For many people, 
spending provides a type of instant gratification. Saving, like passing up the ciga-
rette or the dessert, requires a sacrifice in the present for a reward in the distant 
future. And just as many smokers wish they could quit and many overweight 
individuals wish they ate less, many consumers wish they saved more of their 
income. According to one survey, 76 percent of Americans said they were not 
saving enough for retirement.
An implication of this inconsistency over time is that people should try to find 
ways to commit their future selves to following through on their plans. A smoker 
trying to quit may throw away his cigarettes, and a person on a diet may put a 
lock on the refrigerator. What can a person who saves too little do? He should find 
some way to lock up his money before he spends it. Some retirement accounts, 
such as 401(k) plans, do exactly that. A worker can agree to have some money 
taken out of his paycheck before he ever sees it. The money is deposited in an

account that can be used before retirement only with a penalty. Perhaps that is one 
reason these retirement accounts are so popular: They protect people from their 
own desires for instant gratification.
Quick Quiz  Describe at least three ways in which human decision making differs 
from that of the rational individual of conventional economic theory. 
Conclusion
This chapter has examined the frontier of microeconomics. You may have noticed 
that we have sketched out ideas rather than fully developing them. This is no acci-
dent. One reason is that you might study these topics in more detail in advanced 
courses. Another reason is that these topics remain active areas of research and, 
therefore, are still being fleshed out.
To see how these topics fit into the broader picture, recall the Ten Principles of 
Economics from Chapter 1. One principle states that markets are usually a good 
way to organize economic activity. Another principle states that governments 
can sometimes improve market outcomes. As you study economics, you can 
more fully appreciate the truth of these principles as well as the caveats that go 
with them. The study of asymmetric information should make you more wary of 
market outcomes. The study of political economy should make you more wary of 
government solutions. And the study of behavioral economics should make you 
wary of any institution that relies on human decision making, including both the 
market and the government.
If there is a unifying theme to these topics, it is that life is messy. Information 
is imperfect, government is imperfect, and people are imperfect. Of course, you 
knew this long before you started studying economics, but economists need to 
understand these imperfections as precisely as they can if they are to explain, and 
perhaps even improve, the world around them.
Summary
• In many economic transactions, information is 
asymmetric. When there are hidden actions, 
principals may be concerned that agents suffer 
from the problem of moral hazard. When there 
are hidden characteristics, buyers may be con-
cerned about the problem of adverse selection 
among the sellers. Private markets sometimes 
deal with asymmetric information with signaling 
and screening. 
• Although government policy can sometimes 
improve market outcomes, governments are 
themselves imperfect institutions. The Condorcet 
paradox shows that majority rule fails to pro-
duce transitive preferences for society, and 
Arrow’s impossibility theorem shows that no 
voting system will be perfect. In many situa-
tions, democratic institutions will produce the 
outcome desired by the median voter, regardless 
of the preferences of the rest of the electorate. 
Moreover, the individuals who set government 
policy may be motivated by self-interest rather 
than the national interest.
• The study of psychology and economics reveals 
that human decision making is more complex 
than is assumed in conventional economic the-
ory. People are not always rational, they care 
about the fairness of economic outcomes (even 
to their own detriment), and they can be incon-
sistent over time.

Key Concepts
Questions for Review
	 1.	 What is moral hazard? List three things an 
employer might do to reduce the severity of this 
problem.
	 2.	 What is adverse selection? Give an example of 
a market in which adverse selection might be a 
problem.
	 3.	 Define signaling and screening and give an 
example of each.
	 4.	 What unusual property of voting did Condorcet 
notice?
	 5.	 Explain why majority rule respects the 
preferences of the median voter rather than the 
average voter.
	 6.	 Describe the ultimatum game. What outcome 
from this game would conventional economic 
theory predict? Do experiments confirm this 
prediction? Explain.
Problems and Applications
	 1.	 Each of the following situations involves moral 
hazard. In each case, identify the principal and 
the agent, and explain why there is asymmetric 
information. How does the action described 
reduce the problem of moral hazard?
a.	 Landlords require tenants to pay security 
deposits.
b.	Firms compensate top executives with 
options to buy company stock at a given 
price in the future.
c.	 Car insurance companies offer discounts to 
customers who install antitheft devices in 
their cars.
	 2.	 Suppose that the Live-Long-and-Prosper 
Health Insurance Company charges $5,000 
annually for a family insurance policy. The 
company’s president suggests that the company 
raise the annual price to $6,000 to increase its 
profits. If the firm followed this suggestion, 
what economic problem might arise? Would 
the firm’s pool of customers tend to become 
more or less healthy on average? Would the 
company’s profits necessarily increase?
	 3.	 A case study in this chapter describes how a 
boyfriend can signal to a girlfriend that he loves 
her by giving an appropriate gift. Do you think 
saying “I love you” can also serve as a signal? 
Why or why not?
	 4.	 Some AIDS activists believe that health 
insurance companies should not be allowed to 
ask applicants if they are infected with the HIV 
virus that causes AIDS. Would this rule help or 
hurt those who are HIV-positive? Would it help 
or hurt those who are not HIV-positive? Would 
it exacerbate or mitigate the problem of adverse 
selection in the market for health insurance? 
Do you think it would increase or decrease the 
number of people without health insurance? 
In your opinion, would this be a good policy? 
Explain your answers to each question.
	 5.	 The government is considering two ways to 
help the needy: giving them cash or giving them 
free meals at soup kitchens. Give an argument 
for giving cash. Give an argument, based on 
asymmetric information, for why the soup 
kitchen may be better than the cash handout.

day triathlon. They have a running race on day 
one, a swimming race on day two, and a biking 
race on day three. You know the order in which 
the eligible contestants finish each of the three 
components. From this information, you are 
asked to rank them in the overall competition. 
You are given the following conditions:
• The ordering of athletes should be transitive: 
If athlete A is ranked above athlete B, and 
athlete B is ranked above athlete C, then 
athlete A must rank above athlete C.
• If athlete A beats athlete B in all three races, 
athlete A should rank higher than athlete B.
• The rank ordering of any two athletes 
should not depend on whether a third 
athlete drops out of the competition just 
before the final ranking.

According to Arrow’s impossibility theorem, 
there are only three ways to rank the athletes 
that satisfy these properties. What are they? 
Are these desirable? Why or why not? Can you 
think of a better ranking scheme? Which of the 
three properties above does your scheme not 
satisfy?
	11.	 Two ice-cream stands are deciding where to 
set up along a 1-mile beach. The people are 
uniformly located along the beach, and each 
person sitting on the beach buys exactly 1 ice-
cream cone per day from the nearest stand. 
Each ice-cream seller wants the maximum 
number of customers. Where along the beach 
will the two stands locate?  Of which result in 
this chapter does this outcome remind you?
	12.	 Explain why the following reactions might 
reflect some deviation from rationality.
a.	 After a widely reported earthquake in 
California, many people call their insurance 
company to apply for earthquake insurance. 
b. In January, many fitness clubs offer special 
annual membership fees to attract customers 
who have made New Year’s resolutions to 
exercise more. Even when these memberships 
are costly, many of these new customers 
seldom visit the gym to work out.
