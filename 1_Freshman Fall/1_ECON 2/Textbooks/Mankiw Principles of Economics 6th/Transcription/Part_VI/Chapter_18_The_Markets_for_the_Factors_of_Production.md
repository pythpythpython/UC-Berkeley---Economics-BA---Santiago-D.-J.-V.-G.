hen you finish school, your income will be determined largely by 
what kind of job you take. If you become a computer programmer, 
you will earn more than if you become a gas station attendant. This 
fact is not surprising, but it is not obvious why it is true. No law 
requires that computer programmers be paid more than gas station attendants. 
No ethical principle says that programmers are more deserving. What then deter-
mines which job will pay you the higher wage?
Your income, of course, is a small piece of a larger economic picture. In 2010, the 
total income of all U.S. residents was about $15 trillion. People earned this income 
in various ways. Workers earned about three-fourths of it in the form of wages 
and fringe benefits. The rest went to landowners and to the owners of capital—the 
economy’s stock of equipment and structures—in the form of rent, profit, and 
interest. What determines how much goes to workers? To landowners? To the 
owners of capital? Why do some workers earn higher wages than others, some

landowners higher rental income than others, and some capital owners greater 
profit than others? Why, in particular, do computer programmers earn more than 
gas station attendants?
The answers to these questions, like most in economics, hinge on supply and 
demand. The supply and demand for labor, land, and capital determine the prices 
paid to workers, landowners, and capital owners. To understand why some peo-
ple have higher incomes than others, therefore, we need to look more deeply at 
the markets for the services they provide. That is our job in this and the next two 
chapters.
This chapter provides the basic theory for the analysis of factor markets. As 
you may recall from Chapter 2, the factors of production are the inputs used to 
produce goods and services. Labor, land, and capital are the three most important 
factors of production. When a computer firm produces a new software program, it 
uses programmers’ time (labor), the physical space on which its offices are located 
(land), and an office building and computer equipment (capital). Similarly, when 
a gas station sells gas, it uses attendants’ time (labor), the physical space (land), 
and the gas tanks and pumps (capital). 
In many ways factor markets resemble the markets for goods and services we 
analyzed in previous chapters, but they are different in one important way: The 
demand for a factor of production is a derived demand. That is, a firm’s demand 
for a factor of production is derived from its decision to supply a good in another 
market. The demand for computer programmers is inseparably linked to the sup-
ply of computer software, and the demand for gas station attendants is insepara-
bly linked to the supply of gasoline. 
In this chapter, we analyze factor demand by considering how a competitive, 
profit-maximizing firm decides how much of any factor to buy. We begin our 
analysis by examining the demand for labor. Labor is the most important factor 
of production, because workers receive most of the total income earned in the U.S. 
economy. Later in the chapter, we will see that our analysis of the labor market 
also applies to the markets for the other factors of production.
The basic theory of factor markets developed in this chapter takes a large step 
toward explaining how the income of the U.S. economy is distributed among 
workers, landowners, and owners of capital. Chapter 19 builds on this analysis 
to examine in more detail why some workers earn more than others. Chapter 
20 examines how much income inequality results from the functioning of factor 
markets and then considers what role the government should and does play in 
altering the income distribution.
The Demand for Labor
Labor markets, like other markets in the economy, are governed by the forces of 
supply and demand. This is illustrated in Figure 1. In panel (a), the supply and 
demand for apples determine the price of apples. In panel (b), the supply and 
demand for apple pickers determine the price, or wage, of apple pickers.
As we have already noted, labor markets are different from most other markets 
because labor demand is a derived demand. Most labor services, rather than being 
final goods ready to be enjoyed by consumers, are inputs into the production of 
other goods. To understand labor demand, we need to focus on the firms that 
hire the labor and use it to produce goods for sale. By examining the link between 
the production of goods and the demand for labor to make those goods, we gain 
insight into the determination of equilibrium wages.

CHAPTER 18    The Markets for the Factors of Production
The Competitive Profit-Maximizing Firm
 Let’s look at how a typical firm, such as an apple producer, decides what quantity 
of labor to demand. The firm owns an apple orchard and each week must decide 
how many apple pickers to hire to harvest its crop. After the firm makes its hir-
ing decision, the workers pick as many apples as they can. The firm then sells the 
apples, pays the workers, and keeps what is left as profit.
We make two assumptions about our firm. First, we assume that our firm is 
competitive both in the market for apples (where the firm is a seller) and in the 
market for apple pickers (where the firm is a buyer). A competitive firm is a price 
taker. Because there are many other firms selling apples and hiring apple pick-
ers, a single firm has little influence over the price it gets for apples or the wage 
it pays apple pickers. The firm takes the price and the wage as given by market 
conditions. It only has to decide how many apples to sell and how many workers 
to hire.
Second, we assume that the firm is profit maximizing. Thus, the firm does not 
directly care about the number of workers it has or the number of apples it pro-
duces. It cares only about profit, which equals the total revenue from the sale of 
apples minus the total cost of producing them. The firm’s supply of apples and 
its demand for workers are derived from its primary goal of maximizing profit.
The Production Function and the  
Marginal Product of Labor
 To make its hiring decision, the firm must consider how the size of its work-
force affects the amount of output produced. In other words, it must consider 
how the number of apple pickers affects the quantity of apples it can harvest

and sell. Table 1 gives a numerical example. In the first column is the number 
of workers. In the second column is the quantity of apples the workers harvest 
each week.
These two columns of numbers describe the firm’s ability to produce. Recall 
that economists use the term production function to describe the relationship 
between the quantity of the inputs used in production and the quantity of out-
put from production. Here the “input” is the apple pickers and the “output” is 
the apples. The other inputs—the trees themselves, the land, the firm’s trucks 
and tractors, and so on—are held fixed for now. This firm’s production function 
shows that if the firm hires 1 worker, that worker will pick 100 bushels of apples 
per week. If the firm hires 2 workers, the 2 workers together will pick 180 bushels 
per week. And so on.
Figure 2 graphs the data on labor and output presented in Table 1. The number 
of workers is on the horizontal axis, and the amount of output is on the vertical 
axis. This figure illustrates the production function.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics introduced in Chapter 1 is that rational 
people think at the margin. This idea is the key to understanding how firms 
decide what quantity of labor to hire. To take a step toward this decision, the third 
column in Table 1 gives the marginal product of labor, the increase in the amount 
of output from an additional unit of labor. When the firm increases the number of 
workers from 1 to 2, for example, the amount of apples produced rises from 100 to 
180 bushels. Therefore, the marginal product of the second worker is 80 bushels.
Notice that as the number of workers increases, the marginal product of labor 
declines. That is, the production process exhibits diminishing marginal product. 
At first, when only a few workers are hired, they can pick the low-hanging fruit. 
As the number of workers increases, additional workers have to climb higher up 
the ladders to find apples to pick. Hence, as more and more workers are hired, 
each additional worker contributes less to the production of apples. For this rea-
son, the production function in Figure 2 becomes flatter as the number of workers 
rises.

CHAPTER 18    The Markets for the Factors of Production
The Value of the Marginal Product and  
the Demand for Labor
Our profit-maximizing firm is concerned more with money than with apples. As 
a result, when deciding how many workers to hire to pick apples, the firm consid-
ers how much profit each worker would bring in. Because profit is total revenue 
minus total cost, the profit from an additional worker is the worker’s contribution 
to revenue minus the worker’s wage.
To find the worker’s contribution to revenue, we must convert the marginal 
product of labor (which is measured in bushels of apples) into the value of the 
marginal product (which is measured in dollars). We do this using the price of 
apples. To continue our example, if a bushel of apples sells for $10 and if an addi-
tional worker produces 80 bushels of apples, then the worker produces $800 of 
revenue.
The value of the marginal product of any input is the marginal product of 
that input multiplied by the market price of the output. The fourth column in 
Table 1 shows the value of the marginal product of labor in our example, assum-
ing the price of apples is $10 per bushel. Because the market price is constant 
for a competitive firm while the marginal product declines with more workers, 
the value of the marginal product diminishes as the number of workers rises. 
Economists sometimes call this column of numbers the firm’s marginal revenue 
product: It is the extra revenue the firm gets from hiring an additional unit of a 
factor of production.
Now consider how many workers the firm will hire. Suppose that the market 
wage for apple pickers is $500 per week. In this case, as you can see in Table 1, 
the first worker that the firm hires is profitable: The first worker yields $1,000 in 
revenue, or $500 in profit. Similarly, the second worker yields $800 in additional 
revenue, or $300 in profit. The third worker produces $600 in additional revenue,

The Production Function
The production function is 
the relationship between the 
inputs into production (apple 
pickers) and the output 
from production (apples). 
As the quantity of the input 
increases, the production 
function gets flatter, 
reflecting the property 
of diminishing marginal 
product.

or $100 in profit. After the third worker, however, hiring workers is unprofitable. 
The fourth worker would yield only $400 of additional revenue. Because the 
worker’s wage is $500, hiring the fourth worker would mean a $100 reduction in 
profit. Thus, the firm hires only 3 workers.
It is instructive to consider the firm’s decision graphically. Figure 3 graphs the 
value of the marginal product. This curve slopes downward because the mar-
ginal product of labor diminishes as the number of workers rises. The figure also 
includes a horizontal line at the market wage. To maximize profit, the firm hires 
workers up to the point where these two curves cross. Below this level of employ-
ment, the value of the marginal product exceeds the wage, so hiring another 
worker would increase profit. Above this level of employment, the value of the 
marginal product is less than the wage, so the marginal worker is unprofitable. 
Thus, a competitive, profit-maximizing firm hires workers up to the point where the value 
of the marginal product of labor equals the wage.
Having explained the profit-maximizing hiring strategy for a competitive firm, 
we can now offer a theory of labor demand. Recall that a firm’s labor-demand 
curve tells us the quantity of labor that a firm demands at any given wage. We 
have just seen in Figure 3 that the firm makes that decision by choosing the quan-
tity of labor at which the value of the marginal product equals the wage. As a 
result, the value-of-marginal-product curve is the labor-demand curve for a competitive, 
profit-maximizing firm.
What Causes the Labor-Demand Curve to Shift?
 We now understand the labor-demand curve: It reflects the value of the marginal 
product of labor. With this insight in mind, let’s consider a few of the things that 
might cause the labor-demand curve to shift.
The Output Price  The value of the marginal product is marginal product times 
the price of the firm’s output. Thus, when the output price changes, the value of 
the marginal product changes, and the labor-demand curve shifts. An increase in

This figure shows how the 
value of the marginal product 
(the marginal product times 
the price of the output) 
depends on the number of 
workers. The curve slopes 
downward because of 
diminishing marginal product. 
For a competitive, profit-
maximizing firm, this value- 
of-marginal-product curve is 
also the firm’s labor-demand 
curve.

CHAPTER 18    The Markets for the Factors of Production
the price of apples, for instance, raises the value of the marginal product of each 
worker who picks apples and, therefore, increases labor demand from the firms 
that supply apples. Conversely, a decrease in the price of apples reduces the value 
of the marginal product and decreases labor demand. 
Technological Change  Between 1960 and 2009, the output a typical U.S. 
worker produced in an hour rose by 183 percent. Why? The most important rea-
son is technological progress: Scientists and engineers are constantly figuring out 
new and better ways of doing things. This has profound implications for the labor 
market. Technological advance typically raises the marginal product of labor, 
which in turn increases the demand for labor and shifts the labor-demand curve 
to the right. 
It is also possible for technological change to reduce labor demand. The inven-
tion of a cheap industrial robot, for instance, could conceivably reduce the mar-
ginal product of labor, shifting the labor-demand curve to the left. Economists 
call this labor-saving technological change. History suggests, however, that most 
FYI
 Input Demand and Output Supply: 
Two Sides of the Same Coin
I
n Chapter 14, we saw how a competitive, profit-maximizing firm 
decides how much of its output to sell: It chooses the quantity of 
output at which the price of the good equals the marginal cost of 
production. We have just seen how such a firm decides how much 
labor to hire: It chooses the quantity of labor at which the wage 
equals the value of the marginal product. Because the production 
function links the quantity of inputs to the quantity of output, you 
should not be surprised to learn that the firm’s decision about input 
demand is closely linked to its decision about output supply. In fact, 
these two decisions are two sides of the same coin.
	
To see this relationship more fully, let’s consider how the marginal 
product of labor (MPL) and marginal cost (MC) are related. Suppose 
an additional worker costs $500 and has a marginal product of 50 
bushels of apples. In this case, producing 50 more bushels costs 
$500; the marginal cost of a bushel is $500/50, or $10. More gener-
ally, if W is the wage, and an extra unit of labor produces MPL units 
of output, then the marginal cost of a unit of output is MC = W/MPL.
	
This analysis shows that diminishing marginal product is closely 
related to increasing marginal cost. When our apple orchard grows 
crowded with workers, each additional worker adds less to the 
production of apples (MPL falls). Similarly, when the apple firm is 
producing a large quantity of apples, the orchard is already crowded 
with workers, so it is more costly to produce an additional bushel of 
apples (MC rises). 
	
Now consider our criterion for profit maximization. We deter-
mined earlier that a profit-maximizing firm chooses the quantity of 
labor so that the value of the marginal product (P × MPL ) equals 
the wage (W). We can write this mathematically as
P × MPL = W.
If we divide both sides of this equation by MPL, we obtain
P = W/MPL.
We just noted that W/MPL equals marginal cost, MC. Therefore, we 
can substitute to obtain
P = MC.
This equation states that the price of the firm’s output is equal 
to the marginal cost of producing a unit of output. Thus, when a 
competitive firm hires labor up to the point at which the value of 
the marginal product equals the wage, it also produces up to the 
point at which the price equals marginal cost. Our analysis of labor 
demand in this chapter is just another way of looking at the produc-
tion decision we first saw in Chapter 14.

technological progress is instead labor-augmenting. Such technological advance 
explains persistently rising employment in the face of rising wages: Even though 
wages (adjusted for inflation) increased by 150 percent during the last half 
century, firms nonetheless increased the amount of labor they employed by 
87 percent.
The Supply of Other Factors  The quantity available of one factor of produc-
tion can affect the marginal product of other factors. A fall in the supply of lad-
ders, for instance, will reduce the marginal product of apple pickers and thus the 
demand for apple pickers. We consider this linkage among the factors of produc-
tion more fully later in the chapter.

 The Luddite Revolt
O
ver the long span of history, technological progress has been 
the worker’s friend. It has increased productivity, labor demand, 
and wages. Yet there is no doubt that workers sometimes see tech-
nological progress as a threat to their standard of living.
	
One famous example occurred in England in the early 19th cen-
tury, when skilled knitters saw their jobs threatened by the invention 
and spread of machines that could produce textiles using less skilled 
workers and at much lower cost. The displaced workers organized 
violent revolts against the new technology. They smashed the 
weaving machines used in the wool and cotton mills and, in some 
cases, set the homes of the mill owners on fire. Because the workers 
claimed to be led by General Ned Ludd (who may have been a leg-
endary figure rather than a real person), they were called Luddites. 
	
The Luddites wanted the British government to save their jobs by 
restricting the spread of the new technology. Instead, the Parliament 
took action to stop the Luddites. Thousands of troops were sent 
to suppress the Luddite riots, and the Parliament eventually made 
destroying machines a capital crime. After a trial in York in 1813, 
seventeen men were hanged for the offense. Many others were 
convicted and sent to Australia as prisoners.
	
Today, the term Luddite refers to anyone who opposes techno-
logical progress.

CHAPTER 18    The Markets for the Factors of Production
The Supply of Labor
Having analyzed labor demand in detail, let’s turn to the other side of the mar-
ket and consider labor supply. A formal model of labor supply is included in 
Chapter 21, where we develop the theory of household decision making. Here we 
discuss briefly and informally the decisions that lie behind the labor-supply curve.
The Trade-off between Work and Leisure
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that people face trade-offs. 
Probably no trade-off is more obvious or more important in a person’s life than the 
trade-off between work and leisure. The more hours you spend working, the fewer 
hours you have to watch TV, enjoy dinner with friends, or pursue your favorite 
hobby. The trade-off between labor and leisure lies behind the labor-supply curve.
Another of the Ten Principles of Economics is that the cost of something is what 
you give up to get it. What do you give up to get an hour of leisure? You give up 
an hour of work, which in turn means an hour of wages. Thus, if your wage is $15 
per hour, the opportunity cost of an hour of leisure is $15. And when you get a 
raise to $20 per hour, the opportunity cost of enjoying leisure goes up.
The labor-supply curve reflects how workers’ decisions about the labor-leisure 
trade-off respond to a change in that opportunity cost. An upward-sloping labor-
supply curve means that an increase in the wage induces workers to increase the 
quantity of labor they supply. Because time is limited, more hours of work mean 
that workers are enjoying less leisure. That is, workers respond to the increase in 
the opportunity cost of leisure by taking less of it.
It is worth noting that the labor-supply curve need not be upward sloping. 
Imagine you got that raise from $15 to $20 per hour. The opportunity cost of 
leisure is now greater, but you are also richer than you were before. You might 
decide that with your extra wealth you can now afford to enjoy more leisure. That 
is, at the higher wage, you might choose to work fewer hours. If so, your labor-
supply curve would slope backward. In Chapter 21, we discuss this possibility in 
terms of conflicting effects on your labor-supply decision (called the income and 
substitution effects). For now, we ignore the possibility of backward-sloping labor 
supply and assume that the labor-supply curve is upward sloping.
What Causes the Labor-Supply Curve to Shift?
The labor-supply curve shifts whenever people change the amount they want to 
work at a given wage. Let’s now consider some of the events that might cause 
such a shift.
Changes in Tastes  In 1950, 34 percent of women were employed at paid jobs 
or looking for work. In 2009, the number had risen to 59 percent. There are many 
explanations for this development, but one of them is changing tastes, or attitudes 
toward work. A generation or two ago, it was the norm for women to stay at home 
and raise children. Today, family sizes are smaller, and more mothers choose to 
work. The result is an increase in the supply of labor.
Changes in Alternative Opportunities  The supply of labor in any one 
labor market depends on the opportunities available in other labor markets. If the 
wage earned by pear pickers suddenly rises, some apple pickers may choose to 
switch occupations, and the supply of labor in the market for apple pickers falls.

working five days a week, 
fifty weeks a year for forty 
years, but I needed the 
money.”

The Economics of Labor Markets
Immigration  Movement of workers from region to region, or country to 
country, is another important source of shifts in labor supply. When immigrants 
come to the United States, for instance, the supply of labor in the United States 
increases, and the supply of labor in the immigrants’ home countries falls. In fact, 
much of the policy debate about immigration centers on its effect on labor supply 
and, thereby, equilibrium wages in the labor market.
Quick Quiz  Who has a greater opportunity cost of enjoying leisure—a janitor or 
a brain surgeon? Explain. Can this help explain why doctors work such long hours?
Equilibrium in the Labor Market
So far we have established two facts about how wages are determined in competi-
tive labor markets:
• 	 The wage adjusts to balance the supply and demand for labor. 
• 	 The wage equals the value of the marginal product of labor. 
At first, it might seem surprising that the wage can do both of these things at once. 
In fact, there is no real puzzle here, but understanding why there is no puzzle is 
an important step to understanding wage determination.
Figure 4 shows the labor market in equilibrium. The wage and the quan-
tity of labor have adjusted to balance supply and demand. When the market 
is in this equilibrium, each firm has bought as much labor as it finds profit-
able at the equilibrium wage. That is, each firm has followed the rule for profit 
Figure 4
Equilibrium in a Labor 
Market
Like all prices, the price of 
labor (the wage) depends on 
supply and demand. Because 
the demand curve reflects 
the value of the marginal 
product of labor, in equilibrium 
workers receive the value of 
their marginal contribution to 
the production of goods and 
services.

maximization: It has hired workers until the value of the marginal product equals 
the wage. Hence, the wage must equal the value of the marginal product of labor 
once it has brought supply and demand into equilibrium. 
This brings us to an important lesson: Any event that changes the supply or demand 
for labor must change the equilibrium wage and the value of the marginal product by the 
same amount because these must always be equal. To see how this works, let’s consider 
some events that shift these curves. 
Shifts in Labor Supply
Suppose that immigration increases the number of workers willing to pick apples. 
As Figure 5 shows, the supply of labor shifts to the right from S1 to S2. At the initial 
wage W1, the quantity of labor supplied now exceeds the quantity demanded. This 
surplus of labor puts downward pressure on the wage of apple pickers, and the fall 
in the wage from W1 to W2 in turn makes it profitable for firms to hire more work-
ers. As the number of workers employed in each apple orchard rises, the marginal 
product of a worker falls, and so does the value of the marginal product. In the 
new equilibrium, both the wage and the value of the marginal product of labor are 
lower than they were before the influx of new workers.
An episode from Israel illustrates how a shift in labor supply can alter the 
equilibrium in a labor market. During most of the 1980s, many thousands of 
Palestinians regularly commuted from their homes in the Israeli-occupied West 
Bank and Gaza Strip to jobs in Israel, primarily in the construction and agricul-
ture industries. In 1988, however, political unrest in these occupied areas induced 
the Israeli government to take steps that, as a by-product, reduced this supply of 
workers. Curfews were imposed, work permits were checked more thoroughly, 
and a ban on overnight stays of Palestinians in Israel was enforced more rigor-
ously. The economic impact of these steps was exactly as theory predicts: The 
A Shift in Labor Supply
When labor supply increases 
from S1 to S2, perhaps 
because of an immigration 
of new workers, the 
equilibrium wage falls from 
W1 to W2. At this lower 
wage, firms hire more labor, 
so employment rises from 
L1 to L2. The change in the 
wage reflects a change in 
the value of the marginal 
product of labor: With more 
workers, the added output 
from an extra worker is 
smaller.

number of Palestinians with jobs in Israel fell by half, while those who continued 
to work in Israel enjoyed wage increases of about 50 percent. With a reduced 
number of Palestinian workers in Israel, the value of the marginal product of the 
remaining workers was much higher.
Shifts in Labor Demand
Now suppose that an increase in the popularity of apples causes their price to rise. 
This price increase does not change the marginal product of labor for any given 
number of workers, but it does raise the value of the marginal product. With a higher 
price for apples, hiring more apple pickers is now profitable. As Figure 6 (page 388) 
shows, when the demand for labor shifts to the right from D1 to D2, the equilibrium 
wage rises from W1 to W2, and equilibrium employment rises from L1 to L2. Once 
again, the wage and the value of the marginal product of labor move together.
This analysis shows that prosperity for firms in an industry is often linked to 
prosperity for workers in that industry. When the price of apples rises, apple pro-
ducers make greater profit, and apple pickers earn higher wages. When the price 
of apples falls, apple producers earn smaller profit, and apple pickers earn lower 
Q: What can you tell us about the size of the 
immigrant population in the United States?
	
A: Immigrants make up about 12.5 
percent of the overall population, which means 
about 38 million foreign-born live in the United 
States. The commonly accepted estimate for 
the undocumented portion of the foreign-born 
population is 11–12 million. Immigrants come 
from all parts of the world, but we’ve seen 
big changes in their origins. In the 1950s 
and 1960s, 75 percent of immigrants were 
from Europe. Today, about 80 percent are 
from Latin America and Asia. Inflows are also 
much larger today, with 1 million to 2 million 
newcomers entering each year.
	
What’s interesting about the United 
States is how our economy has been able 
to absorb immigrants and put them to 
work. U.S. immigrants have high employ-
ment rates compared with other developed 
countries. This is partly because we don’t set 
high entry-level wages or have strict hiring 
and firing rules. In this type of flexible sys-
tem, you have more job openings. You have 
more opportunities. You also have lower 
entry-level wages, but immigrants at least 
get their foot in the door.
	
Being in the workforce allows immi-
grants to interact with the rest of society. 
They learn the language faster, pay taxes 
and become stakeholders.
	
Q: Where do immigrants fit into the U.S. 
economy?
	
A: Our immigrants are diverse in eco-
nomic terms. We rely on immigrants for 
both high- and low-skilled jobs. Some 
immigrants do medium-skilled work, but 
more than anything else they’re found on

the low and the high ends of the education 
distribution. 
	
The economic effects are different 
depending on which group you’re talking 
about. We have an extremely important group 
of high-skilled immigrants. We rely on them 
to fill important, high-level jobs in technology, 
science and research. About 40 percent of our 
Ph.D. scientists and engineers were born in 
another country. We also employ many high-
skilled immigrants in the health sector.
	
High-skilled immigration has good eco-
nomic effects—it adds to GDP growth. It 
also has beneficial fiscal effects—the impact 
on government finances is large and positive. 
People tend to focus on illegal or low-skilled 
immigration when discussing immigrants 
and often do not recognize the tremendous 
contribution of high-skilled immigrants.
	
Q: What about the low-skilled immigration?
	
A: With low-skilled immigration, the 
economic benefits are there as well but have 
to be balanced against the fiscal impact, 
which is likely negative.
	
What makes the fiscal issue more difficult 
is the distribution of the burden. The federal 
government reaps much of the revenue from 
immigrants who work and pay employment 
taxes. State and local governments realize 
less of that benefit and have to pay more 
of the costs associated with low-skilled 
immigration—usually health care and edu-
cational expenses.
	
Q: Does it matter whether the immigra-
tion is legal or not?
	
A: If you’re making value judgments 
about immigrants, or if you’re discussing 
national security, you probably need to distin-
guish between those who come legally and 
those who don’t. From an economic perspec-
tive, however, it makes more sense to dif-
ferentiate among immigrants of various skill 
levels than it does to focus on legal status.
	
The economic benefits of low-skilled 
immigrants aren’t typically going to depend 
on how they entered the United States. 
Illegal immigrants may pay less in taxes, 
but they’re also eligible for fewer benefits. 
So being illegal doesn’t mean these immi-
grants have a worse fiscal impact. In fact, 
a low-skilled illegal immigrant can create 
less fiscal burden than a low-skilled legal 
immigrant because the undocumented 
don’t qualify for most benefits.
	
Q: How does immigration affect jobs and 
earnings for the native-born population?
	
A: We focus a lot on that—for example, 
exactly how immigration has affected the 
wages of Americans, particularly the low-
skilled who lack a high school degree. The 
reason we worry about this is that real 
wages have been falling for low-skilled U.S. 
workers over the past 25 years or so.
	
The studies tend to show that not much 
of the decline is due to inflows of immigrants. 
The consensus seems to be that wages are 
about 1 to 3 percent lower today as a result 
of immigration. Some scholars find larger 
effects for low-skilled workers. Still, labor 
economists think it’s a bit of a puzzle that 
they haven’t been able to systematically 
identify larger adverse wage effects.
	
The reason may be the way the economy 
is constantly adjusting to the inflow of 
immigrants. On a geographical basis, for 
example, a large influx of immigrants into 
an area tends to encourage an inflow of 
capital to put them to use. So you have a 
shift out in labor supply, but you also have 
a shift out in labor demand, and the wage 
effects are ameliorated.

wages. This lesson is well known to workers in industries with highly volatile 
prices. Workers in oil fields, for instance, know from experience that their earn-
ings are closely linked to the world price of crude oil.
From these examples, you should now have a good understanding of how 
wages are set in competitive labor markets. Labor supply and labor demand 
together determine the equilibrium wage, and shifts in the supply or demand 
curve for labor cause the equilibrium wage to change. At the same time, profit 
maximization by the firms that demand labor ensures that the equilibrium wage 
always equals the value of the marginal product of labor.
Productivity and Wages
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that our standard of liv-
ing depends on our ability to produce goods and services. We can now see how 
this principle works in the market for labor. In particular, our analysis of labor 
demand shows that wages equal productivity as measured by the value of the

marginal product of labor. Put simply, highly productive workers are highly paid, 
and less productive workers are less highly paid.
This lesson is key to understanding why workers today are better off than 
workers in previous generations. Table 2 presents some data on growth in pro-
ductivity and growth in real wages (that is, wages adjusted for inflation). From 
1959 to 2009, productivity as measured by output per hour of work grew about 
2.1 percent per year. Real wages grew at 1.9 percent—almost exactly the same 
rate. With a growth rate of 2 percent per year, productivity and real wages double 
about every 35 years.
Productivity growth varies over time. Table 2 also shows the data for three 
shorter periods that economists have identified as having very different pro-
ductivity experiences. Around 1973, the U.S. economy experienced a significant 
slowdown in productivity growth that lasted until 1995. The cause of the produc-
tivity slowdown is not well understood, but the link between productivity and 
real wages is exactly as standard theory predicts. The slowdown in productivity 
growth from 2.8 to 1.4 percent per year coincided with a slowdown in real wage 
growth from 2.8 to 1.2 percent per year. 
Productivity growth picked up again around 1995, and many observers hailed 
the arrival of the “new economy.” This productivity acceleration is most often 
attributed to the spread of computers and information technology. As theory 
predicts, growth in real wages picked up as well. From 1995 to 2009, productivity 
grew by 2.6 percent per year, and real wages grew by 2.3 percent per year.
The bottom line: Both theory and history confirm the close connection between 
productivity and real wages.  ■

CHAPTER 18    The Markets for the Factors of Production
The Other Factors of Production: Land and Capital
We have seen how firms decide how much labor to hire and how these decisions 
determine workers’ wages. At the same time that firms are hiring workers, they 
are also deciding about other inputs to production. For example, our apple-
producing firm might have to choose the size of its apple orchard and the number 
of ladders for its apple pickers. We can think of the firm’s factors of production as 
falling into three categories: labor, land, and capital.
FYI
 Monopsony
O
n the preceding pages, we built our analysis of the labor market 
with the tools of supply and demand. In doing so, we assumed 
that the labor market was competitive. That is, we assumed that 
there were many buyers and sellers of labor, so each buyer or seller 
had a negligible effect on the wage.
	
Yet imagine the labor market in a small town dominated by a 
single, large employer. That employer can exert a large influence on 
the going wage, and it may well use that market power to alter the 
outcome. Such a market in which there is a single buyer is called a 
monopsony.
	
A monopsony (a market with one buyer) is in many ways similar 
to a monopoly (a market with one seller). Recall from Chapter 15 
that a monopoly firm produces less of the good than would a com-
petitive firm; by reducing the quantity offered for sale, the monopoly 
firm moves along the product’s demand curve, raising the price 
and also its profits. Similarly, a monopsony firm in a labor market 
hires fewer workers than would a competitive firm; by reducing the 
number of jobs available, the monopsony firm moves along the labor 
supply curve, reducing the wage it pays and raising its profits. Thus, 
both monopolists and monopsonists reduce economic activity in a 
market below the socially optimal level. In both cases, the existence 
of market power distorts the outcome and causes deadweight 
losses. 
	
This book does not present the formal model of monopsony 
because, in the world, monopsonies are rare. In most labor markets, 
workers have many possible employers, and firms compete with one 
another to attract workers. In this case, the model of supply and 
demand is the best one to use.

The Economics of Labor Markets
The meaning of the terms labor and land is clear, but the definition of capital is 
somewhat tricky. Economists use the term capital to refer to the stock of equip-
ment and structures used for production. That is, the economy’s capital represents 
the accumulation of goods produced in the past that are being used in the present 
to produce new goods and services. For our apple firm, the capital stock includes 
the ladders used to climb the trees, the trucks used to transport the apples, the 
buildings used to store the apples, and even the trees themselves.
Equilibrium in the Markets for Land and Capital 
What determines how much the owners of land and capital earn for their contri-
bution to the production process? Before answering this question, we need to dis-
tinguish between two prices: the purchase price and the rental price. The purchase 
price of land or capital is the price a person pays to own that factor of production 
indefinitely. The rental price is the price a person pays to use that factor for a 
limited period of time. It is important to keep this distinction in mind because, as 
we will see, these prices are determined by somewhat different economic forces. 
Having defined these terms, we can now apply the theory of factor demand that 
we developed for the labor market to the markets for land and capital. Because the 
wage is the rental price of labor, much of what we have learned about wage deter-
mination applies also to the rental prices of land and capital. As Figure 7 illustrates, 
the rental price of land, shown in panel (a), and the rental price of capital, shown 
in panel (b), are determined by supply and demand. Moreover, the demand for 
land and capital is determined just like the demand for labor. That is, when our 
apple-producing firm is deciding how much land and how many ladders to rent, 
it follows the same logic as when deciding how many workers to hire. For both

Supply and demand determine the compensation paid to the owners of land, as 
shown in panel (a), and the compensation paid to the owners of capital, as shown in 
panel (b). The demand for each factor, in turn, depends on the value of the marginal 
product of that factor.

CHAPTER 18    The Markets for the Factors of Production
land and capital, the firm increases the quantity hired until the value of the fac-
tor’s marginal product equals the factor’s price. Thus, the demand curve for each 
factor reflects the marginal productivity of that factor. 
We can now explain how much income goes to labor, how much goes to land-
owners, and how much goes to the owners of capital. As long as the firms using the 
factors of production are competitive and profit-maximizing, each factor’s rental 
price must equal the value of the marginal product for that factor. Labor, land, and 
capital each earn the value of their marginal contribution to the production process.
Now consider the purchase price of land and capital. The rental price and the 
purchase price are related: Buyers are willing to pay more for a piece of land or 
capital if it produces a valuable stream of rental income. And as we have just seen, 
the equilibrium rental income at any point in time equals the value of that factor’s 
marginal product. Therefore, the equilibrium purchase price of a piece of land or 
capital depends on both the current value of the marginal product and the value 
of the marginal product expected to prevail in the future.
Linkages among the Factors of Production
We have seen that the price paid to any factor of production—labor, land, or 
capital—equals the value of the marginal product of that factor. The marginal 
FYI
 What Is Capital Income?
L
abor income is an easy concept to understand: It is the paycheck 
that workers get from their employers. The income earned by 
capital, however, is less obvious.
	
In our analysis, we have been implicitly assuming that house-
holds own the economy’s stock of capital—ladders, drill presses, 
warehouses, and so on—and rent it to the firms that use it. Capital 
income, in this case, is the rent that households receive for the use 
of their capital. This assumption simplified our analysis of how capi-
tal owners are compensated, but it is not entirely realistic. In fact, 
firms usually own the capital they use, and therefore, they receive 
the earnings from this capital.
	
These earnings from capital, however, eventually are paid to 
households. Some of the earnings are paid in the form of interest to 
those households who have lent money to firms. Bondholders and 
bank depositors are two examples of recipients of interest. Thus, 
when you receive interest on your bank account, that income is part 
of the economy’s capital income.
	
In addition, some of the earnings from capital are paid to house-
holds in the form of dividends. Dividends are payments by a firm to 
the firm’s stockholders. A stockholder is a person who has bought a 
share in the ownership of the firm and, therefore, is entitled to share 
in the firm’s profits.
	
A firm does not have to pay out all its earnings to households 
in the form of interest and dividends. Instead, it can retain some 
earnings within the firm and use these earnings to buy additional 
capital. Although these retained earnings are not paid to the firm’s 
stockholders, the stockholders benefit from them nonetheless. 
Because retained earnings increase the amount of capital the firm 
owns, they tend to increase future earnings and, thereby, the value 
of the firm’s stock. 
	
These institutional details are interesting and important, but they 
do not alter our conclusion about the income earned by the owners 
of capital. Capital is paid according to the value of its marginal prod-
uct, regardless of whether this income is transmitted to households 
in the form of interest or dividends or whether it is kept within firms 
as retained earnings.

The Economics of Labor Markets
product of any factor, in turn, depends on the quantity of that factor that is avail-
able. Because of diminishing marginal product, a factor in abundant supply has 
a low marginal product and thus a low price, and a factor in scarce supply has a 
high marginal product and a high price. As a result, when the supply of a factor 
falls, its equilibrium factor price rises. 
When the supply of any factor changes, however, the effects are not limited 
to the market for that factor. In most situations, factors of production are used 
together in a way that makes the productivity of each factor dependent on the 
quantities of the other factors available for use in the production process. As a 
result, a change in the supply of any one factor alters the earnings of all the factors.
For example, suppose a hurricane destroys many of the ladders that workers 
use to pick apples from the orchards. What happens to the earnings of the vari-
ous factors of production? Most obviously, the supply of ladders falls, and there-
fore, the equilibrium rental price of ladders rises. Those owners who were lucky 
enough to avoid damage to their ladders now earn a higher return when they rent 
out their ladders to the firms that produce apples. 
Yet the effects of this event do not stop at the ladder market. Because there 
are fewer ladders with which to work, the workers who pick apples have a 
smaller marginal product. Thus, the reduction in the supply of ladders reduces 
the demand for the labor of apple pickers, and this causes the equilibrium wage 
to fall. 
This story shows a general lesson: An event that changes the supply of any fac-
tor of production can alter the earnings of all the factors. The change in earnings 
of any factor can be found by analyzing the impact of the event on the value of 
the marginal product of that factor.
The Economics of the Black Death 
In 14th‑century Europe, the bubonic plague wiped out about one‑third of the popula-
tion within a few years. This event, called the Black Death, provides a grisly natural 
experiment to test the theory of factor markets that we have just developed. Consider 
the effects of the Black Death on those who were lucky enough to survive. What do you 
think happened to the wages earned by workers and the rents earned by landowners?
	
To answer this question, let’s examine the effects of a reduced population on the 
marginal product of labor and the marginal product of land. With a smaller supply 
of workers, the marginal product of labor rises. (This is diminishing marginal prod-
uct working in reverse.) Thus, we would expect the Black Death to raise wages.
	
Because land and labor are used together in production, a smaller supply of 
workers also affects the market for land, the other major factor of production in 
medieval Europe. With fewer workers available to farm the land, an additional 
unit of land produced less additional output. In other words, the marginal prod-
uct of land fell. Thus, we would expect the Black Death to lower rents.
	
In fact, both predictions are consistent with the historical evidence. Wages 
approximately doubled during this period, and rents declined 50 percent or more. 
The Black Death led to economic prosperity for the peasant classes and reduced 
incomes for the landed classes.  ■

CHAPTER 18    The Markets for the Factors of Production
Conclusion
This chapter explained how labor, land, and capital are compensated for the 
roles they play in the production process. The theory developed here is called the 
neoclassical theory of distribution. According to the neoclassical theory, the amount 
paid to each factor of production depends on the supply and demand for that 
factor. The demand, in turn, depends on that particular factor’s marginal produc-
tivity. In equilibrium, each factor of production earns the value of its marginal 
contribution to the production of goods and services.
The neoclassical theory of distribution is widely accepted. Most economists 
begin with the neoclassical theory when trying to explain how the U.S. economy’s 
$15 trillion of income is distributed among the economy’s various members. In the 
following two chapters, we consider the distribution of income in more detail. As 
you will see, the neoclassical theory provides the framework for this discussion.
Even at this point, you can use the theory to answer the question that began this 
chapter: Why are computer programmers paid more than gas station attendants? 
It is because programmers can produce a good of greater market value than can 
gas station attendants. People are willing to pay dearly for a good computer game, 
but they are willing to pay little to have their gas pumped and their windshield 
washed. The wages of these workers reflect the market prices of the goods they 
produce. If people suddenly got tired of using computers and decided to spend 
more time driving, the prices of these goods would change, and so would the 
equilibrium wages of these two groups of workers. 
Summary
• The economy’s income is distributed in the mar-
kets for the factors of production. The three most 
important factors of production are labor, land, 
and capital.
• The demand for factors, such as labor, is a 
derived demand that comes from firms that 
use the factors to produce goods and services. 
Competitive, profit-maximizing firms hire each 
factor up to the point at which the value of the 
marginal product of the factor equals its price.
• The supply of labor arises from individuals’ 
trade-off between work and leisure. An upward-
sloping labor-supply curve means that people 
respond to an increase in the wage by working 
more hours and enjoying less leisure. 
• The price paid to each factor adjusts to balance the 
supply and demand for that factor. Because factor 
demand reflects the value of the marginal product 
of that factor, in equilibrium each factor is com-
pensated according to its marginal contribution to 
the production of goods and services.
• Because factors of production are used together, 
the marginal product of any one factor depends 
on the quantities of all factors that are available. 
As a result, a change in the supply of one factor 
alters the equilibrium earnings of all the factors.

CHAPTER 18    The Markets for the Factors of Production
c.	 Calculate the marginal product and the value 
of the marginal product for each additional 
robot.
d.	How many robots should the firm rent? 
Explain.
	 5.	 The nation of Ectenia has 20 competitive apple 
orchards, which sell apples at the world price  
of $2. The following equations describe the  
production function and the marginal product 
of labor in each orchard:
	
Q = 100L – L2.
	
MPL = 100 – 2L
where Q is the number of apples produced in a 
day, L is the number of workers, and MPL is the 
marginal product of labor.
a.	 What is each orchard’s labor demand as a 
function of the daily wage W? What is the 
market’s labor demand?
b.	Ectenia has 200 workers who supply their 
labor inelastically. Solve for the wage W. 
How many workers does each orchard hire? 
How much profit does each orchard owner 
make?
c.	 Calculate what happens to the income of 
workers and orchard owners if the world 
price of apples doubles to $4.
d.	Now suppose the price of apples is back 
at $2, but a hurricane destroys half the 
orchards. Calculate how the hurricane 
affects the income of each worker and of 
each remaining orchard owner. What  
happens to the income of Ectenia as a 
whole?
	 6.	 Your enterprising uncle opens a sandwich shop 
that employs 7 people. The employees are paid 
$6 per hour, and a sandwich sells for $3. If your 
uncle is maximizing his profit, what is the value 
of the marginal product of the last worker he 
hired? What is that worker’s marginal product?
	 7.	 Suppose a freeze destroys part of the Florida 
orange crop. 
a.	 Explain what happens to the price of oranges 
and the marginal product of orange pickers 
as a result of the freeze. Can you say what 
happens to the demand for orange pickers? 
Why or why not?
b.	Suppose the price of oranges doubles and the 
marginal product falls by 30 percent. What 
happens to the equilibrium wage of orange 
pickers?
c.	 Suppose the price of oranges rises by  
30 percent and the marginal product falls by 
50 percent. What happens to the equilibrium 
wage of orange pickers?
	 8.	 Leadbelly Co. sells pencils in a perfectly  
competitive product market and hires workers in 
a perfectly competitive labor market. Assume that 
the market wage rate for workers is $150 per day.
a. 	What rule should Leadbelly follow to hire the 
profit-maximizing amount of labor?
b. 	At the profit-maximizing level of output, the 
marginal product of the last worker hired 
is 30 boxes of pencils per day. Calculate the 
price of a box of pencils.
c. 	Draw a diagram of the labor market for  
pencil workers (as in Figure 4 of this chapter) 
next to a diagram of the labor supply and 
demand for Leadbelly Co. (as in Figure 3). 
Label the equilibrium wage and quantity of 
labor for both the market and the firm. How 
are these diagrams related?
d. 	Suppose some pencil workers switch to jobs in 
the growing computer industry. On the  
side-by-side diagrams from part (c), show how 
this change affects the equilibrium wage and 
quantity of labor for both the pencil market 
and for Leadbelly. How does this change affect 
the marginal product of labor at Leadbelly?
	 9. 	During the 1980s, 1990s, and the first decade of 
the 20th century, the United States experienced 
a significant inflow of capital from abroad. For 
example, Toyota, BMW, and other foreign car 
companies built auto plants in the United States.
a.	 Using a diagram of the U.S. capital market, 
show the effect of this inflow on the rental 
price of capital in the United States and on 
the quantity of capital in use.
b.	Using a diagram of the U.S. labor market, 
show the effect of the capital inflow on the 
average wage paid to U.S. workers.
	10.	 In recent years, some policymakers have  
proposed requiring firms to give workers certain 
fringe benefits, such as health insurance. Let’s 
consider the effects of such a policy on the labor 
market.
a.	 Suppose that a law required firms to give 
each worker $3 of fringe benefits for every 
hour that the worker is employed by the 
firm. How does this law affect the marginal 
profit that a firm earns from each worker? 
How does the law affect the demand curve

for labor? Draw your answer on a graph with 
the cash wage on the vertical axis.
b.	If there is no change in labor supply, how 
would this law affect employment and  
wages?
c.	 Why might the labor-supply curve shift in 
response to this law? Would this shift in 
labor supply raise or lower the impact of the 
law on wages and employment?
d.	As Chapter 6 discussed, the wages of some 
workers, particularly the unskilled and  
inexperienced, are kept above the equilibrium 
level by minimum-wage laws. What effect 
would a fringe-benefit mandate have for 
these workers? 
	11. 	This chapter has assumed that labor is supplied 
by individual workers acting competitively. In 
some markets, however, the supply of labor is 
determined by a union of workers.
a.	 Explain why the situation faced by a labor 
union may resemble the situation faced by a 
monopoly firm.
b.	The goal of a monopoly firm is to maximize 
profits. Is there an analogous goal for labor 
unions? 
c.	 Now extend the analogy between monopoly 
firms and unions. How do you suppose 
that the wage set by a union compares to 
the wage in a competitive market? How do 
you suppose employment differs in the two 
cases?
d.	What other goals might unions have that 
make unions different from monopoly firms?
