Income Inequality

T
he only difference between the rich and other people,” Mary Colum 
once said to Ernest Hemingway, “is that the rich have more money.” 
Maybe so. But this claim leaves many questions unanswered. The gap 
between rich and poor is a fascinating and important topic of study—for 
the comfortable rich, for the struggling poor, and for the aspiring and worried 
middle class. 
From the previous two chapters, you should have some understanding about 
why different people have different incomes. A person’s earnings depend on the 
supply and demand for that person’s labor, which in turn depend on natural 
ability, human capital, compensating differentials, discrimination, and so on. 
Because labor earnings make up about three-fourths of the total income in the 
U.S. economy, the factors that determine wages are also largely responsible for 
determining how the economy’s total income is distributed among the various 
members of society. In other words, they determine who is rich and who is poor.

THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
In this chapter, we discuss the distribution of income—a topic that raises some 
fundamental questions about the role of economic policy. One of the Ten ­Principles 
of Economics in Chapter 1 is that governments can sometimes improve market 
outcomes. This possibility is particularly important when considering the distri-
bution of income. The invisible hand of the marketplace acts to allocate resources 
efficiently, but it does not necessarily ensure that resources are allocated fairly. As 
a result, many economists—though not all—believe that the government should 
redistribute income to achieve greater equality. In doing so, however, the govern-
ment runs into another of the Ten Principles of Economics: People face trade-offs. 
When the government enacts policies to make the distribution of income more 
equal, it distorts incentives, alters behavior, and makes the allocation of resources 
less efficient.
Our discussion of the distribution of income proceeds in three steps. First, we 
assess how much inequality there is in our society. Second, we consider some 
different views about what role the government should play in altering the dis-
tribution of income. Third, we discuss various public policies aimed at helping 
society’s poorest members. 
The Measurement of Inequality
We begin our study of the distribution of income by addressing four questions of 
measurement:
• 	 How much inequality is there in our society? 
• 	 How many people live in poverty? 
• 	 What problems arise in measuring the amount of inequality?
• 	 How often do people move among income classes?
These measurement questions are the natural starting point from which to discuss 
public policies aimed at changing the distribution of income.
U.S. Income Inequality
Imagine that you lined up all the families in the economy according to their 
annual income. Then you divided the families into five equal groups: the bottom 
fifth, the second fifth, the middle fifth, the fourth fifth, and the top fifth. Table 1

shows the income ranges for each of these groups, as well as for the top 5 percent. 
You can use this table to find where your family lies in the income distribution.
For examining differences in the income distribution over time, economists 
find it useful to present the income data as in Table 2. This table shows the share 
of total income that each group of families received in selected years. In 2008, the 
bottom fifth of all families received 4.0 percent of all income, and the top fifth of 
all families received 47.8 percent of all income. In other words, even though the 
top and bottom fifths include the same number of families, the top fifth has about 
twelve times as much income as the bottom fifth.
The last column in the table shows the share of total income received by the 
very richest families. In 2008, the top 5 percent of families received 20.5 percent of 
total income, which was greater than the total income of the poorest 40 percent.
Table 2 also shows the distribution of income in various years beginning in 1935. 
At first glance, the distribution of income appears to have been remarkably stable 
over time. Throughout the past several decades, the bottom fifth of families has 
received about 4 to 5 percent of income, while the top fifth has received about 40 
to 50 percent of income. Closer inspection of the table reveals some trends in the 
degree of inequality. From 1935 to 1970, the distribution gradually became more 
equal. The share of the bottom fifth rose from 4.1 to 5.5 percent, and the share of the 
top fifth fell from 51.7 percent to 40.9 percent. In more recent years, this trend has 
reversed itself. From 1970 to 2008, the share of the bottom fifth fell from 5.5 percent 
to 4.0 percent, and the share of the top fifth rose from 40.9 to 47.8 percent. 
In Chapter 19, we discussed some explanations for this recent rise in inequality. 
Increases in international trade with low-wage countries and changes in technol-
ogy have tended to reduce the demand for unskilled labor and raise the demand 
for skilled labor. As a result, the wages of unskilled workers have fallen relative 
to the wages of skilled workers, and this change in relative wages has increased 
inequality in family incomes.
Inequality around the World
How does the amount of inequality in the United States compare to that in other 
countries? This question is interesting, but answering it is problematic. For some 
countries, data are not available. Even when they are, not every country collects

data in the same way; for example, some countries collect data on individual 
incomes, whereas other countries collect data on family incomes, and still others 
collect data on expenditure rather than income. As a result, whenever we find a 
difference between two countries, we can never be sure whether it reflects a true 
difference in the economies or merely a difference in the way data are collected.
With this warning in mind, consider Figure 1, which compares inequality in 
twelve countries. The inequality measure is the ratio of the income received by 
the richest tenth of the population to the income of the poorest tenth. The most 
equality is found in Japan, where the top tenth receives 4.5 times as much income 
as the bottom tenth. The least equality is found in Brazil, where the top group 
receives 40.6 times as much income as the bottom group. Although all countries 
have significant disparities between rich and poor, the degree of inequality varies 
substantially around the world.
When countries are ranked by inequality, the United States ends up around 
the middle of the pack. The United States has more income inequality than other 
economically advanced countries, such as Japan, Germany, and Canada. But the 
United States has a more equal income distribution than many developing coun-
tries, such as South Africa, Brazil, and Mexico.

CHAPTER 20    Income Inequality and Poverty
The Poverty Rate
A commonly used gauge of the distribution of income is the poverty rate. The 
poverty rate is the percentage of the population whose family income falls below 
an absolute level called the poverty line. The poverty line is set by the federal 
government at roughly three times the cost of providing an adequate diet. This 
line is adjusted every year to account for changes in the level of prices, and it 
depends on family size. 
To get some idea about what the poverty rate tells us, consider the data for 
2008. In that year, the median family had an income of $61,521, and the poverty 
line for a family of four was $22,025. The poverty rate was 13.2 percent. In other 
words, 13.2 percent of the population were members of families with incomes 
below the poverty line for their family size. 
Figure 2 shows the poverty rate since 1959, when the official data begin. 
You can see that the poverty rate fell from 22.4 percent in 1959 to a low of 11.1 
percent in 1973. This decline is not surprising, because average income in the 
economy (adjusted for inflation) rose more than 50 percent during this period. 
Because the poverty line is an absolute rather than a relative standard, more 
families are pushed above the poverty line as economic growth pushes the 
entire income distribution upward. As John F. Kennedy once put it, a rising 
tide lifts all boats.
Since the early 1970s, however, the economy’s rising tide has left some boats 
behind. Despite continued growth in average income, the poverty rate has not 
declined below the level reached in 1973. This lack of progress in reducing pov-
erty in recent decades is closely related to the increasing inequality we saw in 
Table 2. Although economic growth has raised the income of the typical family, 
the increase in inequality has prevented the poorest families from sharing in this 
greater economic prosperity.

THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
Poverty is an economic malady that affects all groups within the population, 
but it does not affect all groups with equal frequency. Table 3 shows the poverty 
rates for several groups, and it reveals three striking facts:
• 	 Poverty is correlated with race. Blacks and Hispanics are about three times 
more likely to live in poverty than are whites.
• 	 Poverty is correlated with age. Children are more likely than average to be 
members of poor families, and the elderly are less likely than average to  
be poor. 
• 	 Poverty is correlated with family composition. Families headed by a female 
adult and without a spouse present are almost six times as likely to live in 
poverty as a family headed by a married couple.
These three facts have described U.S. society for many years, and they show which 
people are most likely to be poor. These effects also work together: Among black 
and Hispanic children in female-headed households, about half live in poverty.
Problems in Measuring Inequality
Although data on the income distribution and the poverty rate help to give us 
some idea about the degree of inequality in our society, interpreting these data is 
not always straightforward. The data are based on households’ annual incomes. 
What people care about, however, is not their incomes but their ability to main-
tain a good standard of living. For at least three reasons, data on the income dis-
tribution and the poverty rate give an incomplete picture of inequality in living 
standards. 
In-Kind Transfers  Measurements of the distribution of income and the pov-
erty rate are based on families’ money income. Through various government 
programs, however, the poor receive many nonmonetary items, including food 
stamps, housing vouchers, and medical services. Transfers to the poor given in 
the form of goods and services rather than cash are called in-kind transfers. 
Standard measurements of the degree of inequality do not take account of these 
in-kind transfers.

CHAPTER 20    Income Inequality and Poverty
Because in-kind transfers are received mostly by the poorest members of 
­society, the failure to include in-kind transfers as part of income greatly affects 
the measured poverty rate. According to a study by the Census Bureau, if in-kind 
transfers were included in income at their market value, the number of families in 
poverty would be about 10 percent lower than the standard data indicate. 
The Economic Life Cycle  Incomes vary predictably over people’s lives. A 
young worker, especially one in school, has a low income. Income rises as the 
worker gains maturity and experience, peaks at around age 50, and then falls 
sharply when the worker retires at around age 65. This regular pattern of income 
variation is called the life cycle.
Because people can borrow and save to smooth out life cycle changes in 
income, their standard of living in any year depends more on lifetime income 
than on that year’s income. The young often borrow, perhaps to go to school or 
to buy a house, and then repay these loans later when their incomes rise. People 
have their highest saving rates when they are middle-aged. Because people can 
save in anticipation of retirement, the large declines in incomes at retirement need 
not lead to similar declines in the standard of living. This normal life cycle pattern 
causes inequality in the distribution of annual income, but it does not necessarily 
represent true inequality in living standards. 
Transitory versus Permanent Income  Incomes vary over people’s lives not 
only because of predictable life cycle variation but also because of random and 
transitory forces. One year a frost kills off the Florida orange crop, and Florida 
orange growers see their incomes fall temporarily. At the same time, the Florida 
frost drives up the price of oranges, and California orange growers see their 
incomes temporarily rise. The next year the reverse might happen.
Just as people can borrow and lend to smooth out life cycle variation in income, 
they can also borrow and lend to smooth out transitory variation in income.To 
the extent that a family saves in good years and borrows (or depletes its savings) 
in bad years, transitory changes in income need not affect its standard of living. 
A family’s ability to buy goods and services depends largely on its permanent 
income, which is its normal, or average, income. 
To gauge inequality of living standards, the distribution of permanent income 
is more relevant than the distribution of annual income. Many economists believe 
that people base their consumption on their permanent income; as a result, ine-
quality in consumption is one gauge of inequality of permanent income. Because 
permanent income and consumption are less affected by transitory changes in 
income, they are more equally distributed than is current income. 
Alternative Measures of Inequality
A 2008 study by Michael Cox and Richard Alm of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Dallas shows how different measures of inequality lead to dramatically differ-
ent results. Cox and Alm compared American households in the top fifth of the 
income distribution to those in the bottom fifth to see how far apart they are.
According to Cox and Alm, the richest fifth of U.S. households in 2006 had 
an average income of $149,963, while the poorest fifth had an average income of 
$9,974. Thus, the top group had about 15 times as much income as the bottom 
group.

How We Measure 
Poverty
By Rebecca M. Blank
W
ho is poor in America? It turns out 
that’s a hard question to answer.
The federal government’s badly out-
dated method of measuring poverty pro-
vides an inaccurate picture. New York found 
the official numbers so useless that the city 
recently developed its own poverty mea-
sure. Other cities, including Los Angeles, are 
considering doing the same thing . . . .
But what’s most needed is an overhaul 
of the nation’s poverty measurement sta-
tistics. The good news is that legislation is 
being drafted in both the House and Senate. 
A change is long overdue. 
Why does it matter if we have a good 
measure of poverty? In the last four decades, 
the U.S. has greatly expanded programs 
for lower-income families, including food 
stamps, housing vouchers, medical care 
assistance, and tax credits. But the poverty 
rate doesn’t take any of these resources 
into account because it doesn’t account 
for taxes or noncash income. At the same 
time, Americans’ medical expenses have 
increased, and more single parents work 
and pay child-care expenses. The current 
poverty measure is unaffected by these 
changes too. 
The result? Poverty statistics that make 
it depressingly easy to claim that public 
spending on the poor has had little effect. 
Indeed, most programs to help the needy 
would never budge the U.S. poverty rate the 
way we measure it now. 
The current measure of poverty was 
established in 1964 by a Social Security 
Administration economist named Mollie 
Orshansky. Looking at data from 1955—
the best available in the early 1960s—she 
found that a family spent, on average, one-
third of its income on food. Hence, three-
times-food became the official poverty line. 
That line has ticked upward only by being 
adjusted for inflation each year. 
No other regularly reported economic 
statistic has been unchanged for four 
decades. Food prices have fallen; today, 
food constitutes less than one-seventh of 
the average family’s budget. But people 
pay substantially more for housing and 
energy.
Still, the old poverty measure continues 
to be used by all sorts of government pro-
grams. Some use it for eligibility limits; most 
families below 130% of the poverty line, for 
instance, are eligible for food stamps. Some 
federal block grants to states are partly 
based on state poverty levels. 
 What’s Wrong with the Poverty Rate?
The author of this article (later appointed by President Obama to be 
Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs) says we need bet-
ter statistics.
in the news
The gap between rich and poor shrinks a bit if taxes are taken into account. 
Because the tax system is progressive, the top group paid a higher percentage of 
its income in taxes than did the bottom group. Cox and Alm found that the richest 
fifth had 14 times as much after-tax income as the poorest fifth.
The gap shrinks more substantially if one looks at consumption rather than 
income. Households having an unusually good year are more likely to be in the 
top group and are likely to save a high fraction out of their incomes. Households 
having an unusually bad year are more likely to be in the bottom group and are 
more likely to consume out of their savings. According to Cox and Alms, the 
consumption of the richest fifth was only 3.9 times as much as the consumption 
of the poorest fifth. 
The consumption gap becomes smaller still if one corrects for differences in 
the number of people in the household. Because larger families are more likely 
to have two earners, they are more likely to find themselves near the top of the 
income distribution. But they also have more mouths to feed. Cox and Alms

CHAPTER 20    Income Inequality and Poverty
In 1995, I participated in a panel 
of scholars at the National Academy of 
Sciences (NAS), a group that advises the 
federal government on scientific issues. We 
recommended a far more effective way 
to establish a poverty threshold, based 
on expenditures for a bundle of necessi-
ties, including food, shelter, clothing and 
utilities. Furthermore, this threshold would 
vary geographically, based on differences in 
housing costs. 
This would mean that families in Los 
Angeles have a different poverty line from 
families in rural Wyoming. When New York 
calculated a new threshold with this meth-
odology, officials found that it was $21,818 
for a family of four, not far from the official 
U.S. figure of $20,444. But when they 
adjusted for New York’s high housing costs, 
it rose to $26,138. 
But the poverty measure also needs to 
recognize that the resources in low-income 
families extend beyond wages and cash 
income. The NAS panel recommended a 
much broader definition, including cash 
income adjusted for tax payments, plus 
the value of government benefits such as 
food stamps or Section 8 rental vouchers. 
Unavoidable costs were subtracted from 
income, as well, because working requires 
spending money on transportation and, 
often, child care. Similarly, out-of-pocket 
medical expenses also were deducted. 
Why weren’t these changes made years 
ago? That’s a story of politics getting in the 
way of good statistics. Back in the 1960s, 
the poverty measure was placed under the 
control of the White House. This is in con-
trast to all of our other national statistics, 
which are defined and updated by agencies 
with a long history of nonpolitical decision 
making. 
Unfortunately, no president (Democrat 
or Republican) has wanted to touch this 
political hot potato. If a new measure shows 
higher poverty, the president looks bad, but 
if a new measure shows lower poverty, he’ll 
be accused of dismissing the problem. 
And the numbers will change. In New 
York, where the official U.S. poverty mea-
sure finds 18% of the city is poor, the new 
measure (largely because of housing costs) 
finds 23%. But the picture will be more 
accurate. New York found rates differed 
little for children but were much higher for 
the elderly because of out-of-pocket medical 
expenditures. 
That’s why Congress needs to pass 
legislation to direct one of the statistical 
agencies to calculate a new federal poverty 
measure, guided by the NAS recommenda-
tions. Under a new measure, single-mother 
families receiving food stamps and in subsi-
dized housing would appear a little better 
off; disabled individuals with high medical 
expenses, a little worse. Families in big 
cities with high housing costs, such as in 
California, would be poorer, and families 
that receive working tax credits less poor. 
But that is just as it should be. If we 
want to debate new policies to help the 
poor, we first need a poverty measure that 
shows us who they really are.

reported that households in the top fifth had an average of 3.1 people, while 
those in the bottom fifth had an average of 1.7 people. As a result, consumption 
per person in the richest fifth of households was only 2.1 times consumption per 
person in the poorest fifth. 
These data show that inequality in material standards of living is much smaller 
than inequality in annual income.  ■
Economic Mobility
People sometimes speak of “the rich” and “the poor” as if these groups consisted 
of the same families year after year. In fact, this is not at all the case. Economic 
mobility, the movement of people among income classes, is substantial in the 
U.S. economy. Movements up the income ladder can be due to good luck or hard 
work, and movements down the ladder can be due to bad luck or laziness. Some 
of this mobility reflects transitory variation in income, while some reflects more 
persistent changes in income.

Because economic mobility is so great, many of those below the poverty line 
are there only temporarily. Poverty is a long-term problem for relatively few fami-
lies. In a typical 10-year period, about one in four families falls below the poverty 
line in at least one year. Yet fewer than 3 percent of families are poor for eight or 
more years. Because it is likely that the temporarily poor and the persistently poor 
face different problems, policies that aim to combat poverty need to distinguish 
between these groups.
Another way to gauge economic mobility is the persistence of economic suc-
cess from generation to generation. Economists who have studied this topic find 
that having an above-average income carries over from parents to children, but 
the persistence is far from perfect, indicating substantial mobility among income 
classes. If a father earns 20 percent above his generation’s average income, his son 
will most likely earn 8 percent above his generation’s average income. There is 
only a small correlation between the income of a grandfather and the income of 
a grandson. 
One result of this great economic mobility is that the U.S. economy is filled with 
self-made millionaires (as well as with heirs who have squandered the fortunes 
they inherited). According to one study, about four out of five millionaires made 
their money on their own, often by starting and building a business or by climb-
ing the corporate ladder. Only one in five millionaires inherited his or her fortune.
QUICK QUIZ  What does the poverty rate measure? • Describe three potential ­problems 
in interpreting the measured poverty rate.
The Political Philosophy of Redistributing Income
We have just seen how the economy’s income is distributed and have considered 
some of the problems in interpreting measured inequality. This discussion was 
positive in the sense that it merely described the world as it is. We now turn to the 
normative question facing policymakers: What should the government do about 
economic inequality?
This question is not just about economics. Economic analysis alone cannot tell 
us whether policymakers should try to make our society more egalitarian. Our 
views on this question are, to a large extent, a matter of political philosophy. 
Yet because the government’s role in redistributing income is central to so many 
debates over economic policy, here we digress from economic science to consider 
a bit of political philosophy.
Utilitarianism
A prominent school of thought in political philosophy is utilitarianism. The 
founders of utilitarianism are the English philosophers Jeremy Bentham (1748–
1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806–1873). To a large extent, the goal of utilitarians is 
to apply the logic of individual decision making to questions concerning morality 
and public policy.
The starting point of utilitarianism is the notion of utility—the level of happi-
ness or satisfaction that a person receives from his or her circumstances. Utility is 
a measure of well-being and, according to utilitarians, is the ultimate objective of 
all public and private actions. The proper goal of the government, they claim, is 
to maximize the sum of utility achieved by everyone in society.

CHAPTER 20    Income Inequality and Poverty
The utilitarian case for redistributing income is based on the assumption of 
diminishing marginal utility. It seems reasonable that an extra dollar of income 
provides a poor person with more additional utility than an extra dollar would 
provide to a rich person. In other words, as a person’s income rises, the extra well-
being derived from an additional dollar of income falls. This plausible assump-
tion, together with the utilitarian goal of maximizing total utility, implies that the 
government should try to achieve a more equal distribution of income.
The argument is simple. Imagine that Peter and Paul are the same, except 
that Peter earns $80,000 and Paul earns $20,000. In this case, taking a dollar from 
Peter to pay Paul will reduce Peter’s utility and raise Paul’s utility. But because of 
diminishing marginal utility, Peter’s utility falls by less than Paul’s utility rises. 
Thus, this redistribution of income raises total utility, which is the utilitarian’s 
objective.
At first, this utilitarian argument might seem to imply that the government 
should continue to redistribute income until everyone in society has exactly the same 
income. Indeed, that would be the case if the total amount of income—$100,000 in 
our example—were fixed. But in fact, it is not. Utilitarians reject complete equaliza-
tion of incomes because they accept one of the Ten Principles of Economics presented 
in Chapter 1: People respond to incentives.
To take from Peter to pay Paul, the government must pursue policies that redis-
tribute income. The U.S. federal income tax and welfare system are examples. 
Under these policies, people with high incomes pay high taxes, and people with 
low incomes receive income transfers. Yet if the government uses higher income 
taxes or phased-out transfers to take away additional income a person might earn, 
both Peter and Paul have less incentive to work hard. As they work less, society’s 
income falls, and so does total utility. The utilitarian government has to balance 
the gains from greater equality against the losses from distorted incentives. To 
maximize total utility, therefore, the government stops short of making society 
fully egalitarian.
A famous parable sheds light on the utilitarian’s logic. Imagine that Peter and 
Paul are thirsty travelers trapped at different places in the desert. Peter’s oasis has 
a lot of water; Paul’s has only a little. If the government could transfer water from 
one oasis to the other without cost, it would maximize total utility from water by 
equalizing the amount in the two places. But suppose that the government has 
only a leaky bucket. As it tries to move water from one place to the other, some of 
the water is lost in transit. In this case, a utilitarian government might still try to 
move some water from Peter to Paul, depending on the size of Paul’s thirst and 
the size of the bucket’s leak. But with only a leaky bucket at its disposal, a utilitar-
ian government will stop short of trying to reach complete equality.
Liberalism
A second way of thinking about inequality might be called liberalism. Philoso-
pher John Rawls develops this view in his book A Theory of Justice. This book was 
first published in 1971, and it quickly became a classic in political philosophy. 
Rawls begins with the premise that a society’s institutions, laws, and policies 
should be just. He then takes up the natural question: How can we, the members 
of society, ever agree on what justice means? It might seem that every person’s 
point of view is inevitably based on his or her particular circumstances—whether 
he or she is talented or less talented, diligent or lazy, educated or less educated, 
born to a wealthy family or a poor one. Could we ever objectively determine what 
a just society would be?

To answer this question, Rawls proposes the following thought experiment. 
Imagine that before any of us is born, we all get together in the beforelife (the 
pre-birth version of the afterlife) for a meeting to design the rules that will 
govern society. At this point, we are all ignorant about the station in life each 
of us will end up filling. In Rawls’s words, we are sitting in an “original posi-
tion” behind a “veil of ignorance.” In this original position, Rawls argues, we 
can choose a just set of rules for society because we must consider how those 
rules will affect every person. As Rawls puts it, “Since all are similarly situ-
ated and no one is able to design principles to favor his particular conditions, 
the principles of justice are the result of fair agreement or bargain.” Designing 
public policies and institutions in this way allows us to be objective about what 
policies are just. 
Rawls then considers what public policy designed behind this veil of ignorance 
would try to achieve. In particular, he considers what income distribution a per-
son would consider fair if that person did not know whether he or she would end 
up at the top, bottom, or middle of the distribution. Rawls argues that a person in 
the original position would be especially concerned about the possibility of being 
at the bottom of the income distribution. In designing public policies, therefore, 
we should aim to raise the welfare of the worst-off person in society. That is, 
rather than maximizing the sum of everyone’s utility, as a utilitarian would do, 
Rawls would maximize the minimum utility. Rawls’s rule is called the maximin 
criterion.
Because the maximin criterion emphasizes the least fortunate person in 
­society, it justifies public policies aimed at equalizing the distribution of 
income. By transferring income from the rich to the poor, society raises the 
well-being of the least fortunate. The maximin criterion would not, however, 
lead to a completely egalitarian society. If the government promised to equalize 
incomes completely, people would have no incentive to work hard, society’s 
total income would fall substantially, and the least fortunate person would be 
worse off. Thus, the maximin criterion still allows disparities in income because 
such disparities can improve incentives and thereby raise society’s ability to 
help the poor. Nonetheless, because Rawls’s philosophy puts weight on only 
the least fortunate members of society, it calls for more income redistribution 
than does utilitarianism.
Rawls’s views are controversial, but the thought experiment he proposes has 
much appeal. In particular, this thought experiment allows us to consider the 
redistribution of income as a form of social insurance. That is, from the perspec-
tive of the original position behind the veil of ignorance, income redistribution is 
like an insurance policy. Homeowners buy fire insurance to protect themselves 
from the risk of their house burning down. Similarly, when we as a society choose 
policies that tax the rich to supplement the incomes of the poor, we are all insur-
ing ourselves against the possibility that we might have been a member of a poor 
family. Because people dislike risk, we should be happy to have been born into a 
society that provides us this insurance. 
It is not at all clear, however, that rational people behind the veil of ignorance 
would truly be so averse to risk as to follow the maximin criterion. Indeed, 
because a person in the original position might end up anywhere in the distri-
bution of outcomes, he or she might treat all possible outcomes equally when 
designing public policies. In this case, the best policy behind the veil of ignorance 
would be to maximize the average utility of members of society, and the resulting 
notion of justice would be more utilitarian than Rawlsian.

CHAPTER 20    Income Inequality and Poverty
Libertarianism
A third view of inequality is called libertarianism. The two views we have consid-
ered so far—utilitarianism and liberalism—both view the total income of society 
as a shared resource that a social planner can freely redistribute to achieve some 
social goal. By contrast, libertarians argue that society itself earns no income—
only individual members of society earn income. According to libertarians, the 
government should not take from some individuals and give to others to achieve 
any particular distribution of income. 
For instance, philosopher Robert Nozick writes the following in his famous 
1974 book Anarchy, State, and Utopia:
We are not in the position of children who have been given portions of pie by 
someone who now makes last minute adjustments to rectify careless cutting. 
There is no central distribution, no person or group entitled to control all the 
resources, jointly deciding how they are to be doled out. What each person 
gets, he gets from others who give to him in exchange for something, or as a 
gift. In a free society, diverse persons control different resources, and new hold-
ings arise out of the voluntary exchanges and actions of persons.
Whereas utilitarians and liberals try to judge what amount of inequality is desir-
able in a society, Nozick denies the validity of this very question.
The libertarian alternative to evaluating economic outcomes is to evaluate 
the process by which these outcomes arise. When the distribution of income is 
achieved unfairly—for instance, when one person steals from another—the gov-
ernment has the right and duty to remedy the problem. But as long as the process 
determining the distribution of income is just, the resulting distribution is fair, no 
matter how unequal.
Nozick criticizes Rawls’s liberalism by drawing an analogy between the dis-
tribution of income in society and the distribution of grades in a course. Suppose 
you were asked to judge the fairness of the grades in the economics course you are 
now taking. Would you imagine yourself behind a veil of ignorance and choose 
a grade distribution without knowing the talents and efforts of each student? Or 
would you ensure that the process of assigning grades to students is fair without 
regard for whether the resulting distribution is equal or unequal? For the case of 
grades at least, the libertarian emphasis on process over outcomes is compelling.
Libertarians conclude that equality of opportunities is more important than 
equality of incomes. They believe that the government should enforce individual 
rights to ensure that everyone has the same opportunity to use his or her talents 
and achieve success. Once these rules of the game are established, the government 
has no reason to alter the resulting distribution of income.

Policies to Reduce Poverty
As we have just seen, political philosophers hold various views about what 
role the government should take in altering the distribution of income. Political 
debate among the larger population of voters reflects a similar disagreement. 
Despite these continuing debates, most people believe that, at the very least,

the ­government should try to help those most in need. According to a popular 
­metaphor, the government should provide a “safety net” to prevent any citizen 
from falling too far. 
Poverty is one of the most difficult problems that policymakers face. Poor 
families are more likely than the overall population to experience homelessness, 
drug dependence, health problems, teenage pregnancy, illiteracy, unemployment, 
and low educational attainment. Members of poor families are both more likely 
to commit crimes and more likely to be victims of crimes. Although it is hard to 
separate the causes of poverty from the effects, there is no doubt that poverty is 
associated with various economic and social ills. 
Suppose that you were a policymaker in the government, and your goal was 
to reduce the number of people living in poverty. How would you achieve this 
goal? Here we examine some of the policy options that you might consider. Each 
of these options helps some people escape poverty, but none of them is perfect, 
and deciding upon the best combination to use is not easy. 
Minimum-Wage Laws
Laws setting a minimum wage that employers can pay workers are a perennial 
source of debate. Advocates view the minimum wage as a way of helping the 
working poor without any cost to the government. Critics view it as hurting those 
it is intended to help.
The minimum wage is easily understood using the tools of supply and demand, 
as we first saw in Chapter 6. For workers with low levels of skill and experience, 
a high minimum wage forces the wage above the level that balances supply and 
demand. It therefore raises the cost of labor to firms and reduces the quantity of 
labor that those firms demand. The result is higher unemployment among those 
groups of workers affected by the minimum wage. Those workers who remain 
employed benefit from a higher wage, but those who might have been employed 
at a lower wage are worse off.
The magnitude of these effects depends crucially on the elasticity of demand. 
Advocates of a high minimum wage argue that the demand for unskilled labor 
is relatively inelastic so that a high minimum wage depresses employment only 
slightly. Critics of the minimum wage argue that labor demand is more elastic, 
especially in the long run when firms can adjust employment and production 
more fully. They also note that many minimum-wage workers are teenagers from 
middle-class families so that a high minimum wage is imperfectly targeted as a 
policy for helping the poor.
Welfare
One way for the government to raise the living standards of the poor is to supple-
ment their incomes. The primary way the government does this is through the 
welfare system. Welfare is a broad term that encompasses various government 
programs. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is a program that 
assists families with children and no adult able to support the family. In a typical 
family receiving such assistance, the father is absent, and the mother is at home 
raising small children. Another welfare program is Supplemental Security Income 
(SSI), which provides assistance to the poor who are sick or disabled. Note that 
for both of these welfare programs, a poor person cannot qualify for assistance 
simply by having a low income. He or she must also establish some additional 
“need,” such as small children or a disability.

CHAPTER 20    Income Inequality and Poverty
A common criticism of welfare programs is that they create incentives for 
people to become “needy.” For example, these programs may encourage families 
to break up, for many families qualify for financial assistance only if the father 
is absent. The programs may also encourage illegitimate births, for many poor, 
single women qualify for assistance only if they have children. Because poor, 
single mothers are such a large part of the poverty problem and because welfare 
programs seem to raise the number of poor, single mothers, critics of the welfare 
system assert that these policies exacerbate the very problems they are supposed 
to cure. As a result of these arguments, the welfare system was revised in a 1996 
law that limited the amount of time recipients could stay on welfare.
How severe are these potential problems with the welfare system? No one 
knows for sure. Proponents of the welfare system point out that being a poor, 
single mother on welfare is a difficult existence at best, and they are skeptical that 
many people would be encouraged to pursue such a life if it were not thrust upon 
them. Moreover, trends over time do not support the view that the decline of the 
two-parent family is largely a symptom of the welfare system, as the system’s 
critics sometimes claim. Since the early 1970s, welfare benefits (adjusted for infla-
tion) have declined, yet the percentage of children living with only one parent 
has risen.
Negative Income Tax
Whenever the government chooses a system to collect taxes, it affects the dis-
tribution of income. This is clearly true in the case of a progressive income tax, 
whereby high-income families pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes 
than do low-income families. As we discussed in Chapter 12, equity across income 
groups is an important criterion in the design of a tax system.
Many economists have advocated supplementing the income of the poor using 
a negative income tax. According to this policy, every family would report its 
income to the government. High-income families would pay a tax based on their 
incomes. Low-income families would receive a subsidy. In other words, they 
would “pay” a “negative tax.” 
For example, suppose the government used the following formula to compute 
a family’s tax liability:
	
Taxes owed 5 (1⁄3 of income) 2 $10,000.
In this case, a family that earned $60,000 would pay $10,000 in taxes, and a fam-
ily that earned $90,000 would pay $20,000 in taxes. A family that earned $30,000 
would owe nothing. And a family that earned $15,000 would “owe” 2$5,000. In 
other words, the government would send this family a check for $5,000.
Under a negative income tax, poor families would receive financial assistance 
without having to demonstrate need. The only qualification required to receive 
assistance would be a low income. Depending on one’s point of view, this fea-
ture can be either an advantage or a disadvantage. On the one hand, a negative 
income tax does not encourage illegitimate births and the breakup of families, 
as critics of the welfare system believe current policy does. On the other hand, 
a negative income tax would subsidize not only the unfortunate but also those 
who are simply lazy and, in some people’s eyes, undeserving of government 
support. 
One actual tax provision that works much like a negative income tax is the 
Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). This credit allows poor working families to

receive income tax refunds greater than the taxes they paid during the year. 
Because the Earned Income Tax Credit applies only to the working poor, it does 
not discourage recipients from working, as other antipoverty programs are 
claimed to do. For the same reason, however, it also does not help alleviate pov-
erty due to unemployment, sickness, or other inability to work. 
In-Kind Transfers
Another way to help the poor is to provide them directly with some of the goods 
and services they need to raise their living standards. For example, charities pro-
vide the needy with food, clothing, shelter, and toys at Christmas. The govern-
ment gives poor families food stamps, which are government vouchers that can be 
used to buy food at stores; the stores then redeem the vouchers for money. The 
government also gives many poor people healthcare through a program called 
Medicaid. 
Is it better to help the poor with these in-kind transfers or with direct cash pay-
ments? There is no clear answer. 
Advocates of in-kind transfers argue that such transfers ensure that the poor 
get what they need most. Among the poorest members of society, alcohol and 
How Inequality 
Fueled the Crisis
By Raghuram Rajan
B
efore the recent financial crisis, politicians 
on both sides of the aisle in the United 
States egged on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 
the giant government-backed mortgage agen-
cies, to support low-income lending in their 
constituencies. There was a deeper concern 
behind this newly discovered passion for hous-
ing for the poor: growing income inequality.
Since the 1970’s, wages for workers at 
the 90th percentile of the wage distribution 
in the U.S.—such as office managers—
have grown much faster than wages for the 
median worker (at the 50th percentile), such 
as factory workers and office assistants. A 
number of factors are responsible for the 
growth in the 90/50 differential.
Perhaps the most important is that 
technological progress in the U.S. requires 
the labor force to have ever greater skills. A 
high school diploma was sufficient for office 
workers 40 years ago, whereas an under-
graduate degree is barely sufficient today. 
But the education system has been unable 
to provide enough of the labor force with 
the necessary education. The reasons range 
from indifferent nutrition, socialization, and 
early-childhood learning to dysfunctional 
primary and secondary schools that leave 
too many Americans unprepared for college.
The everyday consequence for the 
middle class is a stagnant paycheck and 
growing job insecurity. Politicians feel their 
constituents’ pain, but it is hard to improve 
the quality of education, for improvement 
requires real and effective policy change in 
an area where too many vested interests 
favor the status quo.
Moreover, any change will require 
years to take effect, and therefore will not 
address the electorate’s current ­anxiety. 
 The Root Cause of a Financial Crisis
In 2008 and 2009, the U.S. economy experienced a financial crisis and a 
deep economic downturn. In this opinion piece, an economist suggests that 
these events can be traced back to the changing distribution of income.

drug addiction is more common than it is in society as a whole. By providing the 
poor with food and shelter, society can be more confident that it is not helping to 
support such addictions. This is one reason in-kind transfers are more politically 
popular than cash payments to the poor.
Advocates of cash payments, on the other hand, argue that in-kind transfers 
are inefficient and disrespectful. The government does not know what goods and 
services the poor need most. Many of the poor are ordinary people down on their 
luck. Despite their misfortune, they are in the best position to decide how to raise 
their own living standards. Rather than giving the poor in-kind transfers of goods 
and services that they may not want, it may be better to give them cash and allow 
them to buy what they think they need most.
Antipoverty Programs and Work Incentives
Many policies aimed at helping the poor can have the unintended effect of dis-
couraging the poor from escaping poverty on their own. To see why, consider the 
following example. Suppose that a family needs an income of $20,000 to maintain 
a reasonable standard of living. And suppose that, out of concern for the poor, the 
government promises to guarantee every family that income. Whatever a family 
Thus, politicians have looked for other, 
quicker ways to mollify their constituents. We 
have long understood that it is not income 
that matters, but consumption. A smart or 
cynical politician would see that if somehow 
middle-class households’ consumption kept 
up, if they could afford a new car every few 
years and the occasional exotic holiday, per-
haps they would pay less attention to their 
stagnant paychecks.
Therefore, the political response to rising 
inequality—whether carefully planned or 
the path of least resistance—was to expand 
lending to households, especially low-
income households. The benefits—growing 
consumption and more jobs—were imme-
diate, whereas paying the inevitable bill 
could be postponed into the future. Cynical 
as it might seem, easy credit has been used 
throughout history as a palliative by govern-
ments that are unable to address the deeper 
anxieties of the middle class directly.
Politicians, however, prefer to couch the 
objective in more uplifting and persuasive 
terms than that of crassly increasing con-
sumption. In the U.S., the expansion of home 
ownership—a key element of the American 
dream—to low- and ­middle-income house-
holds was the defensible linchpin for the 
broader aims of expanding credit and 
consumption…. 
In the end, though, the misguided 
attempt to push home ownership through 
credit has left the U.S. with houses that no 
one can afford and households drowning in 
debt. Ironically, since 2004, the homeowner-
ship rate has been in decline.
The problem, as often is the case with 
government policies, was not intent. It rarely 
is. But when lots of easy money pushed by a 
deep-pocketed government comes into contact 
with the profit motive of a sophisticated, com-
petitive, and amoral financial sector, matters 
get taken far beyond the government’s intent. 
This is not, of course, the first time in 
history that credit expansion has been used 
to assuage the concerns of a group that is 
being left behind, nor will it be the last. 
In fact, one does not even need to look 
outside the U.S. for examples. The deregu-
lation and rapid expansion of banking in 
the U.S. in the early years of the twentieth 
century was in many ways a response to the 
Populist movement, backed by small and 
medium-sized farmers who found them-
selves falling behind the growing numbers 
of industrial workers, and demanded easier 
credit. Excessive rural credit was one of the 
important causes of bank failures during the 
Great Depression.
The broader implication is that we need 
to look beyond greedy bankers and spine-
less regulators (and there were plenty of 
both) for the root causes of this crisis. 
And the problems are not solved with a 
financial regulatory bill entrusting more 
powers to those regulators. America needs 
to tackle inequality at its root, by giving 
more Americans the ability to compete in 
the global marketplace. This is much harder 
than doling out credit, but more effective in 
the long run.

What effect would you expect this policy to have?
The incentive effects of this policy are obvious: Any person who would make 
under $20,000 by working has little incentive to find and keep a job. For every 
dollar that the person would earn, the government would reduce the income 
supplement by a dollar. In effect, the government taxes 100 percent of additional 
earnings. An effective marginal tax rate of 100 percent is surely a policy with a 
large deadweight loss.
The adverse effects of this high effective tax rate can persist over time. A person 
discouraged from working loses the on-the-job training that a job might offer. In 
addition, his or her children miss the lessons learned by observing a parent with a 
full-time job, and this may adversely affect their own ability to find and hold a job. 
Although the antipoverty program we have been discussing is hypothetical, 
it is not as unrealistic as might first appear. Welfare, Medicaid, food stamps, and 
the Earned Income Tax Credit are all programs aimed at helping the poor, and 
they are all tied to family income. As a family’s income rises, the family becomes 
ineligible for these programs. When all these programs are taken together, it is 
common for families to face effective marginal tax rates that are very high. Some-
times the effective marginal tax rates even exceed 100 percent so that poor families 
are worse off when they earn more. By trying to help the poor, the government 
discourages those families from working. According to critics of antipoverty 
programs, these programs alter work attitudes and create a “culture of poverty.”
It might seem that there is an easy solution to this problem: Reduce benefits to 
poor families more gradually as their incomes rise. For example, if a poor fam-
ily loses 30 cents of benefits for every dollar it earns, then it faces an effective 
marginal tax rate of 30 percent. Although this effective tax reduces work effort to 
some extent, it does not eliminate the incentive to work completely. 
The problem with this solution is that it greatly increases the cost of programs 
to combat poverty. If benefits are phased out gradually as a poor family’s income 
rises, then families just above the poverty level will also be eligible for substantial 
benefits. The more gradual the phase-out, the more families are eligible, and the 
more the program costs. Thus, policymakers face a trade-off between burdening 
the poor with high effective marginal tax rates and burdening taxpayers with 
costly programs to reduce poverty.
There are various other ways to reduce the work disincentive of antipoverty 
programs. One is to require any person collecting benefits to accept a govern-
ment-provided job—a system sometimes called workfare. Another possibility is to 
provide benefits for only a limited period of time. This route was taken in the 1996 
welfare reform bill, which imposed a five-year lifetime limit on welfare recipients. 
When President Clinton signed the bill, he explained his policy as follows: “Wel-
fare should be a second chance, not a way of life.”
QUICK QUIZ  List three policies aimed at helping the poor, and discuss the pros and 
cons of each.
Conclusion
People have long reflected on the distribution of income in society. Plato, the 
ancient Greek philosopher, concluded that in an ideal society the income of the 
richest person would be no more than four times the income of the poorest ­person.

CHAPTER 20    Income Inequality and Poverty
Although the measurement of inequality is difficult, it is clear that our society has 
much more inequality than Plato recommended.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that govern-
ments can sometimes improve market outcomes. There is little consensus, how-
ever, about how this principle should be applied to the distribution of income. 
Philosophers and policymakers today do not agree on how much income inequal-
ity is desirable, or even whether public policy should aim to alter the distribution 
of income. Much of public debate reflects this disagreement. Whenever taxes are 
raised, for instance, lawmakers argue over how much of the tax hike should fall 
on the rich, the middle class, and the poor.
Another of the Ten Principles of Economics is that people face trade-offs. This 
principle is important to keep in mind when thinking about economic inequal-
ity. Policies that penalize the successful and reward the unsuccessful reduce 
the incentive to succeed. Thus, policymakers face a trade-off between equality 
and efficiency. The more equally the pie is divided, the smaller the pie becomes. 
This is the one lesson concerning the distribution of income about which almost 
­everyone agrees.
• Data on the distribution of income show a wide 
disparity in U.S. society. The richest fifth of fami-
lies earns more than ten times as much income as 
the poorest fifth.
• Because in-kind transfers, the economic life 
cycle, transitory income, and economic mobil-
ity are so important for understanding variation 
in income, it is difficult to gauge the degree of 
inequality in our society using data on the dis-
tribution of income in a single year. When these 
other factors are taken into account, they tend to 
suggest that economic well-being is more equally 
distributed than is annual income.
• Political philosophers differ in their views about 
the role of government in altering the distribu-
tion of income. Utilitarians (such as John Stuart 
Mill) would choose the distribution of income 
to maximize the sum of utility of everyone in 
society. Liberals (such as John Rawls) would 
determine the distribution of income as if we 
were behind a “veil of ignorance” that prevented 
us from knowing our stations in life. Libertarians 
(such as Robert Nozick) would have the govern-
ment enforce individual rights to ensure a fair 
process but then not be concerned about inequal-
ity in the resulting distribution of income. 
• Various policies aim to help the poor—minimum-
wage laws, welfare, negative income taxes, and 
in-kind transfers. While these policies help some 
families escape poverty, they also have unin-
tended side effects. Because financial assistance 
declines as income rises, the poor often face very 
high effective marginal tax rates, which discourage 
poor families from escaping poverty on their own.

Questions for Review
	 1.	 Does the richest fifth of the U.S. population 
earn closer to two, four, or ten times the income 
of the poorest fifth?
	 2.	 How does the extent of income inequality in 
the United States compare to that of other 
nations around the world?
	 3.	 What groups in the U.S. population are most 
likely to live in poverty?
	 4.	 When gauging the amount of inequality,  
why do transitory and life cycle variations in 
income cause difficulties? 
	 5.	 How would a utilitarian, a liberal, and a  
libertarian determine how much income 
inequality is permissible?
	 6.	 What are the pros and cons of in-kind (rather 
than cash) transfers to the poor?
	 7.	 Describe how antipoverty programs can  
discourage the poor from working. How might 
you reduce this disincentive? What are the  
disadvantages of your proposed policy?
Problems and Applications
	 1.	 Table 2 shows that income inequality in the 
United States has increased since 1970. Some 
factors contributing to this increase were  
discussed in Chapter 19. What are they?
	 2.	 Table 3 shows that the percentage of children in 
families with income below the poverty line far 
exceeds the percentage of the elderly in such 
families. How might the allocation of govern-
ment money across different social programs 
have contributed to this phenomenon?  
(Hint: See Chapter 12.)
	 3.	 Economists often view life cycle variation in 
income as one form of transitory variation in 
income around people’s lifetime, or permanent, 
income. In this sense, how does your current 
income compare to your permanent income? 
Do you think your current income accurately 
reflects your standard of living? 
	 4.	 The chapter discusses the importance of  
economic mobility.
a.	 What policies might the government  
pursue to increase economic mobility within 
a generation?
b.	What policies might the government  
pursue to increase economic mobility  
across generations?
c.	 Do you think we should reduce spending  
on current welfare programs to increase 
spending on programs that enhance  
economic mobility? What are some of  
the advantages and disadvantages of  
doing so?
	 5.	 Consider two communities. In one community, 
ten families have incomes of $100,000 each and 
ten families have incomes of $20,000 each. In 
the other community, ten families have incomes 
of $200,000 each and ten families have incomes 
of $22,000 each.
a.	 In which community is the distribution  
of income more unequal? In which commu-
nity is the problem of poverty likely to  
be worse?
b.	Which distribution of income would Rawls 
prefer? Explain.
c.	 Which distribution of income do you prefer? 
Explain. 
d.	Why might someone have the opposite  
preference?
	 6.	 This chapter uses the analogy of a “leaky 
bucket” to explain one constraint on the  
redistribution of income.
a.	 What elements of the U.S. system for  
redistributing income create the leaks in the 
bucket? Be specific.
b.	Do you think that Republicans or Democrats 
generally believe that the bucket used 
for redistributing income is leakier? How 
does that belief affect their views about the 
amount of income redistribution that the 
government should undertake?
	 7.	 Suppose there are two possible income dis-
tributions in a society of ten people. In the 
first distribution, nine people have incomes 
of $30,000 and one person has an income of

$10,000. In the second distribution, all ten  
people have incomes of $25,000.
a.	 If the society had the first income distribu-
tion, what would be the utilitarian argument 
for redistributing income?
b.	Which income distribution would Rawls 
consider more equitable? Explain.
c.	 Which income distribution would Nozick 
consider more equitable? Explain.
	 8.	 The poverty rate would be substantially lower 
if the market value of in-kind transfers were 
added to family income. The largest in-kind 
transfer is Medicaid, the government health 
program for the poor. Let’s say the program 
costs $7,000 per recipient family.
a.	 If the government gave each recipient fam-
ily a $7,000 check instead of enrolling them 
in the Medicaid program, do you think that 
most of these families would spend that 
money to purchase health insurance? Why? 
(Recall that the poverty level for a family of 
four is about $20,000.)
b.	How does your answer to part (a) affect 
your view about whether we should deter-
mine the poverty rate by valuing in-kind 
transfers at the price the government pays 
for them? Explain.
c.	 How does your answer to part (a) affect 
your view about whether we should provide 
assistance to the poor in the form of cash 
transfers or in-kind transfers? Explain.
	 9.	 Consider two of the income security programs 
in the United States: Temporary Assistance for 
Needy Families (TANF) and the Earned Income 
Tax Credit (EITC).
a.	 When a woman with children and very low 
income earns an extra dollar, she receives 
less in TANF benefits. What do you think 
is the effect of this feature of TANF on 
the labor supply of low-income women? 
Explain.
b.	The EITC provides greater benefits as low-
income workers earn more income (up to a 
point). What do you think is the effect of this 
program on the labor supply of low-income 
individuals? Explain.
c.	 What are the disadvantages of eliminat-
ing TANF and allocating the savings to the 
EITC?
	10.	 In the spring of 2010, President Barack Obama 
signed sweeping healthcare legislation with the 
aim of providing healthcare to most Americans, 
financed in part by increasing taxes on those 
with high incomes. Which of the political phi-
losophers discussed in this chapter do you 
think would most likely support this legislation 
and why? Would any of them be against it?
