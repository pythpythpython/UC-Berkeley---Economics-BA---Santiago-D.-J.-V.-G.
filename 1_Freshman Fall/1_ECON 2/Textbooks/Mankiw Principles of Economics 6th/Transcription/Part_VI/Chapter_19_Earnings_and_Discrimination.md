Earnings and 
    Discrimination
I
n the United States today, the typical physician earns about $200,000 a year, 
the typical police officer about $50,000, and the typical farmworker about 
$20,000. These examples illustrate the large differences in earnings that are 
so common in our economy. The differences explain why some people live 
in mansions, ride in limousines, and vacation on the French Riviera, while other 
people live in small apartments, ride a bus, and vacation in their own backyards.
Why do earnings vary so much from person to person? Chapter 18, which 
developed the basic neoclassical theory of the labor market, offers an answer to 
this question. There we saw that wages are governed by labor supply and labor 
demand. Labor demand, in turn, reflects the marginal productivity of labor. In 
equilibrium, each worker is paid the value of his or her marginal contribution to 
the economy’s production of goods and services. 
This theory of the labor market, though widely accepted by economists, is only 
the beginning of the story. To understand the wide variation in earnings that we

observe, we must go beyond this general framework and examine more precisely 
what determines the supply and demand for different types of labor. That is our 
goal in this chapter. 
Some Determinants of Equilibrium Wages
Workers differ from one another in many ways. Jobs also have differing charac-
teristics—both in terms of the wage they pay and in terms of their nonmonetary 
attributes. In this section, we consider how the characteristics of jobs and workers 
affect labor supply, labor demand, and equilibrium wages. 
Compensating Differentials 
When a worker is deciding whether to take a job, the wage is only one of many 
job attributes that the worker takes into account. Some jobs are easy, fun, and safe, 
while others are hard, dull, and dangerous. The better the job as gauged by these 
nonmonetary characteristics, the more people there are who are willing to do the job 
at any given wage. In other words, the supply of labor for easy, fun, and safe jobs 
is greater than the supply of labor for hard, dull, and dangerous jobs. As a result, 
“good” jobs will tend to have lower equilibrium wages than “bad” jobs. 
For example, imagine you are looking for a summer job in a local beach com-
munity. Two kinds of jobs are available. You can take a job as a beach-badge 
checker, or you can take a job as a garbage collector. The beach-badge checkers 
take leisurely strolls along the beach during the day and check to make sure the 
tourists have bought the required beach permits. The garbage collectors wake up 
before dawn to drive dirty, noisy trucks around town to pick up garbage. Which 
job would you want? Most people would prefer the beach job if the wages were the 
same. To induce people to become garbage collectors, the town has to offer higher 
wages to garbage collectors than to beach-badge checkers. 
Economists use the term compensating differential to refer to a difference in 
wages that arises from nonmonetary characteristics of different jobs. Compensating 
differentials are prevalent in the economy. Here are some examples: 
• 	 Coal miners are paid more than other workers with similar levels of edu-
cation. Their higher wage compensates them for the dirty and dangerous 
nature of coal mining, as well as the long-term health problems that coal 
miners experience. 
• 	 Workers who work the night shift at factories are paid more than similar 
workers who work the day shift. The higher wage compensates them for 
having to work at night and sleep during the day, a lifestyle that most  
people find undesirable.
• 	 Professors are paid less than lawyers and doctors, who have similar 
amounts of education. Professors’ lower wages compensate them for the 
great intellectual and personal satisfaction that their jobs offer. (Indeed, 
teaching economics is so much fun that it is surprising that economics  
professors are paid anything at all!)
Human Capital
As we discussed in the previous chapter, the word capital usually refers to the 
economy’s stock of equipment and structures. The capital stock includes the 
compensating 
differential

that arises to offset the 
nonmonetary character-

farmer’s tractor, the manufacturer’s factory, and the teacher’s chalkboard. The 
essence of capital is that it is a factor of production that itself has been produced.
There is another type of capital that, while less tangible than physical capital, is 
just as important to the economy’s production. Human capital is the accumulation 
of investments in people. The most important type of human capital is education. 
Like all forms of capital, education represents an expenditure of resources at one 
time to raise productivity in the future. But unlike an investment in other forms of 
capital, an investment in education is tied to a specific person, and this linkage is 
what makes it human capital.
Not surprisingly, workers with more human capital on average earn more 
than those with less human capital. College graduates in the United States, for 
example, earn almost twice as much as those workers who end their education 
with a high school diploma. This large difference has been documented in many 
countries around the world. It tends to be even larger in less developed countries, 
where educated workers are in scarce supply.
It is easy to see why education raises wages from the perspective of supply 
and demand. Firms—the demanders of labor—are willing to pay more for the 
highly educated because highly educated workers have higher marginal prod-
ucts. Workers—the suppliers of labor—are willing to pay the cost of becoming 
educated only if there is a reward for doing so. In essence, the difference in wages 
between highly educated workers and less educated workers may be considered 
a compensating differential for the cost of becoming educated.
The Increasing Value of Skills
“The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer.” Like many adages, this one is not 
always true, but it has been in recent years. Many studies have documented that 
the earnings gap between workers with high skills and workers with low skills 
has increased over the past two decades.
	
Table 1 presents data on the average earnings of college graduates and of 
high school graduates without any additional education. These data show the 
increase in the financial reward from education. In 1980, a man on average 
earned 44 percent more with a college degree than without one; by 2008, this fig-
ure had risen to 88 percent. For a woman, the reward for attending college rose 
from a 35 percent increase in earnings to a 71 percent increase. The incentive to 
stay in school is as great today as it has ever been.
	
Why has the gap in earnings between skilled and unskilled workers widened 
in recent years? No one knows for sure, but economists have proposed two 
hypotheses to explain this trend. Both hypotheses suggest that the demand for 
skilled labor has risen over time relative to the demand for unskilled labor. The 
shift in demand has led to a corresponding change in wages, which in turn has 
led to greater inequality.
	
The first hypothesis is that international trade has altered the relative demand 
for skilled and unskilled labor. In recent years, the amount of trade with other 
countries has increased substantially. As a percentage of total U.S. production 
of goods and services, imports have risen from 5 percent in 1970 to 14 percent in 
2009, and exports have risen from 6 percent in 1970 to 11 percent in 2009. Because 
unskilled labor is plentiful and cheap in many foreign countries, the United States 
tends to import goods produced with unskilled labor and export goods produced

with skilled labor. Thus, when international trade expands, the domestic demand 
for skilled labor rises, and the domestic demand for unskilled labor falls.
	
The second hypothesis is that changes in technology have altered the relative 
demand for skilled and unskilled labor. Consider, for instance, the introduction 
of computers. Computers raise the demand for skilled workers who can use the 
new machines and reduce the demand for the unskilled workers whose jobs are 
replaced by the computers. For example, many companies now rely more on com-
puter databases, and less on filing cabinets, to keep business records. This change 
raises the demand for computer programmers and reduces the demand for filing 
clerks. Thus, as more firms use computers, the demand for skilled labor rises, and 
the demand for unskilled labor falls.
	
Economists have found it difficult to gauge the validity of these two hypotheses. 
It is possible that both are true: Increasing international trade and technological 
change may share responsibility for the increasing income inequality we have 
observed in recent decades.  ■
Ability, Effort, and Chance
Why do major league baseball players get paid more than minor league players? 
Certainly, the higher wage is not a compensating differential. Playing in the major 
leagues is not a less pleasant job than playing in the minor leagues; in fact, the 
opposite is true. The major leagues do not require more years of schooling or more 
experience. To a large extent, players in the major leagues earn more just because 
they have greater natural ability. 
Natural ability is important for workers in all occupations. Because of heredity 
and upbringing, people differ in their physical and mental attributes. Some peo-
ple are strong, others weak. Some people are smart, others less so. Some people 
are outgoing, others awkward in social situations. These and many other personal 
characteristics determine how productive workers are and, therefore, play a role 
in determining the wages they earn.

always earned more than 
workers without the benefit 
of college, but the salary

CHAPTER 19    Earnings and Discrimination
Closely related to ability is effort. Some people work hard; others are lazy. We 
should not be surprised to find that those who work hard are more productive 
and earn higher wages. To some extent, firms reward workers directly by pay-
ing people based on what they produce. Salespeople, for instance, are often paid 
a percentage of the sales they make. At other times, hard work is rewarded less 
directly in the form of a higher annual salary or a bonus.
Chance also plays a role in determining wages. If a person attended a trade 
school to learn how to repair televisions with vacuum tubes and then found this 
skill made obsolete by the invention of solid-state electronics, he or she would end 
up earning a low wage compared to others with similar years of training. The low 
wage of this worker is due to chance—a phenomenon that economists recognize 
but do not shed much light on.
How important are ability, effort, and chance in determining wages? It is hard 
to say because these factors are difficult to measure. But indirect evidence sug-
gests that they are very important. When labor economists study wages, they 
relate a worker’s wage to those variables that can be measured, such as years of 
schooling, years of experience, age, and job characteristics. All these measured 
variables affect a worker’s wage as theory predicts, but they account for less than 
half of the variation in wages in our economy. Because so much of the variation in 
wages is left unexplained, omitted variables, including ability, effort, and chance, 
must play an important role.
The Benefits of Beauty 
People differ in many ways. One difference is in how attractive they are. The 
actress Keira Knightley, for instance, is a beautiful woman. In part for this reason, 
her movies attract large audiences. Not surprisingly, the large audiences mean a 
large income for Ms. Knightley.
	
How prevalent are the economic benefits of beauty? Labor economists Daniel 
Hamermesh and Jeff Biddle tried to answer this question in a study published in 
the December 1994 issue of the American Economic Review. Hamermesh and Biddle 
examined data from surveys of individuals in the United States and Canada. The 
interviewers who conducted the survey were asked to rate each respondent’s 
physical appearance. Hamermesh and Biddle then examined how much the 
wages of the respondents depended on the standard determinants—education, 
experience, and so on—and how much they depended on physical appearance.
	
Hamermesh and Biddle found that beauty pays. People who are deemed more 
attractive than average earn 5 percent more than people of average looks, and 
people of average looks earn 5 to 10 percent more than people considered less 
attractive than average. Similar results were found for men and women.
	
What explains these differences in wages? There are several ways to interpret 
the “beauty premium.”
	
One interpretation is that good looks are themselves a type of innate ability 
determining productivity and wages. Some people are born with the physical 
attributes of a movie star; other people are not. Good looks are useful in any job in 
which workers present themselves to the public—such as acting, sales, and wait-
ing on tables. In this case, an attractive worker is more valuable to the firm than 
an unattractive worker. The firm’s willingness to pay more to attractive workers 
reflects its customers’ preferences.

A second interpretation is that reported beauty is an indirect measure of 
other types of ability. How attractive a person appears depends on more than 
just heredity. It also depends on dress, hairstyle, personal demeanor, and other 
attributes that a person can control. Perhaps a person who successfully projects 
an attractive image in a survey interview is more likely to be an intelligent person 
who succeeds at other tasks as well.
	
A third interpretation is that the beauty premium is a type of discrimination, a 
topic to which we return later.  ■
An Alternative View of Education: Signaling
Earlier we discussed the human-capital view of education, according to which 
schooling raises workers’ wages because it makes them more productive. 
Although this view is widely accepted, some economists have proposed an alter-
native theory, which emphasizes that firms use educational attainment as a way 
of sorting between high-ability and low-ability workers. According to this alter-
native view, when people earn a college degree, for instance, they do not become 
more productive, but they do signal their high ability to prospective employers. 
Because it is easier for high-ability people to earn a college degree than it is for 
low-ability people, more high-ability people get college degrees. As a result, it is 
rational for firms to interpret a college degree as a signal of ability.
The signaling theory of education is similar to the signaling theory of advertis-
ing discussed in Chapter 16. In the signaling theory of advertising, the advertise-
ment itself contains no real information, but the firm signals the quality of its 
product to consumers by its willingness to spend money on advertising. In the 
signaling theory of education, schooling has no real productivity benefit, but the 
worker signals his innate productivity to employers by his willingness to spend 
years at school. In both cases, an action is being taken not for its intrinsic benefit 
but because the willingness to take that action conveys private information to 
someone observing it.
Thus, we now have two views of education: the human-capital theory and 
the signaling theory. Both views can explain why more educated workers tend 
to earn more than less educated workers. According to the human-capital view, 
education makes workers more productive; according to the signaling view, edu-
cation is correlated with natural ability. But the two views have radically different 
predictions for the effects of policies that aim to increase educational attainment. 
According to the human-capital view, increasing educational levels for all work-
ers would raise all workers’ productivity and thereby their wages. According to 
the signaling view, education does not enhance productivity, so raising all work-
ers’ educational levels would not affect wages. 
Most likely, the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes. The benefits 
to education are probably a combination of the productivity-enhancing effects of 
human capital and the productivity-revealing effects of signaling. The open ques-
tion is the relative size of these two effects.
The Superstar Phenomenon
Although most actors earn little and often take jobs as waiters to support them-
selves, Johnny Depp earns millions of dollars for each film he makes. Similarly, 
while most people who play tennis do it for free as a hobby, Serena Williams earns 
millions on the pro tour. Depp and Williams are superstars in their fields, and 
their great public appeal is reflected in astronomical incomes.

Even for Shoe 
Bombers, Education 
and Success Are Linked 
By Austan Goolsbee
T
he fifth anniversary of 9/11 passed with a 
great deal of hand-wringing over all the 
people who want to kill Americans. Especially 
worrisome is the apparent rise of terrorists 
whose origins seem far from fanatical.
These terrorists are not desperately poor 
uneducated people from the Middle East. A 
surprisingly large share of them have college 
and even graduate degrees. Increasingly, 
they seem to be from Britain, like the shoe 
bomber Richard C. Reid and most of the 
suspects in the London Underground bomb-
ings and the liquid explosives plot.
This has left the public wondering, Why 
are some educated people from Western 
countries so prone to fanaticism?
Before trying to answer that question, 
though, some economists argue that we 
need to think about what makes a success-
ful terrorist and they warn against extrapo-
lating from the terrorists we catch. It is a 
problem economists typically refer to as 
“selection bias.”
In their new study, “Attack Assignments 
in Terror Organizations and the Productivity 
of Suicide Bombers,” two economists, 
Efraim Benmelech of Harvard University and 
Claude Berrebi of the RAND Corporation, 
set out to analyze the productivity of 
 terrorists in the same way they might ana-
lyze the auto industry. But they defined the 
“success” of terrorists by their ability to kill.
They gathered data on Palestinian sui-
cide bombers in Israel from 2000 to 2005 
and found that for terrorists, just like for 
regular workers, experience and educa-
tion improve productivity. Suicide bombers 
who are older—in their late 20’s and early 
30’s—and better educated are less likely to 
be caught on their missions and are more 
likely to kill large numbers of people at big-
ger, more difficult targets than younger and 
more poorly educated bombers.
Professor Benmelech and Dr. Berrebi 
compare a Who’s Who of the biggest suicide 
bombers to more typical bombers. Whereas 
typical bombers were younger than 21 and 
about 18 percent of them had at least some 
college education, the average age of the 
most successful bombers was almost 26 and 
60 percent of them were college educated.
Experience and education also affect the 
chances of being caught. Every additional 
year of age reduces the chance by 12 percent. 
Having more than a high school education 
cuts the chance by more than half.
There are many examples where young 
or uneducated terrorists made stupid mis-
takes that foiled them. Professor Benmelech 
recounts the case last April of a teenager 
from Nablus apprehended by Israeli soldiers 
before carrying out his bombing because he 
was wearing an overcoat on a 95-degree 
day. Mr. Reid, the failed shoe bomber, had 
only a high school degree. Would an older 
terrorist with more education have tried to 
light a match on his shoe (as Mr. Reid did) in 
plain view of the flight attendant and other 
passengers who proceeded to thwart his 
plan? Would a better-educated terrorist have 
been more discreet? We will never know.
The research suggests, however, that 
there may be a reason that the average age 
of the 9/11 hijackers (at least the ones for 
whom we have a birth date) was close to 26 
and that the supposed leader, Mohammed 
Atta, was 33 with a graduate degree.
As Professor Benmelech put it in an 
interview: “It’s clear that there are some 
terrorist missions that require a certain level 
of skill to accomplish. The older terrorists 
with better educations seem to be less likely 
to fail them. Perhaps it is not surprising, 
then, that terrorist organizers assign them 
to these more difficult missions.”
Among Palestinian suicide bombers, 
the older and better-educated bombers are 
assigned to targets in bigger cities where 
they can potentially kill greater numbers 
of people. That same idea means that the 
terrorists assigned to attack the United 
States are probably different from the typi-
cal terrorist. They will be drawn from people 
whose skills make them better at evading 
security. 
 The Human Capital of Terrorists
Workers with more education are better at all kinds of tasks, even those 
aimed at destruction.

PART vI	
The Economics of Labor Markets
Why do Depp and Williams earn so much? It is not surprising that incomes 
differ within occupations. Good carpenters earn more than mediocre carpenters, 
and good plumbers earn more than mediocre plumbers. People vary in ability and 
effort, and these differences lead to differences in income. Yet the best carpenters 
and plumbers do not earn the many millions that are common among the best 
actors and athletes. What explains the difference?
To understand the tremendous incomes of Depp and Williams, we must exam-
ine the special features of the markets in which they sell their services. Superstars 
arise in markets that have two characteristics:
• 	 Every customer in the market wants to enjoy the good supplied by the best 
producer. 
• 	 The good is produced with a technology that makes it possible for the best 
producer to supply every customer at low cost.
If Johnny Depp is the best actor around, then everyone will want to see his next 
movie; seeing twice as many movies by an actor half as talented is not a good 
substitute. Moreover, it is possible for everyone to enjoy a performance by Johnny 
Depp. Because it is easy to make multiple copies of a film, Depp can provide his 
service to millions of people simultaneously. Similarly, because tennis games are 
broadcast on television, millions of fans can enjoy the extraordinary athletic skills 
of Serena Williams.
We can now see why there are no superstar carpenters and plumbers. Other 
things equal, everyone prefers to employ the best carpenter, but a carpenter, 
unlike a movie actor, can provide his services to only a limited number of cus-
tomers. Although the best carpenter will be able to command a somewhat higher 
wage than the average carpenter, the average carpenter will still be able to earn 
a good living.
Above-Equilibrium Wages: Minimum-Wage  
Laws, Unions, and Efficiency Wages
Most analyses of wage differences among workers are based on the equilibrium 
model of the labor market—that is, wages are assumed to adjust to balance labor 
supply and labor demand. But this assumption does not always apply. For some 
workers, wages are set above the level that brings supply and demand into equi-
librium. Let’s consider three reasons this might be so.
One reason for above-equilibrium wages is minimum-wage laws, as we first 
saw in Chapter 6. Most workers in the economy are not affected by these laws 
because their equilibrium wages are well above the legal minimum. But for some 
workers, especially the least skilled and experienced, minimum-wage laws raise 
wages above the level they would earn in an unregulated labor market.
A second reason that wages might rise above their equilibrium level is the 
market power of labor unions. A union is a worker association that bargains with 
employers over wages and working conditions. Unions often raise wages above 
the level that would prevail without a union, perhaps because they can threaten 
to withhold labor from the firm by calling a strike. Studies suggest that union 
workers earn about 10 to 20 percent more than similar nonunion workers.
A third reason for above-equilibrium wages is suggested by the theory of 
efficiency wages. This theory holds that a firm can find it profitable to pay high 
wages because doing so increases the productivity of its workers. In particular, 
union
a worker association that 
bargains with employers 
over wages and working 
conditions
strike
the organized withdrawal 
of labor from a firm by a 
union

CHAPTER 19    Earnings and Discrimination
high wages may reduce worker turnover, increase worker effort, and raise the 
quality of workers who apply for jobs at the firm. If this theory is correct, then 
some firms may choose to pay their workers more than they would normally earn.
Above-equilibrium wages, whether caused by minimum-wage laws, unions, 
or efficiency wages, have similar effects on the labor market. In particular, push-
ing a wage above the equilibrium level raises the quantity of labor supplied and 
reduces the quantity of labor demanded. The result is a surplus of labor, or unem-
ployment. The study of unemployment and the public policies aimed to deal with 
it is usually considered a topic within macroeconomics, so it goes beyond the 
scope of this chapter. But it would be a mistake to ignore these issues completely 
when analyzing earnings. Although most wage differences can be understood 
while maintaining the assumption of equilibrium in the labor market, above-
equilibrium wages play a role in some cases.

reasons more educated workers earn more than less educated workers.
The Economics of Discrimination
Another source of differences in wages is discrimination. Discrimination occurs 
when the marketplace offers different opportunities to similar individuals who 
differ only by race, ethnic group, sex, age, or other personal characteristics. 
Discrimination reflects some people’s prejudice against certain groups in society. 
Discrimination is an emotionally charged topic that often generates heated debate, 
but economists try to study the topic objectively to separate myth from reality.
Measuring Labor-Market Discrimination
How much does discrimination in labor markets affect the earnings of different 
groups of workers? This question is important, but answering it is not easy.
There is no doubt that different groups of workers earn substantially different 
wages, as Table 2 demonstrates. The median black man in the United States is 
paid 21 percent less than the median white man, and the median black woman 
is paid 13 percent less than the median white woman. The differences by sex are 
also significant. The median white woman is paid 24 percent less than the median

white man, and the median black woman is paid 15 percent less than the median 
black man. Taken at face value, these differentials look like evidence that employ-
ers discriminate against blacks and women.
Yet there is a potential problem with this inference. Even in a labor market 
free of discrimination, different people have different wages. People differ in 
the amount of human capital they have and in the kinds of work they are able 
and willing to do. The wage differences we observe in the economy are, to some 
extent, attributable to the determinants of equilibrium wages we discussed in the 
preceding section. Simply observing differences in wages among broad groups—
whites and blacks, men and women—does not prove that employers discriminate.
Consider, for example, the role of human capital. Among male workers, whites 
are about 75 percent more likely to have a college degree than blacks. Thus, at 
least some of the difference between the wages of whites and the wages of blacks 
can be traced to differences in educational attainment. Among white workers, 
men and women are now about equally likely to have a college degree, but men 
are about 11 percent more likely to earn a graduate or professional degree after 
college, indicating that some of the wage differential between men and women is 
also attributable to educational attainment.
Moreover, human capital may be more important in explaining wage differen-
tials than measures of years of schooling suggest. Historically, public schools in 
predominantly black areas have been of lower quality—as measured by expendi-
ture, class size, and so on—than public schools in predominantly white areas. 
Similarly, for many years, schools directed girls away from science and math 
courses, even though these subjects may have had greater value in the market-
place than some of the alternatives. If we could measure the quality as well as 
the quantity of education, the differences in human capital among these groups 
would seem even larger.
Human capital acquired in the form of job experience can also help explain 
wage differences. In particular, women tend to have less job experience on aver-
age compared to men. One reason is that female labor-force participation has 
increased over the past several decades. Because of this historic change, the 
average female worker today is younger than the average male worker. In addi-
tion, women are more likely to interrupt their careers to raise children. For both 
reasons, the average female worker has less job experience than the average male 
worker.
Yet another source of wage differences is compensating differentials. Men 
and women do not always choose the same type of work, and this fact may help 
explain some of the earnings differential between men and women. For example, 
women are more likely to be secretaries, and men are more likely to be truck 
drivers. The relative wages of secretaries and truck drivers depend in part on the 
working conditions of each job. Because these nonmonetary aspects are hard to 
measure, it is difficult to gauge the practical importance of compensating differ-
entials in explaining the wage differences that we observe. 
In the end, the study of wage differences among groups does not establish any 
clear conclusion about the prevalence of discrimination in U.S. labor markets. 
Most economists believe that some of the observed wage differentials are attribut-
able to discrimination, but there is no consensus about how much. The only con-
clusion about which economists are in consensus is a negative one: Because the 
differences in average wages among groups in part reflect differences in human 
capital and job characteristics, they do not by themselves say anything about how 
much discrimination there is in the labor market.

CHAPTER 19    Earnings and Discrimination
Of course, differences in human capital among groups of workers may them-
selves reflect discrimination. The less rigorous curriculums historically offered 
to female students, for instance, can be considered a discriminatory practice. 
Similarly, the inferior schools historically available to black students may be 
traced to prejudice on the part of city councils and school boards. But this kind of 
discrimination occurs long before the worker enters the labor market. In this case, 
the disease is political, even if the symptom is economic.
Is Emily More Employable than Lakisha?
Although measuring the extent of discrimination from labor-market outcomes is 
hard, some compelling evidence for the existence of such discrimination comes 
from a creative “field experiment.” Economists Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil 
Mullainathan answered more than 1,300 help-wanted ads run in Boston and 
Chicago newspapers by sending in nearly 5,000 fake résumés. Half of the résu-
més had names that were common in the African-American community, such as 
Lakisha Washington or Jamal Jones. The other half had names that were more 
common among the white population, such as Emily Walsh and Greg Baker. 
Otherwise, the résumés were similar. The results of this experiment were published 
in the American Economic Review in September 2004. 
	
The researchers found large differences in how employers responded to the two 
groups of résumés. Job applicants with white names received about 50 percent more 
calls from interested employers than applicants with African-American names. The 
study found that this discrimination occurred for all types of employers, including 
those who claimed to be an “Equal Opportunity Employer” in their help-wanted 
ads. The researchers concluded that “racial discrimination is still a prominent 
feature of the labor market.” ■
Discrimination by Employers
Let’s now turn from measurement to the economic forces that lie behind dis-
crimination in labor markets. If one group in society receives a lower wage than 
another group, even after controlling for human capital and job characteristics, 
who is to blame for this differential?
The answer is not obvious. It might seem natural to blame employers for dis-
criminatory wage differences. After all, employers make the hiring decisions that 
determine labor demand and wages. If some groups of workers earn lower wages 
than they should, then it seems that employers are responsible. Yet many econo-
mists are skeptical of this easy answer. They believe that competitive, market 
economies provide a natural antidote to employer discrimination. That antidote 
is called the profit motive.
Imagine an economy in which workers are differentiated by their hair color. 
Blondes and brunettes have the same skills, experience, and work ethic. Yet 
because of discrimination, employers prefer not to hire workers with blonde hair. 
Thus, the demand for blondes is lower than it otherwise would be. As a result, 
blondes earn a lower wage than brunettes. 
How long can this wage differential persist? In this economy, there is an easy 
way for a firm to beat out its competitors: It can hire blonde workers. By hiring 
blondes, a firm pays lower wages and thus has lower costs than firms that hire 
brunettes. Over time, more and more “blonde” firms enter the market to take

advantage of this cost advantage. The existing “brunette” firms have higher costs 
and, therefore, begin to lose money when faced with the new competitors. These 
losses induce the brunette firms to go out of business. Eventually, the entry of 
blonde firms and the exit of brunette firms cause the demand for blonde workers 
to rise and the demand for brunette workers to fall. This process continues until 
the wage differential disappears. 
Put simply, business owners who care only about making money are at an 
advantage when competing against those who also care about discriminating. As 
a result, firms that do not discriminate tend to replace those that do. In this way, 
competitive markets have a natural remedy for employer discrimination.  
Segregated Streetcars and the Profit Motive
In the early 20th century, streetcars in many southern cities were segregated by 
race. White passengers sat in the front of the streetcars, and black passengers sat 
in the back. What do you suppose caused and maintained this discriminatory 
practice? And how was this practice viewed by the firms that ran the streetcars?
	
In a 1986 article in the Journal of Economic History, economic historian Jennifer 
Roback looked at these questions. Roback found that the segregation of races on 
streetcars was the result of laws that required such segregation. Before these laws 
were passed, racial discrimination in seating was rare. It was far more common to 
segregate smokers and nonsmokers. 
	
Moreover, the firms that ran the streetcars often opposed the laws requiring 
racial segregation. Providing separate seating for different races raised the firms’ 
costs and reduced their profit. One railroad company manager complained to the 
city council that, under the segregation laws, “the company has to haul around a 
good deal of empty space.”
	
Here is how Roback describes the situation in one southern city:
The railroad company did not initiate the segregation policy and was not at all 
eager to abide by it. State legislation, public agitation, and a threat to arrest the 
president of the railroad were all required to induce them to separate the races 
on their cars. . . . There is no indication that the management was motivated 
by belief in civil rights or racial equality. The evidence indicates their primary 
motives were economic; separation was costly. . . . Officials of the company 
may or may not have disliked blacks, but they were not willing to forgo the 
profits necessary to indulge such prejudice.
	
The story of southern streetcars illustrates a general lesson: Business owners 
are usually more interested in making profit than in discriminating against a par-
ticular group. When firms engage in discriminatory practices, the ultimate source 
of the discrimination often lies not with the firms themselves but elsewhere. In 
this particular case, the streetcar companies segregated whites and blacks because 
discriminatory laws, which the companies opposed, required them to do so.  ■
Discrimination by Customers and Governments 
The profit motive is a strong force acting to eliminate discriminatory wage dif-
ferentials, but there are limits to its corrective abilities. Two important limiting 
factors are customer preferences and government policies.
To see how customer preferences for discrimination can affect wages, con-
sider again our imaginary economy with blondes and brunettes. Suppose that 
restaurant owners discriminate against blondes when hiring waiters. As a result,

CHAPTER 19    Earnings and Discrimination
blonde waiters earn lower wages than brunette waiters. In this case, a restaurant 
can open up with blonde waiters and charge lower prices. If customers care only 
about the quality and price of their meals, the discriminatory firms will be driven 
out of business, and the wage differential will disappear.
On the other hand, it is possible that customers prefer being served by brunette 
waiters. If this preference for discrimination is strong, the entry of blonde restau-
rants need not succeed in eliminating the wage differential between brunettes 
and blondes. That is, if customers have discriminatory preferences, a competitive 
market is consistent with a discriminatory wage differential. An economy with 
such discrimination would contain two types of restaurants. Blonde restaurants 
hire blondes, have lower costs, and charge lower prices. Brunette restaurants hire 
brunettes, have higher costs, and charge higher prices. Customers who did not 
care about the hair color of their waiters would be attracted to the lower prices at 
the blonde restaurants. Bigoted customers would go to the brunette restaurants 
and would pay for their discriminatory preference in the form of higher prices.
Another way for discrimination to persist in competitive markets is for the 
government to mandate discriminatory practices. If, for instance, the government 
passed a law stating that blondes could wash dishes in restaurants but could not 
work as waiters, then a wage differential could persist in a competitive market. 
The example of segregated streetcars in the foregoing case study is one example of 
government-mandated discrimination. More recently, before South Africa aban-
doned its system of apartheid, blacks were prohibited from working in some jobs. 
Discriminatory governments pass such laws to suppress the normal equalizing 
force of free and competitive markets.  
To sum up: Competitive markets contain a natural remedy for employer discrimina-
tion. The entry into the market of firms that care only about profit tends to eliminate 
discriminatory wage differentials. These wage differentials persist in competitive markets 
only when customers are willing to pay to maintain the discriminatory practice or when 
the government mandates it. 
Discrimination in Sports
As we have seen, measuring discrimination is often difficult. To determine 
whether one group of workers is discriminated against, a researcher must correct 
for differences in the productivity between that group and other workers in the 
economy. Yet in most firms, it is difficult to measure a particular worker’s contri-
bution to the production of goods and services.
	
One type of firm in which such corrections are easier is the sports team. 
Professional teams have many objective measures of productivity. In baseball, for 
instance, we can measure a player’s batting average, the frequency of home runs, 
the number of stolen bases, and so on.
	
Studies of sports teams suggest that racial discrimination is, in fact, common 
and that much of the blame lies with customers. One study, published in the 
Journal of Labor Economics in 1988, examined the salaries of basketball players and 
found that black players earned 20 percent less than white players of comparable 
ability. The study also found that attendance at basketball games was larger for 
teams with a greater proportion of white players. One interpretation of these facts 
is that, at least at the time of the study, customer discrimination made black play-
ers less profitable than white players for team owners. In the presence of such 
customer discrimination, a discriminatory wage gap can persist, even if team 
owners care only about profit.

The Difference 
between Men and 
Women, Revisited: It’s 
about Competition
By Hal R. Varian
G
ender differences are a topic of end-
less discussion for parents, teachers 
and social scientists. . . . A noteworthy 
case in point is a recent National Bureau 
of Economic Research working paper by a 
Stanford economist, Muriel Niederle, and 
Lise Vesterlund, a University of Pittsburgh 
economist, titled, “Do Women Shy Away 
From Competition? Do Men Compete Too 
Much?”
It is widely noted that women are not 
well represented in high-paying corporate 
jobs, or in mathematics, science and engi-
neering jobs. As the authors observe, the 
“standard economic explanations for such 
occupational differences include prefer-
ences, ability and discrimination.”
To this list the authors add a new factor: 
attitudes toward competitive environments. 
If men prefer more competitive environ-
ments than women, then there will be more 
men represented in areas where competi-
tion is intense.
Of course, discussions of gender differ-
ences of any sort can only be statements about 
averages; it is clear that there are women who 
thrive in competitive environments and men 
who do not. Furthermore, attitudes toward 
competition may be ingrained or a result of 
factors like social stereotyping.
Is there any evidence that the hypothe­
sis is true? Do men really prefer more 
competitive environments than women? 
One could cite anecdote after anecdote, 
but the authors took a much more direct 
approach: they ran an experiment.
By using an experiment, the authors 
were able to determine not only whether 
men and women differ in their willingness 
to compete, but more important, whether 
they differ in their willingness to compete 
conditioned on their actual performance.
 Gender Differences
Recent economic research is shedding light on why men and women 
choose different career paths.

A similar situation once existed for baseball players. A study using data from 
the late 1960s showed that black players earned less than comparable white play-
ers. Moreover, fewer fans attended games pitched by blacks than games pitched 
by whites, even though black pitchers had better records than white pitchers. 
Studies of more recent salaries in baseball, however, have found no evidence of 
discriminatory wage differentials.
	
Another study, published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1990, exam-
ined the market prices of old baseball cards. This study found similar evidence of 
discrimination. The cards of black hitters sold for 10 percent less than the cards 
of comparable white hitters, and the cards of black pitchers sold for 13 percent 
less than the cards of comparable white pitchers. These results suggest customer 
discrimination among baseball fans.  ■

CHAPTER 19    Earnings and Discrimination
Conclusion
 In competitive markets, workers earn a wage equal to the value of their marginal 
contribution to the production of goods and services. There are, however, many 
things that affect the value of the marginal product. Firms pay more for work-
ers who are more talented, more diligent, more experienced, and more educated 
because these workers are more productive. Firms pay less to those workers 
against whom customers discriminate because these workers contribute less to 
revenue. 
The theory of the labor market we have developed in the last two chapters 
explains why some workers earn higher wages than other workers. The theory 
does not say that the resulting distribution of income is equal, fair, or desirable in 
any way. That is the topic we take up in Chapter 20.
Source: New York Times, March 9, 2006.
The economists asked 80 subjects, 
divided into groups of two women and 
two men, to add up sets of five two-digit 
numbers for five minutes. The subjects 
performed the task first on a piece-rate 
basis (50 cents for each correct answer) 
and then as a tournament (the person 
with the most correct answers in each 
group received $2 per correct answer, 
while other participants received nothing). 
Note that a subject with a 25 percent 
chance of being a winner in the tourna-
ment received the same average payment 
as in the piece-rate system.
All participants were told how many 
problems they got right, but not their rela-
tive performance. After completing the two 
tasks, the subjects were asked to choose 
whether they preferred a piece-rate sys-
tem or a tournament for the third set of 
problems.
There were several interesting findings 
in this experiment. First, there were no dif-
ferences between men and women in their 
performance under either compensation 
system. Despite this, twice as many men 
selected the tournament as women (75 
percent versus 35 percent). 
Even if one accounts for performance 
by comparing only men and women with 
the same number of correct answers, the 
women have a 38 percent lower probability 
of choosing the tournament compensation.
Why were the men much more likely 
to choose the tournament? Perhaps it was 
because they felt more confident about 
their abilities. The data support this hypoth-
esis, with 75 percent of the men believing 
that they won their four-player tournament, 
while 43 percent of the women thought 
they were best in their group.
Though both groups were overconfident 
about their performance, the men were 
much more so. . . . The results of this experi-
ment are consistent with the finding by a 
Berkeley finance professor, Terry Odean, 
that men trade stocks excessively, appar-
ently because they (wrongly) feel that they 
have exceptional ability to pick winners. 
Women trade less, but do better on aver-
age, because they are more likely to follow 
a buy-and-hold strategy.
The authors summarized their experi-
mental results by saying, “From a payoff-
maximizing perspective, high-performing 
women enter the tournament too rarely, 
and low-performing men enter the tour-
nament too often.” The low-performing 
men and the high-performing women 
are both hurt by this behavior but, in 
this experiment at least, the costs to the 
women who did not choose the tourna-
ment when they should have exceeded 
the costs to the men who should have 
avoided the tournament.
One should not read too much into one 
study. But if it is really true that women choose 
occupations that involve less competition, 
then one may well ask why. Sociobiologists 
may suggest that such differences come from 
genetic propensities; sociologists may argue 
for differences in social roles and expec-
tations; developmental psychologists may 
emphasize child-rearing practices. Whatever 
the cause, Ms. Niederle and Ms. Vesterlund 
have certainly raised a host of interesting and 
important questions.

The Economics of Labor Markets
Summary
• Workers earn different wages for many reasons. 
To some extent, wage differentials compensate 
workers for job attributes. Other things equal, 
workers in hard, unpleasant jobs are paid more 
than workers in easy, pleasant jobs.
• Workers with more human capital are paid more 
than workers with less human capital. The return 
to accumulating human capital is high and has 
increased over the past two decades.
• Although years of education, experience, and job 
characteristics affect earnings as theory predicts, 
there is much variation in earnings that cannot be 
explained by things that economists can measure. 
The unexplained variation in earnings is largely 
attributable to natural ability, effort, and chance.
• Some economists have suggested that more edu-
cated workers earn higher wages not because 
education raises productivity but because work-
ers with high natural ability use education as a 
way to signal their high ability to employers. If 
this signaling theory is correct, then increasing 
the educational attainment of all workers would 
not raise the overall level of wages.
• Wages are sometimes pushed above the level 
that brings supply and demand into balance. 
Three reasons for above-equilibrium wages are 
minimum-wage laws, unions, and efficiency 
wages.
• Some differences in earnings are attributable 
to discrimination based on race, sex, or other 
factors. Measuring the amount of discrimina-
tion is difficult, however, because one must 
correct for differences in human capital and job 
characteristics.
• Competitive markets tend to limit the impact of 
discrimination on wages. If the wages of a group 
of workers are lower than those of another group 
for reasons not related to marginal productiv-
ity, then nondiscriminatory firms will be more 
profitable than discriminatory firms. Profit-
maximizing behavior, therefore, can reduce dis-
criminatory wage differentials. Discrimination 
persists in competitive markets, however, if cus-
tomers are willing to pay more to discriminatory 
firms or if the government passes laws requiring 
firms to discriminate.

CHAPTER 19    Earnings and Discrimination
	 1.	 College students sometimes work as summer 
interns for private firms or the government. 
Many of these positions pay little or nothing.
	a.	 What is the opportunity cost of taking such a 
job?
	b.	Explain why students are willing to take 
these jobs.
	c.	 If you were to compare the earnings later  
in life of workers who had worked as  
interns and those who had taken summer 
jobs that paid more, what would you expect 
to find?
	 2.	 As explained in Chapter 6, a minimum-wage 
law distorts the market for low-wage labor.  
To reduce this distortion, some economists 
advocate a two-tiered minimum-wage system, 
with a regular minimum wage for adult  
workers and a lower, “subminimum” wage for 
teenage workers. Give two reasons a single  
minimum wage might distort the labor market 
for teenage workers more than it would the 
market for adult workers.
	 3.	 A basic finding of labor economics is that  
workers who have more experience in the labor 
force are paid more than workers who have 
less experience (holding constant the amount of 
formal education). Why might this be so? Some 
studies have also found that experience at the 
same job (called job tenure) has an extra positive 
influence on wages. Explain.
	 4.	 At some colleges and universities, economics 
professors receive higher salaries than  
professors in some other fields.
	a.	 Why might this be true?
	b.	Some other colleges and universities have a 
policy of paying equal salaries to professors 
in all fields. At some of these schools,  
economics professors have lighter teaching 
loads than professors in some other fields. 
What role do the differences in teaching 
loads play?
	 5.	 Imagine that someone offered you a choice: You 
could spend four years studying at the world’s 
best university, but you would have to keep 
your attendance there a secret. Or you could 
be awarded an official degree from the world’s 
best university, but you couldn’t actually  
attend. Which choice do you think would 
enhance your future earnings more? What  
does your answer say about the debate over 
signaling versus human capital in the role of 
education?
	 6.	 When recording devices were first invented 
almost 100 years ago, musicians could suddenly 
supply their music to large audiences at low 
cost. How do you suppose this development 
affected the income of the best musicians?  
How do you suppose it affected the income of 
average musicians?
	 7.	 A current debate in education is whether  
teachers should be paid on a standard pay scale 
based solely upon their years of training and 
teaching experience, or whether part of their 
salary should be based upon their performance 
(called “merit pay”).
	a. 	Why might merit pay be desirable?
	b. 	Who might be opposed to a system of merit 
pay?
	c. 	What is a potential challenge of merit pay?
	d.	A related issue: Why might a school district 
decide to pay teachers significantly more 
than the salaries offered by surrounding  
districts?
	 8.	 When Alan Greenspan (who would later 
become chairman of the Federal Reserve) ran 
an economic consulting firm in the 1960s, he 
primarily hired female economists. He once told 
the New York Times, “I always valued men and 
women equally, and I found that because others 
did not, good women economists were cheaper 
than men.” Is Greenspan’s behavior profit-
maximizing? Is it admirable or despicable? If 
more employers were like Greenspan, what 
would happen to the wage differential between 
men and women? Why might other economic 
consulting firms at the time not have followed 
Greenspan’s business strategy?
	 9.	 Suppose that all young women were channeled 
into careers as secretaries, nurses, and teachers; 
at the same time, young men were encouraged 
to consider these three careers and many others 
as well.
