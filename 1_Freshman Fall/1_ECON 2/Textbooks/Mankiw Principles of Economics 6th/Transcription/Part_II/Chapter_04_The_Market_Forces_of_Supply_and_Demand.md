The Market Forces of
    Supply and Demand
W
hen a cold snap hits Florida, the price of orange juice rises in supermar-
kets throughout the country. When the weather turns warm in New 
England every summer, the price of hotel rooms in the Caribbean plum-
mets. When a war breaks out in the Middle East, the price of gasoline 
in the United States rises, and the price of a used Cadillac falls. What do these events 
have in common? They all show the workings of supply and demand.
Supply and demand are the two words economists use most often—and for good 
reason. Supply and demand are the forces that make market economies work. 
They determine the quantity of each good produced and the price at which it is 
sold. If you want to know how any event or policy will affect the economy, you 
must think first about how it will affect supply and demand.
This chapter introduces the theory of supply and demand. It considers how 
buyers and sellers behave and how they interact with one another. It shows how 
supply and demand determine prices in a market economy and how prices, in 
turn, allocate the economy’s scarce resources.

PART II	
How Markets Work
Markets and Competition
The terms supply and demand refer to the behavior of people as they interact with 
one another in competitive markets. Before discussing how buyers and sellers 
behave, let’s first consider more fully what we mean by the terms market and 
competition. 
What Is a Market?
A market is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service. The buy-
ers as a group determine the demand for the product, and the sellers as a group 
determine the supply of the product. 
Markets take many forms. Some markets are highly organized, such as the 
markets for many agricultural commodities. In these markets, buyers and sellers 
meet at a specific time and place, where an auctioneer helps set prices and arrange 
sales. 
More often, markets are less organized. For example, consider the market for 
ice cream in a particular town. Buyers of ice cream do not meet together at any 
one time. The sellers of ice cream are in different locations and offer somewhat 
different products. There is no auctioneer calling out the price of ice cream. Each 
seller posts a price for an ice-cream cone, and each buyer decides how much ice 
cream to buy at each store. Nonetheless, these consumers and producers of ice 
cream are closely connected. The ice-cream buyers are choosing from the various 
ice-cream sellers to satisfy their cravings, and the ice-cream sellers are all trying 
to appeal to the same ice-cream buyers to make their businesses successful. Even 
though it is not as organized, the group of ice-cream buyers and ice-cream sellers 
forms a market. 
What Is Competition?
The market for ice cream, like most markets in the economy, is highly competitive. 
Each buyer knows that there are several sellers from which to choose, and each 
seller is aware that his or her product is similar to that offered by other sellers. As a 
result, the price of ice cream and the quantity of ice cream sold are not determined 
by any single buyer or seller. Rather, price and quantity are determined by all buy-
ers and sellers as they interact in the marketplace.
Economists use the term competitive market to describe a market in which 
there are so many buyers and so many sellers that each has a negligible impact 
on the market price. Each seller of ice cream has limited control over the price 
because other sellers are offering similar products. A seller has little reason 
to charge less than the going price, and if he or she charges more, buyers will 
make their purchases elsewhere. Similarly, no single buyer of ice cream can 
influence the price of ice cream because each buyer purchases only a small 
amount.
In this chapter, we assume that markets are perfectly competitive. To reach this 
highest form of competition, a market must have two characteristics: (1) the goods 
offered for sale are all exactly the same, and (2) the buyers and sellers are so 
numerous that no single buyer or seller has any influence over the market price. 
Because buyers and sellers in perfectly competitive markets must accept the price 
the market determines, they are said to be price takers. At the market price, buyers 
can buy all they want, and sellers can sell all they want.

CHAPTER 4    The Market Forces of Supply and Demand
There are some markets in which the assumption of perfect competition applies 
perfectly. In the wheat market, for example, there are thousands of farmers 
who sell wheat and millions of consumers who use wheat and wheat products. 
Because no single buyer or seller can influence the price of wheat, each takes the 
price as given.
Not all goods and services, however, are sold in perfectly competitive markets. 
Some markets have only one seller, and this seller sets the price. Such a seller is 
called a monopoly. Your local cable television company, for instance, may be a 
monopoly. Residents of your town probably have only one cable company from 
which to buy this service. Still other markets fall between the extremes of perfect 
competition and monopoly.
Despite the diversity of market types we find in the world, assuming perfect 
competition is a useful simplification and, therefore, a natural place to start. 
Perfectly competitive markets are the easiest to analyze because everyone par-
ticipating in the market takes the price as given by market conditions. Moreover, 
because some degree of competition is present in most markets, many of the les-
sons that we learn by studying supply and demand under perfect competition 
apply in more complicated markets as well.

tive market?
Demand
We begin our study of markets by examining the behavior of buyers. To focus our 
thinking, let’s keep in mind a particular good—ice cream.
The Demand Curve: The Relationship between  
Price and Quantity Demanded
The quantity demanded of any good is the amount of the good that buyers 
are willing and able to purchase. As we will see, many things determine the 
quantity demanded of any good, but in our analysis of how markets work, one 
determinant plays a central role—the price of the good. If the price of ice cream 
rose to $20 per scoop, you would buy less ice cream. You might buy frozen 
yogurt instead. If the price of ice cream fell to $0.20 per scoop, you would buy 
more. This relationship between price and quantity demanded is true for most 
goods in the economy and, in fact, is so pervasive that economists call it the 
law of demand: Other things equal, when the price of a good rises, the quantity 
demanded of the good falls, and when the price falls, the quantity demanded 
rises. 
The table in Figure 1 shows how many ice-cream cones Catherine buys each 
month at different prices of ice cream. If ice cream is free, Catherine eats 12 cones 
per month. At $0.50 per cone, Catherine buys 10 cones each month. As the price 
rises further, she buys fewer and fewer cones. When the price reaches $3.00, 
Catherine doesn’t buy any ice cream at all. This table is a demand schedule, a 
table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity 
demanded, holding constant everything else that influences how much of the 
good consumers want to buy.

PART II	
How Markets Work
The graph in Figure 1 uses the numbers from the table to illustrate the law 
of demand. By convention, the price of ice cream is on the vertical axis, and the 
quantity of ice cream demanded is on the horizontal axis. The downward-sloping 
line relating price and quantity demanded is called the demand curve. 
Market Demand versus Individual Demand
The demand curve in Figure 1 shows an individual’s demand for a product. To 
analyze how markets work, we need to determine the market demand, the sum of 
all the individual demands for a particular good or service.
The table in Figure 2 shows the demand schedules for ice cream of the two 
individuals in this market—Catherine and Nicholas. At any price, Catherine’s 
demand schedule tells us how much ice cream she buys, and Nicholas’s demand 
schedule tells us how much ice cream he buys. The market demand at each price 
is the sum of the two individual demands.
The graph in Figure 2 shows the demand curves that correspond to these 
demand schedules. Notice that we sum the individual demand curves horizon­
tally to obtain the market demand curve. That is, to find the total quantity 
demanded at any price, we add the individual quantities, which are found on 
the horizontal axis of the individual demand curves. Because we are interested in 
analyzing how markets function, we work most often with the market demand 
curve. The market demand curve shows how the total quantity demanded of a 
demand curve

relationship between the 
price of a good and the 
quantity demanded
The demand schedule is a table that shows the quantity demanded at each price. 
The demand curve, which graphs the demand schedule, illustrates how the quantity 
demanded of the good changes as its price varies. Because a lower price increases the 
quantity demanded, the demand curve slopes downward.

good varies as the price of the good varies, while all the other factors that affect 
how much consumers want to buy are held constant. 
Shifts in the Demand Curve
Because the market demand curve holds other things constant, it need not be 
stable over time. If something happens to alter the quantity demanded at any 
given price, the demand curve shifts. For example, suppose the American Medi-
cal Association discovered that people who regularly eat ice cream live longer, 
healthier lives. The discovery would raise the demand for ice cream. At any given 
price, buyers would now want to purchase a larger quantity of ice cream, and the 
demand curve for ice cream would shift. 
Figure 3 illustrates shifts in demand. Any change that increases the quantity 
demanded at every price, such as our imaginary discovery by the American Medi-
cal Association, shifts the demand curve to the right and is called an increase in 
demand. Any change that reduces the quantity demanded at every price shifts the 
demand curve to the left and is called a decrease in demand.
There are many variables that can shift the demand curve. Here are the most 
important.
Market Demand as the 
Sum of Individual Demands
Figure 2
The quantity demanded in a market is the sum of the quantities demanded by all the 
buyers at each price. Thus, the market demand curve is found by adding horizontally 
the individual demand curves. At a price of $2.00, Catherine demands 4 ice-cream 
cones, and Nicholas demands 3 ice-cream cones. The quantity demanded in the 
market at this price is 7 cones.

PART II	
How Markets Work
Income  What would happen to your demand for ice cream if you lost your 
job one summer? Most likely, it would fall. A lower income means that you have 
less to spend in total, so you would have to spend less on some—and probably 
most—goods. If the demand for a good falls when income falls, the good is called 
a normal good.
Not all goods are normal goods. If the demand for a good rises when income 
falls, the good is called an inferior good. An example of an inferior good might be 
bus rides. As your income falls, you are less likely to buy a car or take a cab and 
more likely to ride a bus.
Prices of Related Goods  Suppose that the price of frozen yogurt falls. The 
law of demand says that you will buy more frozen yogurt. At the same time, 
you will probably buy less ice cream. Because ice cream and frozen yogurt are 
both cold, sweet, creamy desserts, they satisfy similar desires. When a fall in the 
price of one good reduces the demand for another good, the two goods are called 
­substitutes. Substitutes are often pairs of goods that are used in place of each 
other, such as hot dogs and hamburgers, sweaters and sweatshirts, and movie 
tickets and DVD rentals.
Now suppose that the price of hot fudge falls. According to the law of demand, 
you will buy more hot fudge. Yet in this case, you will buy more ice cream as 
well because ice cream and hot fudge are often used together. When a fall in the 
price of one good raises the demand for another good, the two goods are called 
­complements. Complements are often pairs of goods that are used together, such 
as gasoline and automobiles, computers and software, and peanut butter and jelly.
Tastes  The most obvious determinant of your demand is your tastes. If you like 
ice cream, you buy more of it. Economists normally do not try to explain people’s 
tastes because tastes are based on historical and psychological forces that are 
beyond the realm of economics. Economists do, however, examine what happens 
when tastes change.

CHAPTER 4    The Market Forces of Supply and Demand
Expectations  Your expectations about the future may affect your demand for 
a good or service today. If you expect to earn a higher income next month, you 
may choose to save less now and spend more of your current income buying ice 
cream. If you expect the price of ice cream to fall tomorrow, you may be less will-
ing to buy an ice-cream cone at today’s price.
Number of Buyers  In addition to the preceding factors, which influence the 
behavior of individual buyers, market demand depends on the number of these 
buyers. If Peter were to join Catherine and Nicholas as another consumer of ice 
cream, the quantity demanded in the market would be higher at every price, and 
market demand would increase.
Summary  The demand curve shows what happens to the quantity demanded of 
a good when its price varies, holding constant all the other variables that influence 
buyers. When one of these other variables changes, the demand curve shifts. Table 
1 lists the variables that influence how much consumers choose to buy of a good. 
If you have trouble remembering whether you need to shift or move along the 
demand curve, it helps to recall a lesson from the appendix to Chapter 2. A curve 
shifts when there is a change in a relevant variable that is not measured on either 
axis. Because the price is on the vertical axis, a change in price represents a move-
ment along the demand curve. By contrast, income, the prices of related goods, 
tastes, expectations, and the number of buyers are not measured on either axis, so 
a change in one of these variables shifts the demand curve.
Two Ways to Reduce the Quantity  
of Smoking Demanded
Public policymakers often want to reduce the amount that people smoke because 
of smoking’s adverse health effects. There are two ways that policy can attempt 
to achieve this goal.
	
One way to reduce smoking is to shift the demand curve for cigarettes and other 
tobacco products. Public service announcements, mandatory health warnings on 
cigarette packages, and the prohibition of cigarette advertising on ­tele­vision are 
all policies aimed at reducing the quantity of cigarettes demanded at any given 
price. If successful, these policies shift the demand curve for cigarettes to the left, 
as in panel (a) of Figure 4. 
Variables That Influence Buyers
This table lists the variables that 
affect how much consumers choose 
to buy of any good. Notice the 
special role that the price of the 
good plays: A change in the good’s 
price represents a movement 
along the demand curve, whereas 
a change in one of the other 
variables shifts the demand curve.

PART II	
How Markets Work
	
Alternatively, policymakers can try to raise the price of cigarettes. If the gov-
ernment taxes the manufacture of cigarettes, for example, cigarette companies 
pass much of this tax on to consumers in the form of higher prices. A higher price 
encourages smokers to reduce the numbers of cigarettes they smoke. In this case, 
the reduced amount of smoking does not represent a shift in the demand curve. 
Instead, it represents a movement along the same demand curve to a point with a 
higher price and lower quantity, as in panel (b) of Figure 4.
	
How much does the amount of smoking respond to changes in the price of 
cigarettes? Economists have attempted to answer this question by studying what 
happens when the tax on cigarettes changes. They have found that a 10 percent 
increase in the price causes a 4 percent reduction in the quantity demanded. 
Teenagers are found to be especially sensitive to the price of cigarettes: A 10 per-
cent increase in the price causes a 12 percent drop in teenage smoking.
	
A related question is how the price of cigarettes affects the demand for illicit 
drugs, such as marijuana. Opponents of cigarette taxes often argue that tobacco 
and marijuana are substitutes so that high cigarette prices encourage marijuana 
use. By contrast, many experts on substance abuse view tobacco as a “gateway 
drug” leading the young to experiment with other harmful substances. Most stud-
ies of the data are consistent with this latter view: They find that lower cigarette 
prices are associated with greater use of marijuana. In other words, tobacco and 
marijuana appear to be complements rather than substitutes.  ■
Figure 4
If warnings on cigarette packages convince smokers to smoke less, the demand curve 
for cigarettes shifts to the left. In panel (a), the demand curve shifts from D1 to D2. At 
a price of $2.00 per pack, the quantity demanded falls from 20 to 10 cigarettes per 
day, as reflected by the shift from point A to point B. By contrast, if a tax raises the 
price of cigarettes, the demand curve does not shift. Instead, we observe a movement 
to a different point on the demand curve. In panel (b), when the price rises from $2.00 
to $4.00, the quantity demanded falls from 20 to 12 cigarettes per day, as reflected by 
the movement from point A to point C.

Quick Quiz  Make up an example of a monthly demand schedule for pizza and 
graph the implied demand curve. • Give an example of something that would shift 
this demand curve, and briefly explain your reasoning. • Would a change in the price 
of pizza shift this demand curve?
Supply
We now turn to the other side of the market and examine the behavior of sellers. 
Once again, to focus our thinking, let’s consider the market for ice cream.
The Supply Curve: The Relationship between Price 
and Quantity Supplied
The quantity supplied of any good or service is the amount that sellers are 
willing and able to sell. There are many determinants of quantity supplied, 
but once again, price plays a special role in our analysis. When the price of 
ice cream is high, selling ice cream is profitable, and so the quantity supplied 
is large. Sellers of ice cream work long hours, buy many ice-cream machines, 
and hire many workers. By contrast, when the price of ice cream is low, the 
business is less profitable, so sellers produce less ice cream. At a low price, 
some sellers may even choose to shut down, and their quantity supplied falls 
to zero. This relationship between price and quantity supplied is called the 
law of supply: Other things equal, when the price of a good rises, the quantity 
supplied of the good also rises, and when the price falls, the quantity supplied 
falls as well.
The table in Figure 5 shows the quantity of ice-cream cones supplied each 
month by Ben, an ice-cream seller, at various prices of ice cream. At a price below 
$1.00, Ben does not supply any ice cream at all. As the price rises, he supplies 
a greater and greater quantity. This is the supply schedule, a table that shows 
the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied, holding 
constant everything else that influences how much producers of the good want 
to sell.
The graph in Figure 5 uses the numbers from the table to illustrate the law 
of supply. The curve relating price and quantity supplied is called the supply 
curve. The supply curve slopes upward because, other things equal, a higher price 
means a greater quantity supplied. 
Market Supply versus Individual Supply
Just as market demand is the sum of the demands of all buyers, market supply is 
the sum of the supplies of all sellers. The table in Figure 6 shows the supply sched-
ules for the two ice-cream producers in the market—Ben and Jerry. At any price, 
Ben’s supply schedule tells us the quantity of ice cream Ben supplies, and Jerry’s 
supply schedule tells us the quantity of ice cream Jerry supplies. The market sup-
ply is the sum of the two individual supplies.
The graph in Figure 6 shows the supply curves that correspond to the supply 
schedules. As with demand curves, we sum the individual supply curves horizon-
tally to obtain the market supply curve. That is, to find the total quantity supplied 
at any price, we add the individual quantities, which are found on the horizontal 
axis of the individual supply curves. The market supply curve shows how the

PART II	
How Markets Work
total quantity supplied varies as the price of the good varies, holding constant 
all the other factors beyond price that influence producers’ decisions about how 
much to sell.
Shifts in the Supply Curve
Because the market supply curve holds other things constant, the curve shifts 
when one of the factors changes. For example, suppose the price of sugar falls. 
Sugar is an input into producing ice cream, so the fall in the price of sugar makes 
selling ice cream more profitable. This raises the supply of ice cream: At any given 
price, sellers are now willing to produce a larger quantity. The supply curve for 
ice cream shifts to the right.
Figure 7 illustrates shifts in supply. Any change that raises quantity supplied at 
every price, such as a fall in the price of sugar, shifts the supply curve to the right 
and is called an increase in supply. Similarly, any change that reduces the quantity 
supplied at every price shifts the supply curve to the left and is called a decrease 
in supply.
There are many variables that can shift the supply curve. Here are some of the 
most important.
Input Prices  To produce their output of ice cream, sellers use various inputs: 
cream, sugar, flavoring, ice-cream machines, the buildings in which the ice

CHAPTER 4    The Market Forces of Supply and Demand
Market Supply as the Sum 
of Individual Supplies
Figure 6
The quantity supplied in a market is the sum of the quantities supplied by all the 
sellers at each price. Thus, the market supply curve is found by adding horizontally the 
individual supply curves. At a price of $2.00, Ben supplies 3 ice-cream cones, and Jerry 
supplies 4 ice-cream cones. The quantity supplied in the market at this price is 7 cones.

Shifts in the Supply Curve
Any change that raises the 
quantity that sellers wish to 
produce at any given price 
shifts the supply curve to 
the right. Any change that 
lowers the quantity that 
sellers wish to produce at 
any given price shifts the 
supply curve to the left.

PART II	
How Markets Work
ice cream is less profitable, and firms supply less ice cream. If input prices rise 
substantially, a firm might shut down and supply no ice cream at all. Thus, the 
supply of a good is negatively related to the price of the inputs used to make 
the good.
Technology  The technology for turning inputs into ice cream is another 
determinant of supply. The invention of the mechanized ice-cream machine, for 
example, reduced the amount of labor necessary to make ice cream. By reducing 
firms’ costs, the advance in technology raised the supply of ice cream.
Expectations  The amount of ice cream a firm supplies today may depend on 
its expectations about the future. For example, if a firm expects the price of ice 
cream to rise in the future, it will put some of its current production into storage 
and supply less to the market today.
Number of Sellers  In addition to the preceding factors, which influence the 
behavior of individual sellers, market supply depends on the number of these 
sellers. If Ben or Jerry were to retire from the ice-cream business, the supply in 
the market would fall.
Summary  The supply curve shows what happens to the quantity supplied 
of a good when its price varies, holding constant all the other variables that 
influence sellers. When one of these other variables changes, the supply curve 
shifts. Table 2 lists the variables that influence how much producers choose to 
sell of a good.
Once again, to remember whether you need to shift or move along the supply 
curve, keep in mind that a curve shifts only when there is a change in a relevant 
variable that is not named on either axis. The price is on the vertical axis, so a 
change in price represents a movement along the supply curve. By contrast, 
because input prices, technology, expectations, and the number of sellers are 
not measured on either axis, a change in one of these variables shifts the supply 
curve.
Quick Quiz  Make up an example of a monthly supply schedule for pizza and graph 
the implied supply curve. • Give an example of something that would shift this supply 
curve, and briefly explain your reasoning. • Would a change in the price of pizza shift 
this supply curve?
Variables That Influence Sellers
This table lists the variables that affect how 
much producers choose to sell of any good. 
Notice the special role that the price of the 
good plays: A change in the good’s price 
represents a movement along the supply 
curve, whereas a change in one of the other 
variables shifts the supply curve.

CHAPTER 4    The Market Forces of Supply and Demand
Supply and Demand Together
Having analyzed supply and demand separately, we now combine them to see 
how they determine the price and quantity of a good sold in a market.
Equilibrium
Figure 8 shows the market supply curve and market demand curve together. 
Notice that there is one point at which the supply and demand curves intersect. 
This point is called the market’s equilibrium. The price at this intersection is 
called the equilibrium price, and the quantity is called the equilibrium quantity. 
Here the equilibrium price is $2.00 per cone, and the equilibrium quantity is 7 ice-
cream cones. 
The dictionary defines the word equilibrium as a situation in which various 
forces are in balance—and this also describes a market’s equilibrium. At the equi-
librium price, the quantity of the good that buyers are willing and able to buy exactly 
balances the quantity that sellers are willing and able to sell. The equilibrium price is 
sometimes called the market-clearing price because, at this price, everyone in the 
market has been satisfied: Buyers have bought all they want to buy, and sellers 
have sold all they want to sell. 
The actions of buyers and sellers naturally move markets toward the equilib-
rium of supply and demand. To see why, consider what happens when the mar-
ket price is not equal to the equilibrium price.
Suppose first that the market price is above the equilibrium price, as in panel (a) 
of Figure 9. At a price of $2.50 per cone, the quantity of the good supplied (10 cones) 
exceeds the quantity demanded (4 cones). There is a surplus of the good: Suppliers 
are unable to sell all they want at the going price. A surplus is sometimes called a 
situation of excess supply. When there is a surplus in the ice-cream market, sellers 
of ice cream find their freezers increasingly full of ice cream they would like to sell

The Equilibrium of Supply 
and Demand
The equilibrium is found 
where the supply and 
demand curves intersect. At 
the equilibrium price, the 
quantity supplied equals 
the quantity demanded. 
Here the equilibrium price 
is $2.00: At this price, 7 ice-
cream cones are supplied, 
and 7 ice-cream cones are 
demanded.

PART II	
How Markets Work
but cannot. They respond to the surplus by cutting their prices. Falling prices, in 
turn, increase the quantity demanded and decrease the quantity supplied. These 
changes represent movements along the supply and demand curves, not shifts in 
the curves. Prices continue to fall until the market reaches the equilibrium.
Suppose now that the market price is below the equilibrium price, as in panel 
(b) of Figure 9. In this case, the price is $1.50 per cone, and the quantity of the 
good demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. There is a shortage of the good: 
Demanders are unable to buy all they want at the going price. A shortage is some-
times called a situation of excess demand. When a shortage occurs in the ice-cream 
market, buyers have to wait in long lines for a chance to buy one of the few cones 
available. With too many buyers chasing too few goods, sellers can respond to the 
shortage by raising their prices without losing sales. These price increases cause 
the quantity demanded to fall and the quantity supplied to rise. Once again, these 
changes represent movements along the supply and demand curves, and they 
move the market toward the equilibrium.
Thus, regardless of whether the price starts off too high or too low, the activi-
ties of the many buyers and sellers automatically push the market price toward 
the equilibrium price. Once the market reaches its equilibrium, all buyers and 
sellers are satisfied, and there is no upward or downward pressure on the price. 
How quickly equilibrium is reached varies from market to market depending 
on how quickly prices adjust. In most free markets, surpluses and shortages are 
only temporary because prices eventually move toward their equilibrium levels.

quantity demanded is

Figure 9
In panel (a), there is a surplus. Because the market price of $2.50 is above the 
equilibrium price, the quantity supplied (10 cones) exceeds the quantity demanded 
(4 cones). Suppliers try to increase sales by cutting the price of a cone, and this moves 
the price toward its equilibrium level. In panel (b), there is a shortage. Because the 
market price of $1.50 is below the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded (10 
cones) exceeds the quantity supplied (4 cones). With too many buyers chasing too few 
goods, suppliers can take advantage of the shortage by raising the price. Hence, in 
both cases, the price adjustment moves the market toward the equilibrium of supply 
and demand.

CHAPTER 4    The Market Forces of Supply and Demand
Indeed, this phenomenon is so pervasive that it is called the law of supply and 
demand: The price of any good adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and quan-
tity demanded for that good into balance.
Three Steps to Analyzing Changes in Equilibrium
So far, we have seen how supply and demand together determine a market’s equi-
librium, which in turn determines the price and quantity of the good that buyers 
purchase and sellers produce. The equilibrium price and quantity depend on the 
position of the supply and demand curves. When some event shifts one of these 
curves, the equilibrium in the market changes, resulting in a new price and a new 
quantity exchanged between buyers and sellers. 
When analyzing how some event affects the equilibrium in a market, we proceed 
in three steps. First, we decide whether the event shifts the supply curve, the demand 
curve, or, in some cases, both curves. Second, we decide whether the curve shifts to 
the right or to the left. Third, we use the supply-and-demand diagram to compare 
the initial and the new equilibrium, which shows how the shift affects the equilib-
rium price and quantity. Table 3 summarizes these three steps. To see how this recipe 
is used, let’s consider various events that might affect the market for ice cream.
Example: A Change in Market Equilibrium Due to a Shift in Demand 
Suppose that one summer the weather is very hot. How does this event affect the 
market for ice cream? To answer this question, let’s follow our three steps.
	 1.	 The hot weather affects the demand curve by changing people’s taste for 
ice cream. That is, the weather changes the amount of ice cream that people 
want to buy at any given price. The supply curve is unchanged because the 
weather does not directly affect the firms that sell ice cream. 
	 2.	 Because hot weather makes people want to eat more ice cream, the demand 
curve shifts to the right. Figure 10 shows this increase in demand as the shift 
in the demand curve from D1 to D2. This shift indicates that the quantity of 
ice cream demanded is higher at every price.
	 3.	 At the old price of $2, there is now an excess demand for ice cream, and this 
shortage induces firms to raise the price. As Figure 10 shows, the increase in 
demand raises the equilibrium price from $2.00 to $2.50 and the equilibrium 
quantity from 7 to 10 cones. In other words, the hot weather increases the 
price of ice cream and the quantity of ice cream sold.
Shifts in Curves versus Movements along Curves  Notice that when hot 
weather increases the demand for ice cream and drives up the price, the quantity 
of ice cream that firms supply rises, even though the supply curve remains the 
law of supply and 
demand
the claim that the price of 
any good adjusts to bring 
the quantity supplied and 
the quantity demanded 
for that good into balance
Three Steps for 
Analyzing Changes in 
Equilibrium

shifts the supply or demand 
curve (or perhaps both).

shift changes the equilib-
rium price and quantity.

How Markets Work
same. In this case, economists say there has been an increase in “quantity sup-
plied” but no change in “supply.”
Supply refers to the position of the supply curve, whereas the quantity supplied 
refers to the amount suppliers wish to sell. In this example, supply does not change 
because the weather does not alter firms’ desire to sell at any given price. Instead, 
the hot weather alters consumers’ desire to buy at any given price and thereby 
shifts the demand curve to the right. The increase in demand causes the equilib-
rium price to rise. When the price rises, the quantity supplied rises. This increase in 
quantity supplied is represented by the movement along the supply curve.
To summarize, a shift in the supply curve is called a “change in supply,” and 
a shift in the demand curve is called a “change in demand.” A movement along a 
fixed supply curve is called a “change in the quantity supplied,” and a movement 
along a fixed demand curve is called a “change in the quantity demanded.”
Example: A Change in Market Equilibrium Due to a Shift in Supply 
Suppose that during another summer, a hurricane destroys part of the sugarcane 
crop and drives up the price of sugar. How does this event affect the market for 
ice cream? Once again, to answer this question, we follow our three steps. 
	 1.	 The change in the price of sugar, an input for making ice cream, affects the 
supply curve. By raising the costs of production, it reduces the amount of 
ice cream that firms produce and sell at any given price. The demand curve 
does not change because the higher cost of inputs does not directly affect the 
amount of ice cream households wish to buy.
	 2.	 The supply curve shifts to the left because, at every price, the total amount 
that firms are willing and able to sell is reduced. Figure 11 illustrates this 
decrease in supply as a shift in the supply curve from S1 to S2.

How an Increase in 
Demand Affects the 
Equilibrium
An event that raises quantity 
demanded at any given price 
shifts the demand curve to the 
right. The equilibrium price 
and the equilibrium quantity 
both rise. Here an abnormally 
hot summer causes buyers 
to demand more ice cream. 
The demand curve shifts 
from D1 to D2, which causes 
the equilibrium price to rise 
from $2.00 to $2.50 and the 
equilibrium quantity to rise 
from 7 to 10 cones.

CHAPTER 4    The Market Forces of Supply and Demand
	 3.	 At the old price of $2, there is now an excess demand for ice cream, and 
this shortage causes firms to raise the price. As Figure 11 shows, the shift in 
the supply curve raises the equilibrium price from $2.00 to $2.50 and low-
ers the equilibrium quantity from 7 to 4 cones. As a result of the sugar price 
increase, the price of ice cream rises, and the quantity of ice cream sold falls.
Example: Shifts in Both Supply and Demand  Now suppose that a heat 
wave and a hurricane occur during the same summer. To analyze this combina-
tion of events, we again follow our three steps. 
	 1.	 We determine that both curves must shift. The hot weather affects the 
demand curve because it alters the amount of ice cream that households 
want to buy at any given price. At the same time, when the hurricane drives 
up sugar prices, it alters the supply curve for ice cream because it changes 
the amount of ice cream that firms want to sell at any given price.
	 2.	 The curves shift in the same directions as they did in our previous analysis: 
The demand curve shifts to the right, and the supply curve shifts to the left. 
Figure 12 illustrates these shifts.
	 3.	 As Figure 12 shows, two possible outcomes might result depending on the 
relative size of the demand and supply shifts. In both cases, the equilibrium 
price rises. In panel (a), where demand increases substantially while supply 
falls just a little, the equilibrium quantity also rises. By contrast, in panel (b), 
where supply falls substantially while demand rises just a little, the equilib-
rium quantity falls. Thus, these events certainly raise the price of ice cream, 
but their impact on the amount of ice cream sold is ambiguous (that is, it 
could go either way).
How a Decrease in Supply 
Affects the Equilibrium
An event that reduces quantity 
supplied at any given price shifts 
the supply curve to the left. The 
equilibrium price rises, and the 
equilibrium quantity falls. Here an 
increase in the price of sugar (an 
input) causes sellers to supply less 
ice cream. The supply curve shifts 
from S1 to S2, which causes the 
equilibrium price of ice cream to 
rise from $2.00 to $2.50 and the 
equilibrium quantity to fall from 
7 to 4 cones.

How Markets Work
What’s Wrong with 
Price Gouging?
By Jeff Jacoby
T
here wasn’t much [Attorney General] 
Martha Coakley could do about the massive 
pipe break that left dozens of Greater Boston 
towns without clean drinking water over the 
weekend. So she kept herself busy instead 
lecturing vendors not to increase the price of 
the bottled water that tens of thousands of 
consumers were suddenly in a frenzy to buy.
	
“We have begun hearing anecdotal 
reports of the possible price gouging of 
store-bought water,’’ Coakley announced 
Sunday. “Businesses and individuals can-
not and should not take advantage of 
this ­public emergency to unfairly charge 
­consumers . . . for water.’’ Inspectors were 
being dispatched, “spot-checks’’ were being 
conducted, and “if we discover that businesses 
are engaging in price gouging,’’ she warned, 
“we will take appropriate legal action.’’
	
Governor Deval Patrick got into the 
act, too. He ordered the state’s Division of 
Standards to “closely monitor bottled water 
prices’’ in the area affected by the water 
emergency. “There is never an excuse for 
taking advantage of consumers,’’ he intoned, 
“especially not during times like this.’’
	
It never fails. No sooner does some 
calamity trigger an urgent need for basic 
resources than self-righteous voices are 
raised to denounce the amazingly efficient 
system that stimulates suppliers to speed 
those resources to the people who need 
them. That system is the free market’s 
price mechanism—the fluctuation of prices 
because of changes in supply and demand.
	
When the demand for bottled water goes 
through the roof—which is another way of 
saying that bottled water has become (rela-
tively) scarce—the price of water quickly rises 
in response. That price spike may be ­annoying, 
but it’s not nearly as annoying as being 
unable to find water for sale at any price. 
 Price Increases after Disasters
For several days in 2010, many towns around Boston found themselves 
without drinkable tap water. This increased the demand for bottled 
water, putting upward pressure on the price. While some policymakers 
cried foul, this opinion piece endorses the market’s natural response.

Here we observe a simultaneous increase in demand and decrease in supply. Two

CHAPTER 4    The Market Forces of Supply and Demand
Summary  We have just seen three examples of how to use supply and demand 
curves to analyze a change in equilibrium. Whenever an event shifts the supply 
curve, the demand curve, or perhaps both curves, you can use these tools to pre-
dict how the event will alter the price and quantity sold in equilibrium. Table 4 
shows the predicted outcome for any combination of shifts in the two curves. To

Rising prices help keep limited quantities 
from vanishing today, while increasing the 
odds of fresh supplies arriving tomorrow.
	
It is easy to demonize vendors who 
charge what the market will bear follow-
ing a catastrophe. “After storm come the 
vultures’’ USA Today memorably head-
lined a story about the price hikes that fol-
lowed Hurricane Charley in Florida in 2004.

least not yet, but her office has dedicated 
a telephone hotline and is encouraging the 
public to drop a dime on “price gougers.’’
	
Before you drop that dime, though, con-
sider who really serves the public interest—
the merchant who boosts his price during a 
crisis, or the merchant who refuses to?
	
A thought experiment: A massive pipe 
ruptures, tap water grows undrinkable, and 
consumers rush to buy bottled water from 
the only two vendors who sell it. Vendor 
A, not wanting to annoy the governor 
and attorney general, leaves the price of 
his water unchanged at 69 cents a bottle. 
Vendor B, who is more interested in doing 
business than truckling to politicians, more 
than quadruples his price to $2.99.
	
You don’t need an economics textbook 
to know what happens next.
	
Customers descend on Vendor A in 
droves, loading up on his 69-cent water. 
Within hours his entire stock has been 
cleaned out, and subsequent customers are 
turned away empty-handed. At Vendor B’s, 
on the other hand, sales of water are slower 
and there is a lot of grumbling about the 
high price. But even late-arriving customers 
are able to buy the water they need—and 
almost no one buys more than he truly 
needs.
	
When demand intensifies, prices rise. And 
as prices rise, suppliers work harder to meet 
demand. The same Globe story that reported 
yesterday on Coakley’s “price-gouging’’ state-
ment reported as well on the lengths to which 
bottlers and retailers were going to get more 
water into customers’ hands.
	
“Suppliers worked overtime, pumping 
up production at regional bottling facili-
ties and coordinating deliveries,’’ reporter 
Erin Ailworth noted. Polar Beverages in 
Worcester, for example, “had emptied out 
its plant in the city last night and trucked 
in loads of water from its New York 
facility.’’
	
Letting prices rise freely isn’t the only 
possible response to a sudden shortage. 
Government rationing is an option, and 
so are price controls—assuming you don’t 
object to the inevitable corruption, long 
lines, and black market. Better by far to let 
prices rise and fall freely. That isn’t “goug-
ing,’’ but plain good sense—and the best 
method yet devised for allocating goods and 
services among free men and women.

Conclusion: How Prices Allocate Resources
This chapter has analyzed supply and demand in a single market. Although our 
discussion has centered on the market for ice cream, the lessons learned here 
apply in most other markets as well. Whenever you go to a store to buy some-
thing, you are contributing to the demand for that item. Whenever you look for 
a job, you are contributing to the supply of labor services. Because supply and 
demand are such pervasive economic phenomena, the model of supply and 
demand is a powerful tool for analysis. We will be using this model repeatedly 
in the following chapters.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that markets are 
usually a good way to organize economic activity. Although it is still too early to 
judge whether market outcomes are good or bad, in this chapter we have begun 
to see how markets work. In any economic system, scarce resources have to be 
allocated among competing uses. Market economies harness the forces of supply 
and demand to serve that end. Supply and demand together determine the prices 
of the economy’s many different goods and services; prices in turn are the signals 
that guide the allocation of resources. 
For example, consider the allocation of beachfront land. Because the amount of 
this land is limited, not everyone can enjoy the luxury of living by the beach. Who 
gets this resource? The answer is whoever is willing and able to pay the price. The 
price of beachfront land adjusts until the quantity of land demanded exactly bal-
ances the quantity supplied. Thus, in market economies, prices are the mechanism 
for rationing scarce resources.
Similarly, prices determine who produces each good and how much is pro-
duced. For instance, consider farming. Because we need food to survive, it is 
crucial that some people work on farms. What determines who is a farmer and 
who is not? In a free society, there is no government planning agency making 
this decision and ensuring an adequate supply of food. Instead, the allocation 
of workers to farms is based on the job decisions of millions of workers. This 
decentralized system works well because these decisions depend on prices. The 
prices of food and the wages of farmworkers (the price of their labor) adjust to 
ensure that enough people choose to be farmers.
If a person had never seen a market economy in action, the whole idea might 
seem preposterous. Economies are enormous groups of people engaged in a 
multitude of interdependent activities. What prevents decentralized decision 
making from degenerating into chaos? What coordinates the actions of the mil-
lions of people with their varying abilities and desires? What ensures that what 
needs to be done is in fact done? The answer, in a word, is prices. If an invisible 
hand guides market economies, as Adam Smith famously suggested, then the 
price system is the baton that the invisible hand uses to conduct the economic 
orchestra.

CHAPTER 4    The Market Forces of Supply and Demand
• Economists use the model of supply and demand 
to analyze competitive markets. In a competitive 
market, there are many buyers and sellers, each 
of whom has little or no influence on the market 
price.
• The demand curve shows how the quantity of a 
good demanded depends on the price. According 
to the law of demand, as the price of a good falls, 
the quantity demanded rises. Therefore, the 
demand curve slopes downward.
• In addition to price, other determinants of how 
much consumers want to buy include income, 
the prices of substitutes and complements, 
tastes, expectations, and the number of buy-
ers. If one of these factors changes, the demand 
curve shifts.
• The supply curve shows how the quantity of a 
good supplied depends on the price. According 
to the law of supply, as the price of a good rises, 
the quantity supplied rises. Therefore, the supply 
curve slopes upward.
• In addition to price, other determinants of how 
much producers want to sell include input prices, 
technology, expectations, and the number of sell-
ers. If one of these factors changes, the supply 
curve shifts.
• The intersection of the supply and demand 
curves determines the market equilibrium. At 
the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded 
equals the quantity supplied. 
• The behavior of buyers and sellers naturally 
drives markets toward their equilibrium. When 
the market price is above the equilibrium price, 
there is a surplus of the good, which causes the 
market price to fall. When the market price is 
below the equilibrium price, there is a shortage, 
which causes the market price to rise. 
• To analyze how any event influences a mar-
ket, we use the supply-and-demand diagram to 
examine how the event affects the equilibrium 
price and quantity. To do this, we follow three 
steps. First, we decide whether the event shifts 
the supply curve or the demand curve (or both). 
Second, we decide in which direction the curve 
shifts. Third, we compare the new equilibrium 
with the initial equilibrium.
• In market economies, prices are the signals that 
guide economic decisions and thereby allocate 
scarce resources. For every good in the economy, 
the price ensures that supply and demand are in 
balance. The equilibrium price then determines 
how much of the good buyers choose to consume 
and how much sellers choose to produce.

is the equilibrium price and quantity in this 
market? 
b.	If the actual price in this market were above 
the equilibrium price, what would drive the 
market toward the equilibrium?

	11.	 Consider the following events: Scientists reveal 
that consumption of oranges decreases the risk 
of diabetes, and at the same time, farmers use 
a new fertilizer that makes orange trees more 
productive. Illustrate and explain what effect 
these changes have on the equilibrium price and 
quantity of oranges.
	12.	 Because bagels and cream cheese are often eaten 
together, they are complements.
a.	 We observe that both the equilibrium price of 
cream cheese and the equilibrium quantity of 
bagels have risen. What could be responsible 
for this pattern—a fall in the price of flour 
or a fall in the price of milk? Illustrate and 
explain your answer.
b.	Suppose instead that the equilibrium 
price of cream cheese has risen but the 
equilibrium quantity of bagels has fallen. 
What could be responsible for this pattern—
a rise in the price of flour or a rise in the 
price of milk? Illustrate and explain your 
answer.

	14.	 Market research has revealed the following 
information about the market for chocolate bars: 
The demand schedule can be represented by 
the equation QD = 1,600 – 300P, where QD is the 
quantity demanded and P is the price. The sup-
ply schedule can be represented by the equation 
QS = 1,400 + 700P, where QS is the quantity sup-
plied. Calculate the equilibrium price and quan-
tity in the market for chocolate bars.
