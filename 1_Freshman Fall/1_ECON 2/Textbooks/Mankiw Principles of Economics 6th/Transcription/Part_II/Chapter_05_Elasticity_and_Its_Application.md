magine that some event drives up the price of gasoline in the United States. 
It could be a war in the Middle East that disrupts the world supply of oil, a 
booming Chinese economy that boosts the world demand for oil, or a new 
tax on gasoline passed by Congress. How would U.S. consumers respond to 
the higher price?
It is easy to answer this question in broad fashion: Consumers would buy less. 
That is simply the law of demand we learned in the previous chapter But you 
might want a precise answer. By how much would consumption of gasoline fall? 
This question can be answered using a concept called elasticity, which we develop 
in this chapter.
Elasticity is a measure of how much buyers and sellers respond to changes in 
market conditions. When studying how some event or policy affects a market, 
we can discuss not only the direction of the effects but their magnitude as well. 
Elasticity is useful in many applications, as we see toward the end of this chapter.

Before proceeding, however, you might be curious about the answer to the 
gasoline question. Many studies have examined consumers’ response to gasoline 
prices, and they typically find that the quantity demanded responds more in the 
long run than it does in the short run. A 10 percent increase in gasoline prices 
reduces gasoline consumption by about 2.5 percent after a year and about 6 percent 
after five years. About half of the long-run reduction in quantity demanded arises 
because people drive less and half arises because they switch to more fuel-efficient 
cars. Both responses are reflected in the demand curve and its elasticity.
The Elasticity of Demand
When we introduced demand in Chapter 4, we noted that consumers usually buy 
more of a good when its price is lower, when their incomes are higher, when the 
prices of substitutes for the good are higher, or when the prices of complements of 
the good are lower. Our discussion of demand was qualitative, not quantitative. 
That is, we discussed the direction in which quantity demanded moves but not the 
size of the change. To measure how much consumers respond to changes in these 
variables, economists use the concept of elasticity. 
The Price Elasticity of Demand and Its Determinants
The law of demand states that a fall in the price of a good raises the quantity 
demanded. The price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity 
demanded responds to a change in price. Demand for a good is said to be elastic if the 
quantity demanded responds substantially to changes in the price. Demand is said to 
be inelastic if the quantity demanded responds only slightly to changes in the price.
The price elasticity of demand for any good measures how willing consumers 
are to buy less of the good as its price rises. Because the demand curve reflects 
the many economic, social, and psychological forces that shape consumer prefer-
ences, there is no simple, universal rule for what determines the demand curve’s 
elasticity. Based on experience, however, we can state some rules-of-thumb about 
what influences the price elasticity of demand.
Availability of Close Substitutes  Goods with close substitutes tend to have 
more elastic demand because it is easier for consumers to switch from that good to 
others. For example, butter and margarine are easily substitutable. A small increase 
in the price of butter, assuming the price of margarine is held fixed, causes the quan-
tity of butter sold to fall by a large amount. By contrast, because eggs are a food with-
out a close substitute, the demand for eggs is less elastic than the demand for butter.
Necessities versus Luxuries  Necessities tend to have inelastic demands, whereas 
luxuries have elastic demands. When the price of a doctor’s visit rises, people will not 
dramatically reduce the number of times they go to the doctor, although they might 
go somewhat less often. By contrast, when the price of sailboats rises, the quantity 
of sailboats demanded falls substantially. The reason is that most people view doc-
tor visits as a necessity and sailboats as a luxury. Whether a good is a necessity or a 
luxury depends not on the intrinsic properties of the good but on the preferences of 
the buyer. For avid sailors with little concern over their health, sailboats might be a 
necessity with inelastic demand and doctor visits a luxury with elastic demand. 
Definition of the Market  The elasticity of demand in any market depends on 
how we draw the boundaries of the market. Narrowly defined markets tend to have 
more elastic demand than broadly defined markets because it is easier to find close

CHAPTER 5    Elasticity and Its Application
substitutes for narrowly defined goods. For example, food, a broad category, has a 
fairly inelastic demand because there are no good substitutes for food. Ice cream, a 
narrower category, has a more elastic demand because it is easy to substitute other 
desserts for ice cream. Vanilla ice cream, a very narrow category, has a very elastic 
demand because other flavors of ice cream are almost perfect substitutes for vanilla. 
Time Horizon  Goods tend to have more elastic demand over longer time hori-
zons. When the price of gasoline rises, the quantity of gasoline demanded falls only 
slightly in the first few months. Over time, however, people buy more fuel-efficient 
cars, switch to public transportation, and move closer to where they work. Within 
several years, the quantity of gasoline demanded falls more substantially.
Computing the Price Elasticity of Demand
Now that we have discussed the price elasticity of demand in general terms, let’s 
be more precise about how it is measured. Economists compute the price elas­
ticity of demand as the percentage change in the quantity demanded divided by 
the percentage change in the price. That is, 
Price elasticity of demand 5 Percentage change in quantity demanded.
	
Percentage change in price
For example, suppose that a 10 percent increase in the price of an ice-cream cone 
causes the amount of ice cream you buy to fall by 20 percent. We calculate your 
elasticity of demand as 
Price elasticity of demand 5  20 percent 5 2.
	
   10 percent
In this example, the elasticity is 2, reflecting that the change in the quantity 
demanded is proportionately twice as large as the change in the price.
Because the quantity demanded of a good is negatively related to its price, the 
percentage change in quantity will always have the opposite sign as the percent-
age change in price. In this example, the percentage change in price is a positive 10 
percent (reflecting an increase), and the percentage change in quantity demanded 
is a negative 20 percent (reflecting a decrease). For this reason, price elasticities of 
demand are sometimes reported as negative numbers. In this book, we follow the 
common practice of dropping the minus sign and reporting all price elasticities of 
demand as positive numbers. (Mathematicians call this the absolute value.) With 
this convention, a larger price elasticity implies a greater responsiveness of quan-
tity demanded to changes in price.
The Midpoint Method: A Better Way to Calculate 
Percentage Changes and Elasticities
If you try calculating the price elasticity of demand between two points on a 
demand curve, you will quickly notice an annoying problem: The elasticity from 
point A to point B seems different from the elasticity from point B to point A. For 
example, consider these numbers:
	
Point A:	
Price 5 $4	
Quantity 5 120
	
Point B:	
Price 5 $6	
Quantity 5 80
Going from point A to point B, the price rises by 50 percent, and the quantity falls by 
33 percent, indicating that the price elasticity of demand is 33/50, or 0.66. By contrast, 
going from point B to point A, the price falls by 33 percent, and the quantity rises

by 50 percent, indicating that the price elasticity of demand is 50/33, or 1.5. This dif-
ference arises because the percentage changes are calculated from a different base.
One way to avoid this problem is to use the midpoint method for calculating 
elasticities. The standard procedure for computing a percentage change is to 
divide the change by the initial level. By contrast, the midpoint method computes 
a percentage change by dividing the change by the midpoint (or average) of the 
initial and final levels. For instance, $5 is the midpoint between $4 and $6. There-
fore, according to the midpoint method, a change from $4 to $6 is considered a 
40 percent rise because (6 2 4) / 5 3 100 5 40. Similarly, a change from $6 to $4 
is considered a 40 percent fall.
Because the midpoint method gives the same answer regardless of the direc-
tion of change, it is often used when calculating the price elasticity of demand 
between two points. In our example, the midpoint between point A and point B is:
Midpoint:    Price = $5    Quantity = 100
According to the midpoint method, when going from point A to point B, the price 
rises by 40 percent, and the quantity falls by 40 percent. Similarly, when going 
from point B to point A, the price falls by 40 percent, and the quantity rises by 40 
percent. In both directions, the price elasticity of demand equals 1. 
The following formula expresses the midpoint method for calculating the price 
elasticity of demand between two points, denoted (Q1, P1) and (Q2, P2):
Price elasticity of demand 5 (Q2 2 Q1) / [(Q2 1 Q1) / 2]
.
	
  (P2 2 P1) / [(P2 1 P1) / 2]	
The numerator is the percentage change in quantity computed using the midpoint 
method, and the denominator is the percentage change in price computed using 
the midpoint method. If you ever need to calculate elasticities, you should use 
this formula.
In this book, however, we rarely perform such calculations. For most of our 
purposes, what elasticity represents—the responsiveness of quantity demanded 
to a change in price—is more important than how it is calculated.
The Variety of Demand Curves 
Economists classify demand curves according to their elasticity. Demand is con-
sidered elastic when the elasticity is greater than 1, which means the quantity 
moves proportionately more than the price. Demand is considered inelastic when 
the elasticity is less than 1, which means the quantity moves proportionately less 
than the price. If the elasticity is exactly 1, the quantity moves the same amount 
proportionately as the price, and demand is said to have unit elasticity. 
Because the price elasticity of demand measures how much quantity demanded 
responds to changes in the price, it is closely related to the slope of the demand 
curve. The following rule of thumb is a useful guide: The flatter the demand curve 
that passes through a given point, the greater the price elasticity of demand. The 
steeper the demand curve that passes through a given point, the smaller the price 
elasticity of demand.
Figure 1 shows five cases. In the extreme case of a zero elasticity, shown in 
panel (a), demand is perfectly inelastic, and the demand curve is vertical. In this 
case, regardless of the price, the quantity demanded stays the same. As the elasticity 
rises, the demand curve gets flatter and flatter, as shown in panels (b), (c), and (d). 
At the opposite extreme, shown in panel (e), demand is perfectly elastic. This

HOW MARKETS WORK
FYI
W
e have talked about what elasticity means, what determines 
it, and how it is calculated. Beyond these general ideas, you 
might ask for a specific number. How much, precisely, does the price 
of a particular good influence the quantity demanded?
	
To answer such a question, economists collect data from market 
outcomes and apply statistical techniques to estimate the price 
elasticity of demand. Here are some price elasticities of demand, 
obtained from various studies, for a range of goods:
Eggs	
0.1
Healthcare	
0.2
Rice	
0.5
Housing 	
0.7
Beef	
1.6
Restaurant Meals	
2.3
Mountain Dew	
4.4
These kinds of numbers are fun to think about, and they can be 
useful when comparing markets.
	
Nonetheless, one should take these estimates with a grain of 
salt. One reason is that the statistical techniques used to obtain 
them require some assumptions about the world, and these 
assumptions might not be true in practice. (The details of these 
techniques are beyond the scope of this book, but you will encoun-
ter them if you take a course in econometrics.) Another reason is 
that the price elasticity of demand need not be the same at all 
points on a demand curve, as we will see shortly in the case of a 
linear demand curve. For both reasons, you should not be surprised 
if different studies report different price elasticities of demand for 
the same good.
occurs as the price elasticity of demand approaches infinity and the demand curve 
becomes horizontal, reflecting the fact that very small changes in the price lead to 
huge changes in the quantity demanded.
Finally, if you have trouble keeping straight the terms elastic and inelastic, here’s 
a memory trick for you: Inelastic curves, such as in panel (a) of Figure 1, look like 
the letter I. This is not a deep insight, but it might help on your next exam.
Total Revenue and the Price Elasticity of Demand
When studying changes in supply or demand in a market, one variable we often 
want to study is total revenue, the amount paid by buyers and received by sellers 
of the good. In any market, total revenue is P 3 Q, the price of the good times the 
quantity of the good sold. We can show total revenue graphically, as in Figure 2. 
The height of the box under the demand curve is P, and the width is Q. The area 
of this box, P 3 Q, equals the total revenue in this market. In Figure 2, where 
P = $4 and Q = 100, total revenue is $4 3 100, or $400.
How does total revenue change as one moves along the demand curve? The 
answer depends on the price elasticity of demand. If demand is inelastic, as in panel 
(a) of Figure 3, then an increase in the price causes an increase in total revenue. Here 
an increase in price from $4 to $5 causes the quantity demanded to fall from 100 to 
90, so total revenue rises from $400 to $450. An increase in price raises P 3 Q because 
the fall in Q is proportionately smaller than the rise in P. In other words, the extra 
revenue from selling units at a higher price (represented by area A in the figure) more 
than offsets the decline in revenue from selling fewer units (represented by area B).

The impact of a price change on total revenue (the product of price and quantity) 
depends on the elasticity of demand. In panel (a), the demand curve is inelastic. In 
this case, an increase in the price leads to a decrease in quantity demanded that is 
proportionately smaller, so total revenue increases. Here an increase in the price from 
$4 to $5 causes the quantity demanded to fall from 100 to 90. Total revenue rises from 
$400 to $450. In panel (b), the demand curve is elastic. In this case, an increase in the 
price leads to a decrease in quantity demanded that is proportionately larger, so total 
revenue decreases. Here an increase in the price from $4 to $5 causes the quantity 
demanded to fall from 100 to 70. Total revenue falls from $400 to $350.

We obtain the opposite result if demand is elastic: An increase in the price 
causes a decrease in total revenue. In panel (b) of Figure 3, for instance, when the 
price rises from $4 to $5, the quantity demanded falls from 100 to 70, so total rev-
enue falls from $400 to $350. Because demand is elastic, the reduction in the quan-
tity demanded is so great that it more than offsets the increase in the price. That is, 
an increase in price reduces P 3 Q because the fall in Q is proportionately greater 
than the rise in P. In this case, the extra revenue from selling units at a higher price 
(area A) is smaller than the decline in revenue from selling fewer units (area B).
The examples in this figure illustrate some general rules:
• 	 When demand is inelastic (a price elasticity less than 1), price and total  
revenue move in the same direction.
• 	 When demand is elastic (a price elasticity greater than 1), price and total  
revenue move in opposite directions.
• 	 If demand is unit elastic (a price elasticity exactly equal to 1), total revenue 
remains constant when the price changes.
Elasticity and Total Revenue along a Linear  
Demand Curve
Let’s examine how elasticity varies along a linear demand curve, as shown in 
­Figure 4. We know that a straight line has a constant slope. Slope is defined as 
Elasticity of a Linear Demand Curve
The slope of a linear demand curve is constant, but its elasticity 
is not. The demand schedule in the table was used to calculate 
the price elasticity of demand by the midpoint method. At points 
with a low price and high quantity, the demand curve is inelastic. 
At points with a high price and low quantity, the demand curve 
is elastic.

CHAPTER 5    Elasticity and Its Application
“rise over run,” which here is the ratio of the change in price (“rise”) to the change 
in quantity (“run”). This particular demand curve’s slope is constant because each 
$1 increase in price causes the same two-unit decrease in the quantity demanded. 
Even though the slope of a linear demand curve is constant, the elasticity is not. 
This is true because the slope is the ratio of changes in the two variables, whereas 
the elasticity is the ratio of percentage changes in the two variables. You can see 
this by looking at the table in Figure 4, which shows the demand schedule for the 
linear demand curve in the graph. The table uses the midpoint method to calcu-
late the price elasticity of demand. At points with a low price and high quantity, 
the demand curve is inelastic. At points with a high price and low quantity, the 
demand curve is elastic.
The table also presents total revenue at each point on the demand curve. These 
numbers illustrate the relationship between total revenue and elasticity. When the 
price is $1, for instance, demand is inelastic, and a price increase to $2 raises total 
revenue. When the price is $5, demand is elastic, and a price increase to $6 reduces 
total revenue. Between $3 and $4, demand is exactly unit elastic, and total revenue 
is the same at these two prices.
The linear demand curve illustrates that the price elasticity of demand need not 
be the same at all points on a demand curve. A constant elasticity is possible, but 
it is not always the case.
Other Demand Elasticities 
In addition to the price elasticity of demand, economists use other elasticities to 
describe the behavior of buyers in a market. 
The Income Elasticity of Demand   The income elasticity of demand mea-
sures how the quantity demanded changes as consumer income changes. It is 
calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the per-
centage change in income. That is,
Income elasticity of demand = Percentage change in quantity demanded .
	
Percentage change in income
As we discussed in Chapter 4, most goods are normal goods: Higher income raises 
the quantity demanded. Because quantity demanded and income move in the 
same direction, normal goods have positive income elasticities. A few goods, such 
as bus rides, are inferior goods: Higher income lowers the quantity demanded. 
Because quantity demanded and income move in opposite directions, inferior 
goods have negative income elasticities.
Even among normal goods, income elasticities vary substantially in size. 
Necessities, such as food and clothing, tend to have small income elasticities 
because consumers choose to buy some of these goods even when their incomes 
are low. Luxuries, such as caviar and diamonds, tend to have large income elas-
ticities because consumers feel that they can do without these goods altogether if 
their incomes are too low. 
The Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand   The cross-price elasticity of demand 
measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price 
of another good. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded of 
good 1 divided by the percentage change in the price of good 2. That is,
Cross-price elasticity of demand = Percentage change in quantity demanded of good 1.

HOW MARKETS WORK
Whether the cross-price elasticity is a positive or negative number depends on 
whether the two goods are substitutes or complements. As we discussed in ­Chapter 
4, substitutes are goods that are typically used in place of one another, such as 
hamburgers and hot dogs. An increase in hot dog prices induces people to grill 
hamburgers instead. Because the price of hot dogs and the quantity of hamburgers 
demanded move in the same direction, the cross-price elasticity is positive. Con-
versely, complements are goods that are typically used together, such as computers 
and software. In this case, the cross-price elasticity is negative, indicating that an 
increase in the price of computers reduces the quantity of software demanded.
Quick Quiz  Define the price elasticity of demand. • Explain the relationship 
between total revenue and the price elasticity of demand.
The Elasticity of Supply
When we introduced supply in Chapter 4, we noted that producers of a good offer to 
sell more of it when the price of the good rises. To turn from qualitative to quantita-
tive statements about quantity supplied, we once again use the concept of elasticity.
The Price Elasticity of Supply and Its Determinants
The law of supply states that higher prices raise the quantity supplied. The price 
elasticity of supply measures how much the quantity supplied responds to 
changes in the price. Supply of a good is said to be elastic if the quantity supplied 
responds substantially to changes in the price. Supply is said to be inelastic if the 
quantity supplied responds only slightly to changes in the price.
The price elasticity of supply depends on the flexibility of sellers to change the 
amount of the good they produce. For example, beachfront land has an inelastic 
supply because it is almost impossible to produce more of it. By contrast, manu-
factured goods, such as books, cars, and televisions, have elastic supplies because 
firms that produce them can run their factories longer in response to a higher price.
In most markets, a key determinant of the price elasticity of supply is the time 
period being considered. Supply is usually more elastic in the long run than in 
the short run. Over short periods of time, firms cannot easily change the size of 
their factories to make more or less of a good. Thus, in the short run, the quantity 
supplied is not very responsive to the price. By contrast, over longer periods, 
firms can build new factories or close old ones. In addition, new firms can enter a 
market, and old firms can shut down. Thus, in the long run, the quantity supplied 
can respond substantially to price changes.
Computing the Price Elasticity of Supply
Now that we have a general understanding about the price elasticity of supply, 
let’s be more precise. Economists compute the price elasticity of supply as the 
percentage change in the quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in 
the price. That is, 
Price elasticity of supply = Percentage change in quantity supplied .
	
Percentage change in price
For example, suppose that an increase in the price of milk from $2.85 to $3.15 a 
gallon raises the amount that dairy farmers produce from 9,000 to 11,000 gallons

per month. Using the midpoint method, we calculate the percentage change in 
price as
Percentage change in price = (3.15 – 2.85) / 3.00 × 100 = 10 percent.
Similarly, we calculate the percentage change in quantity supplied as
Percentage change in quantity supplied = (11,000 – 9,000) / 10,000 × 100 = 20 percent.
In this case, the price elasticity of supply is 
Price elasticity of supply =  20 percent = 2.0.
	
    10 percent
In this example, the elasticity of 2 indicates that the quantity supplied changes 
proportionately twice as much as the price.
The Variety of Supply Curves
Because the price elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of quantity sup-
plied to the price, it is reflected in the appearance of the supply curve. Figure 5 shows 
five cases. In the extreme case of a zero elasticity, as shown in panel (a), supply is 
perfectly inelastic, and the supply curve is vertical. In this case, the quantity supplied 
is the same regardless of the price. As the elasticity rises, the supply curve gets flat-
ter, which shows that the quantity supplied responds more to changes in the price. 
At the opposite extreme, shown in panel (e), supply is perfectly elastic. This occurs 
as the price elasticity of supply approaches infinity and the supply curve becomes 
horizontal, meaning that very small changes in the price lead to very large changes 
in the quantity supplied.
In some markets, the elasticity of supply is not constant but varies over the 
supply curve. Figure 6 shows a typical case for an industry in which firms have 
factories with a limited capacity for production. For low levels of quantity sup-
plied, the elasticity of supply is high, indicating that firms respond substantially 
to changes in the price. In this region, firms have capacity for production that is 
not being used, such as plants and equipment idle for all or part of the day. Small 
increases in price make it profitable for firms to begin using this idle capacity. As 
the quantity supplied rises, firms begin to reach capacity. Once capacity is fully 
used, increasing production further requires the construction of new plants. To 
induce firms to incur this extra expense, the price must rise substantially, so sup-
ply becomes less elastic.
Figure 6 presents a numerical example of this phenomenon. When the price 
rises from $3 to $4 (a 29 percent increase, according to the midpoint method), the 
quantity supplied rises from 100 to 200 (a 67 percent increase). Because quantity 
supplied changes proportionately more than the price, the supply curve has elas-
ticity greater than 1. By contrast, when the price rises from $12 to $15 (a 22 percent 
increase), the quantity supplied rises from 500 to 525 (a 5 percent increase). In this 
case, quantity supplied moves proportionately less than the price, so the elasticity 
is less than 1.

CHAPTER 5    Elasticity and Its Application
How the Price Elasticity of Supply Can Vary
Because firms often have a maximum capacity for 
production, the elasticity of supply may be very high 
at low levels of quantity supplied and very low at high 
levels of quantity supplied. Here an increase in price 
from $3 to $4 increases the quantity supplied from 100 
to 200. Because the 67 percent increase in quantity 
supplied (computed using the midpoint method) is 
larger than the 29 percent increase in price, the supply 
curve is elastic in this range. By contrast, when the 
price rises from $12 to $15, the quantity supplied rises 
only from 500 to 525. Because the 5 percent increase in 
quantity supplied is smaller than the 22 percent increase 
in price, the supply curve is inelastic in this range.

Three Applications of Supply, Demand, and Elasticity
Can good news for farming be bad news for farmers? Why did OPEC fail to keep 
the price of oil high? Does drug interdiction increase or decrease drug-related 
crime? At first, these questions might seem to have little in common. Yet all three 
questions are about markets, and all markets are subject to the forces of supply 
and demand. Here we apply the versatile tools of supply, demand, and elasticity 
to answer these seemingly complex questions.
Can Good News for Farming Be Bad News  
for Farmers?
Imagine yourself as a Kansas wheat farmer. Because you earn all your income 
from selling wheat, you devote much effort to making your land as productive 
as possible. You monitor weather and soil conditions, check your fields for pests 
and disease, and study the latest advances in farm technology. You know that the 
more wheat you grow, the more you will have to sell after the harvest, and the 
higher will be your income and your standard of living. 
One day, Kansas State University announces a major discovery. Researchers 
in its agronomy department have devised a new hybrid of wheat that raises the 
amount farmers can produce from each acre of land by 20 percent. How should 
you react to this news? Does this discovery make you better off or worse off than 
you were before?
Recall from Chapter 4 that we answer such questions in three steps. First, we 
examine whether the supply or demand curve shifts. Second, we consider in 
which direction the curve shifts. Third, we use the supply-and-demand diagram 
to see how the market equilibrium changes.

PART II	
HOW MARKETS WORK
In this case, the discovery of the new hybrid affects the supply curve. Because 
the hybrid increases the amount of wheat that can be produced on each acre 
of land, farmers are now willing to supply more wheat at any given price. In 
other words, the supply curve shifts to the right. The demand curve remains the 
same because consumers’ desire to buy wheat products at any given price is not 
affected by the introduction of a new hybrid. Figure 7 shows an example of such 
a change. When the supply curve shifts from S1 to S2, the quantity of wheat sold 
increases from 100 to 110, and the price of wheat falls from $3 to $2.
Does this discovery make farmers better off? As a first cut to answering 
this question, consider what happens to the total revenue received by farmers. 
Farmers’ total revenue is P 3 Q, the price of the wheat times the quantity sold. The 
discovery affects farmers in two conflicting ways. The hybrid allows farmers to 
produce more wheat (Q rises), but now each bushel of wheat sells for less (P falls). 
Whether total revenue rises or falls depends on the elasticity of demand. 
In practice, the demand for basic foodstuffs such as wheat is usually inelastic 
because these items are relatively inexpensive and have few good substitutes. 
When the demand curve is inelastic, as it is in Figure 7, a decrease in price causes 
total revenue to fall. You can see this in the figure: The price of wheat falls sub-
stantially, whereas the quantity of wheat sold rises only slightly. Total revenue 
falls from $300 to $220. Thus, the discovery of the new hybrid lowers the total 
revenue that farmers receive from the sale of their crops. 
If farmers are made worse off by the discovery of this new hybrid, one might 
wonder why they adopt it. The answer goes to the heart of how competitive mar-
kets work. Because each farmer is only a small part of the market for wheat, he or 
she takes the price of wheat as given. For any given price of wheat, it is better to 
use the new hybrid to produce and sell more wheat. Yet when all farmers do this, 
the supply of wheat increases, the price falls, and farmers are worse off. 
Although this example may at first seem hypothetical, it helps to explain a 
major change in the U.S. economy over the past century. Two hundred years ago, 
most Americans lived on farms. Knowledge about farm methods was sufficiently 
An Increase in Supply in the Market for Wheat
When an advance in farm technology increases the 
supply of wheat from S1 to S2, the price of wheat 
falls. Because the demand for wheat is inelastic, 
the increase in the quantity sold from 100 to 110 is 
proportionately smaller than the decrease in  
the price from $3 to $2. As a result, farmers’  
total revenue falls from $300 ($3 3 100) to 
$220 ($2 3 110).

CHAPTER 5    Elasticity and Its Application
primitive that most Americans had to be farmers to produce enough food to feed 
the nation’s population. Yet over time, advances in farm technology increased 
the amount of food that each farmer could produce. This increase in food supply, 
together with inelastic food demand, caused farm revenues to fall, which in turn 
encouraged people to leave farming.
A few numbers show the magnitude of this historic change. As recently as 1950, 
10 million people worked on farms in the United States, representing 17 percent 
of the labor force. Today, fewer than 3 million people work on farms, or 2 percent 
of the labor force. This change coincided with tremendous advances in farm pro-
ductivity: Despite the 70 percent drop in the number of farmers, U.S. farms now 
produce more than twice the output of crops and livestock that they did in 1950.
This analysis of the market for farm products also helps to explain a seeming 
paradox of public policy: Certain farm programs try to help farmers by induc-
ing them not to plant crops on all of their land. The purpose of these programs 
is to reduce the supply of farm products and thereby raise prices. With inelastic 
demand for their products, farmers as a group receive greater total revenue if 
they supply a smaller crop to the market. No single farmer would choose to leave 
his land fallow on his own because each takes the market price as given. But if all 
farmers do so together, each of them can be better off.
When analyzing the effects of farm technology or farm policy, it is important to 
keep in mind that what is good for farmers is not necessarily good for society as a 
whole. Improvement in farm technology can be bad for farmers because it makes 
farmers increasingly unnecessary, but it is surely good for consumers who pay 
less for food. Similarly, a policy aimed at reducing the supply of farm products 
may raise the incomes of farmers, but it does so at the expense of consumers.
Why Did OPEC Fail to Keep the Price of Oil High?
Many of the most disruptive events for the world’s economies over the past sev-
eral decades have originated in the world market for oil. In the 1970s, members 
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided to raise 
the world price of oil to increase their incomes. These countries accomplished this 
goal by jointly reducing the amount of oil they supplied. From 1973 to 1974, the 
price of oil (adjusted for overall inflation) rose more than 50 percent. Then, a few 
years later, OPEC did the same thing again. From 1979 to 1981, the price of oil 
approximately doubled.

HOW MARKETS WORK
Yet OPEC found it difficult to maintain a high price. From 1982 to 1985, the 
price of oil steadily declined about 10 percent per year. Dissatisfaction and disar-
ray soon prevailed among the OPEC countries. In 1986, cooperation among OPEC 
members completely broke down, and the price of oil plunged 45 percent. In 1990, 
the price of oil (adjusted for overall inflation) was back to where it began in 1970, 
and it stayed at that low level throughout most of the 1990s. (In the first decade of 
the 21st century, the price of oil fluctuated substantially once again, but the main 
driving force was changes in world demand rather than OPEC supply restrictions. 
Early in the decade, oil demand and prices spiked up, in part because of a large 
and rapidly growing Chinese economy. Prices plunged in 2008–2009 as the world 
economy fell into a deep recession and then started rising once again as the world 
economy started to recover.)  
The OPEC episodes of the 1970s and 1980s show how supply and demand 
can behave differently in the short run and in the long run. In the short run, both 
the supply and demand for oil are relatively inelastic. Supply is inelastic because 
the quantity of known oil reserves and the capacity for oil extraction cannot be 
changed quickly. Demand is inelastic because buying habits do not respond 
immediately to changes in price. Thus, as panel (a) of Figure 8 shows, the short-
run supply and demand curves are steep. When the supply of oil shifts from S1 to 
S2, the price increase from P1 to P2 is large.
The situation is very different in the long run. Over long periods of time, 
producers of oil outside OPEC respond to high prices by increasing oil explora-
tion and by building new extraction capacity. Consumers respond with greater 
conservation, such as by replacing old inefficient cars with newer efficient ones. 
Thus, as panel (b) of Figure 8 shows, the long-run supply and demand curves are 
When the supply of oil falls, the response depends on the time horizon. In the short 
run, supply and demand are relatively inelastic, as in panel (a). Thus, when the supply 
curve shifts from S1 to S2, the price rises substantially. By contrast, in the long run, 
supply and demand are relatively elastic, as in panel (b). In this case, the same size 
shift in the supply curve (S1 to S2) causes a smaller increase in the price.

CHAPTER 5    Elasticity and Its Application
more elastic. In the long run, the shift in the supply curve from S1 to S2 causes a 
much smaller increase in the price.
This analysis shows why OPEC succeeded in maintaining a high price of oil 
only in the short run. When OPEC countries agreed to reduce their production 
of oil, they shifted the supply curve to the left. Even though each OPEC member 
sold less oil, the price rose by so much in the short run that OPEC incomes rose. 
By contrast, in the long run, when supply and demand are more elastic, the same 
reduction in supply, measured by the horizontal shift in the supply curve, caused 
a smaller increase in the price. Thus, OPEC’s coordinated reduction in supply 
proved less profitable in the long run. The cartel learned that raising prices is 
easier in the short run than in the long run.
Does Drug Interdiction Increase or Decrease 
­Drug-Related Crime?
A persistent problem facing our society is the use of illegal drugs, such as heroin, 
cocaine, ecstasy, and crack. Drug use has several adverse effects. One is that drug 
dependence can ruin the lives of drug users and their families. Another is that drug 
addicts often turn to robbery and other violent crimes to obtain the money needed 
to support their habit. To discourage the use of illegal drugs, the U.S. government 
devotes billions of dollars each year to reduce the flow of drugs into the country. 
Let’s use the tools of supply and demand to examine this policy of drug interdiction.
Suppose the government increases the number of federal agents devoted to 
the war on drugs. What happens in the market for illegal drugs? As is usual, 
we answer this question in three steps. First, we consider whether the supply or 
demand curve shifts. Second, we consider the direction of the shift. Third, we see 
how the shift affects the equilibrium price and quantity.
Although the purpose of drug interdiction is to reduce drug use, its direct impact 
is on the sellers of drugs rather than the buyers. When the government stops some 
drugs from entering the country and arrests more smugglers, it raises the cost of 
selling drugs and, therefore, reduces the quantity of drugs supplied at any given 
price. The demand for drugs—the amount buyers want at any given price—is not 
changed. As panel (a) of Figure 9 shows, interdiction shifts the supply curve to the 
left from S1 to S2 and leaves the demand curve the same. The equilibrium price of 
drugs rises from P1 to P2, and the equilibrium quantity falls from Q1 to Q2. The fall 
in the equilibrium quantity shows that drug interdiction does reduce drug use.
But what about the amount of drug-related crime? To answer this question, 
consider the total amount that drug users pay for the drugs they buy. Because 
few drug addicts are likely to break their destructive habits in response to a 
higher price, it is likely that the demand for drugs is inelastic, as it is drawn in the 
figure. If demand is inelastic, then an increase in price raises total revenue in the 
drug market. That is, because drug interdiction raises the price of drugs propor-
tionately more than it reduces drug use, it raises the total amount of money that 
drug users pay for drugs. Addicts who already had to steal to support their habits 
would have an even greater need for quick cash. Thus, drug interdiction could 
increase drug-related crime. 
Because of this adverse effect of drug interdiction, some analysts argue for alter-
native approaches to the drug problem. Rather than trying to reduce the ­supply 
of drugs, policymakers might try to reduce the demand by pursuing a policy of 
drug education. Successful drug education has the effects shown in panel (b) of 
Figure 9. The demand curve shifts to the left from D1 to D2. As a result, the equi-
librium quantity falls from Q1 to Q2, and the equilibrium price falls from P1 to P2.

Drug interdiction reduces the supply of drugs from S1 to S2, as in panel (a). If the 
demand for drugs is inelastic, then the total amount paid by drug users rises, even 
as the amount of drug use falls. By contrast, drug education reduces the demand for 
drugs from D1 to D2, as in panel (b). Because both price and quantity fall, the amount 
paid by drug users falls.

Total revenue, which is price times quantity, also falls. Thus, in contrast to drug 
interdiction, drug education can reduce both drug use and drug-related crime.
Advocates of drug interdiction might argue that the long-run effects of this 
policy are different from the short-run effects because the elasticity of demand 
depends on the time horizon. The demand for drugs is probably inelastic over 
short periods because higher prices do not substantially affect drug use by estab-
lished addicts. But demand may be more elastic over longer periods because 
higher prices would discourage experimentation with drugs among the young 
and, over time, lead to fewer drug addicts. In this case, drug interdiction would 
increase drug-related crime in the short run while decreasing it in the long run.

Conclusion
According to an old quip, even a parrot can become an economist simply by learn-
ing to say “supply and demand.” These last two chapters should have convinced 
you that there is much truth in this statement. The tools of supply and demand 
allow you to analyze many of the most important events and policies that shape 
the economy. You are now well on your way to becoming an economist (or at least

CHAPTER 5    Elasticity and Its Application
Summary
• The price elasticity of demand measures how 
much the quantity demanded responds to 
­changes in the price. Demand tends to be more 
elastic if close substitutes are available, if the 
good is a luxury rather than a necessity, if the 
market is narrowly defined, or if buyers have 
substantial time to react to a price change.
• The price elasticity of demand is calculated as 
the percentage change in quantity demanded 
divided by the percentage change in price. If 
quantity demanded moves proportionately less 
than the price, then the elasticity is less than 1, 
and demand is said to be inelastic. If quantity 
demanded moves proportionately more than 
the price, then the elasticity is greater than 1, 
and demand is said to be elastic.
• Total revenue, the total amount paid for a good, 
equals the price of the good times the quantity 
sold. For inelastic demand curves, total revenue 
moves in the same direction as the price. For 
elastic demand curves, total revenue moves in 
the opposite direction as the price.
• The income elasticity of demand measures 
how much the quantity demanded responds to 
changes in consumers’ income. The cross-price 
elasticity of demand measures how much the 
quantity demanded of one good responds to 
changes in the price of another good. 
• The price elasticity of supply measures how 
much the quantity supplied responds to changes 
in the price. This elasticity often depends on the 
time horizon under consideration. In most mar-
kets, supply is more elastic in the long run than 
in the short run.
• The price elasticity of supply is calculated as the 
percentage change in quantity supplied divided 
by the percentage change in price. If quantity 
supplied moves proportionately less than the 
price, then the elasticity is less than 1, and sup-
ply is said to be inelastic. If quantity supplied 
moves proportionately more than the price, then 
the elasticity is greater than 1, and supply is said 
to be elastic.
• The tools of supply and demand can be applied 
in many different kinds of markets. This chap-
ter uses them to analyze the market for wheat, 
the market for oil, and the market for illegal 
drugs.

	10.	 Is the price elasticity of supply usually larger in 
the short run or in the long run? Why?
	11.	 How can elasticity help explain why drug 
interdiction could reduce the supply of drugs, 
yet possibly increase drug-related crime?

	 2.	 Suppose that business travelers and vacationers 
have the following demand for airline tickets 
from New York to Boston:
	
	
Quantity Demanded	
Quantity Demanded 
	
Price	
(business travelers)	
(vacationers)
	
$150	
2,100 tickets	
1,000 tickets
	
  200	
2,000	
   800
	
  250	
1,900	
   600
	
  300	
1,800	
   400
a.	 As the price of tickets rises from $200 to 
$250, what is the price elasticity of demand 
for (i) business travelers and (ii) vacation-
ers? (Use the midpoint method in your 
calculations.)
b.	Why might vacationers have a different  
elasticity from business travelers?
	 3.	 Suppose the price elasticity of demand for  
heating oil is 0.2 in the short run and 0.7 in the 
long run. 
a.	 if the price of heating oil rises from $1.80  
to $2.20 per gallon, what happens to the 
quantity of heating oil demanded in the short 
run? In the long run? (Use the midpoint 
method in your calculations.)
b.	Why might this elasticity depend on the time 
horizon?
	 4.	 A price change causes the quantity demanded 
of a good to decrease by 30 percent, while  
the total revenue of that good increases by  
15 percent. Is the demand curve elastic or 
inelastic? Explain. 
	 5.	 The equilibrium price of coffee mugs rose sharply 
last month, but the equilibrium quantity was 
the same as ever. Three people tried to explain 
the situation. Which explanations could be 
right? Explain your logic.
Billy:	 Demand increased, but supply was 
totally inelastic.
Marian:	 Supply increased, but so did 
demand.
Valerie:	 Supply decreased, but demand was 
totally inelastic.
	 6.	 Suppose that your demand schedule for DVDs 
is as follows:
	
	
Quantity Demanded	
Quantity Demanded 
	
Price	
(income = $10,000)	
(income = $12,000)
	
$  8	
40 DVDs	
50 DVDs
	
  10	
32	
45
	
  12	
24	
30
	
  14	
16	
20
	
  16	
  8	
12
a.	 Use the midpoint method to calculate your 
price elasticity of demand as the price of 
DVDs increases from $8 to $10 if (i) your 
income is $10,000 and (ii) your income is 
$12,000.
b.	Calculate your income elasticity of demand 
as your income increases from $10,000 to 
$12,000 if (i) the price is $12 and (ii) the price 
is $16.
	 7.	 You have the following information about good 
X and good Y:
•	 Income elasticity of demand for good X: –3
•	 Cross-price elasticity of demand for good X 
with respect to the price of good Y: 2
Would an increase in income and a decrease in 
the price of good Y unambiguously decrease 
the demand for good X? Why or why not?
	 8.	 Maria has decided always to spend one-third of 
her income on clothing.

CHAPTER 5    Elasticity and Its Application
a.	 What is her income elasticity of clothing 
demand? 
b.	What is her price elasticity of clothing 
demand?
c.	 If Maria’s tastes change and she decides 
to spend only one-fourth of her income 
on clothing, how does her demand curve 
change? What is her income elasticity and 
price elasticity now?
	 9.	 The New York Times reported (Feb. 17, 1996) that 
subway ridership declined after a fare increase: 
“There were nearly four million fewer riders 
in December 1995, the first full month after the 
price of a token increased 25 cents to $1.50, than 
in the previous December, a 4.3 percent decline.” 
a.	 Use these data to estimate the price elasticity 
of demand for subway rides. 
b.	According to your estimate, what happens 
to the Transit Authority’s revenue when the 
fare rises? 
c.	 Why might your estimate of the elasticity be 
unreliable?
	10.	 Two drivers—Tom and Jerry—each drive up to 
a gas station. Before looking at the price, each 
places an order. Tom says, “I’d like 10 gallons 
of gas.” Jerry says, “I’d like $10 worth of gas.” 
What is each driver’s price elasticity of demand?
	11.	 Consider public policy aimed at smoking. 
a.	 Studies indicate that the price elasticity of 
demand for cigarettes is about 0.4. If a pack  
of cigarettes currently costs $2 and the 
­government wants to reduce smoking by  
20 percent, by how much should it increase 
the price?
b.	If the government permanently increases 
the price of cigarettes, will the policy have a 
larger effect on smoking one year from now 
or five years from now?
c.	 Studies also find that teenagers have a 
­higher price elasticity than do adults. Why 
might this be true?
	12.	 You are the curator of a museum. The 
museum is running short of funds, so you 
decide to increase revenue. Should you  
increase or decrease the price of admission? 
Explain.
	13.	 Pharmaceutical drugs have an inelastic 
demand, and computers have an elastic 
demand. Suppose that technological advance 
doubles the supply of both products (that is, 
the quantity supplied at each price is twice 
what it was). 
a.	 What happens to the equilibrium price and 
quantity in each market?
b.	Which product experiences a larger change 
in price?
c.	 Which product experiences a larger change 
in quantity?
d.	What happens to total consumer spending 
on each product?
	14.	 Several years ago, flooding along the Missouri 
and the Mississippi rivers destroyed thousands 
of acres of wheat.
a.	 Farmers whose crops were destroyed by the 
floods were much worse off, but farmers 
whose crops were not destroyed benefited 
from the floods. Why?
b.	What information would you need about the 
market for wheat to assess whether ­farmers 
as a group were hurt or helped by the 
floods?
	15.	 Explain why the following might be true:  
A drought around the world raises the total 
revenue that farmers receive from the sale of 
grain, but a drought only in Kansas reduces the 
total revenue that Kansas farmers receive.
