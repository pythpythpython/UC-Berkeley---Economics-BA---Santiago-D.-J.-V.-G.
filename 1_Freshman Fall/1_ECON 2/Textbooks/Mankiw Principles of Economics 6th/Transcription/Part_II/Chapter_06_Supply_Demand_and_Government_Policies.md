Supply, Demand, and
    Government Policies
E
conomists have two roles. As scientists, they develop and test theories to 
explain the world around them. As policy advisers, they use their theo-
ries to help change the world for the better. The focus of the preceding 
two chapters has been scientific. We have seen how supply and demand 
determine the price of a good and the quantity of the good sold. We have also seen 
how various events shift supply and demand and thereby change the equilibrium 
price and quantity.
This chapter offers our first look at policy. Here we analyze various types of 
government policy using only the tools of supply and demand. As you will see, 
the analysis yields some surprising insights. Policies often have effects that their 
architects did not intend or anticipate.
We begin by considering policies that directly control prices. For example, 
rent-control laws dictate a maximum rent that landlords may charge tenants. 
Minimum-wage laws dictate the lowest wage that firms may pay workers. Price

HOW MARKETS WORK
controls are usually enacted when policymakers believe that the market price of a 
good or service is unfair to buyers or sellers. Yet, as we will see, these policies can 
generate inequities of their own. 
After discussing price controls, we consider the impact of taxes. Policymakers 
use taxes to raise revenue for public purposes and to influence market outcomes. 
Although the prevalence of taxes in our economy is obvious, their effects are not. 
For example, when the government levies a tax on the amount that firms pay their 
workers, do the firms or the workers bear the burden of the tax? The answer is not 
at all clear—until we apply the powerful tools of supply and demand.
Controls on Prices
To see how price controls affect market outcomes, let’s look once again at the 
market for ice cream. As we saw in Chapter 4, if ice cream is sold in a competitive 
market free of government regulation, the price of ice cream adjusts to balance 
supply and demand: At the equilibrium price, the quantity of ice cream that buy-
ers want to buy exactly equals the quantity that sellers want to sell. To be concrete, 
suppose the equilibrium price is $3 per cone. 
Not everyone may be happy with the outcome of this free-market process. Let’s 
say the American Association of Ice-Cream Eaters complains that the $3 price is 
too high for everyone to enjoy a cone a day (their recommended daily allowance). 
Meanwhile, the National Organization of Ice-Cream Makers complains that the 
$3 price—the result of “cutthroat competition”—is too low and is depressing the 
incomes of its members. Each of these groups lobbies the government to pass laws 
that alter the market outcome by directly controlling the price of an ice-cream 
cone.
Because buyers of any good always want a lower price while sellers want a 
higher price, the interests of the two groups conflict. If the Ice-Cream Eaters are 
successful in their lobbying, the government imposes a legal maximum on the 
price at which ice-cream cones can be sold. Because the price is not allowed to rise 
above this level, the legislated maximum is called a price ceiling. By contrast, if 
the Ice-Cream Makers are successful, the government imposes a legal minimum 
on the price. Because the price cannot fall below this level, the legislated mini-
mum is called a price floor. Let us consider the effects of these policies in turn.
How Price Ceilings Affect Market Outcomes
When the government, moved by the complaints and campaign contributions of 
the Ice-Cream Eaters, imposes a price ceiling on the market for ice cream, two 
outcomes are possible. In panel (a) of Figure 1, the government imposes a price 
ceiling of $4 per cone. In this case, because the price that balances supply and 
demand ($3) is below the ceiling, the price ceiling is not binding. Market forces 
naturally move the economy to the equilibrium, and the price ceiling has no effect 
on the price or the quantity sold.
Panel (b) of Figure 1 shows the other, more interesting, possibility. In this case, 
the government imposes a price ceiling of $2 per cone. Because the equilibrium 
price of $3 is above the price ceiling, the ceiling is a binding constraint on the mar-
ket. The forces of supply and demand tend to move the price toward the equi-
librium price, but when the market price hits the ceiling, it can, by law, rise no 
further. Thus, the market price equals the price ceiling. At this price, the quantity 
of ice cream demanded (125 cones in the figure) exceeds the quantity supplied

price at which a good can 
be sold

price at which a good can

A Market with a Price 
Ceiling
Figure 1
In panel (a), the government imposes a price ceiling of $4. Because the price ceiling is 
above the equilibrium price of $3, the price ceiling has no effect, and the market can 
reach the equilibrium of supply and demand. In this equilibrium, quantity supplied 
and quantity demanded both equal 100 cones. In panel (b), the government imposes 
a price ceiling of $2. Because the price ceiling is below the equilibrium price of $3, 
the market price equals $2. At this price, 125 cones are demanded and only 75 are 
supplied, so there is a shortage of 50 cones.

(75 cones). There is a shortage: 50 people who want to buy ice cream at the going 
price are unable to do so. 
In response to this shortage, some mechanism for rationing ice cream will 
naturally develop. The mechanism could be long lines: Buyers who are willing 
to arrive early and wait in line get a cone, but those unwilling to wait do not. 
Alternatively, sellers could ration ice-cream cones according to their own personal 
biases, selling them only to friends, relatives, or members of their own racial or 
ethnic group. Notice that even though the price ceiling was motivated by a desire 
to help buyers of ice cream, not all buyers benefit from the policy. Some buyers 
do get to pay a lower price, although they may have to wait in line to do so, but 
other buyers cannot get any ice cream at all.
This example in the market for ice cream shows a general result: When the gov-
ernment imposes a binding price ceiling on a competitive market, a shortage of the good 
arises, and sellers must ration the scarce goods among the large number of potential buy-
ers. The rationing mechanisms that develop under price ceilings are rarely desir-
able. Long lines are inefficient because they waste buyers’ time. Discrimination 
according to seller bias is both inefficient (because the good does not necessarily 
go to the buyer who values it most highly) and potentially unfair. By contrast, the 
rationing mechanism in a free, competitive market is both efficient and imper-
sonal. When the market for ice cream reaches its equilibrium, anyone who wants 
to pay the market price can get a cone. Free markets ration goods with prices.

HOW MARKETS WORK
Lines at the Gas Pump
As we discussed in the preceding chapter, in 1973 the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC) raised the price of crude oil in world oil markets. 
Because crude oil is the major input used to make gasoline, the higher oil prices 
reduced the supply of gasoline. Long lines at gas stations became commonplace, 
and motorists often had to wait for hours to buy only a few gallons of gas.
What was responsible for the long gas lines? Most people blame OPEC. Surely, 
if OPEC had not raised the price of crude oil, the shortage of gasoline would not 
have occurred. Yet economists blame U.S. government regulations that limited 
the price oil companies could charge for gasoline.
Figure 2 shows what happened. As shown in panel (a), before OPEC raised the 
price of crude oil, the equilibrium price of gasoline, P1, was below the price ceil-
ing. The price regulation, therefore, had no effect. When the price of crude oil rose, 
however, the situation changed. The increase in the price of crude oil raised the 
cost of producing gasoline, and this reduced the supply of gasoline. As panel (b) 
shows, the supply curve shifted to the left from S1 to S2. In an unregulated market, 
this shift in supply would have raised the equilibrium price of gasoline from P1 
to P2, and no shortage would have resulted. Instead, the price ceiling prevented 
the price from rising to the equilibrium level. At the price ceiling, producers were 
Panel (a) shows the gasoline market when the price ceiling is not binding because 
the equilibrium price, P1, is below the ceiling. Panel (b) shows the gasoline market 
after an increase in the price of crude oil (an input into making gasoline) shifts the 
supply curve to the left from S1 to S2. In an unregulated market, the price would have 
risen from P1 to P2. The price ceiling, however, prevents this from happening. At the 
binding price ceiling, consumers are willing to buy QD, but producers of gasoline 
are willing to sell only QS. The difference between quantity demanded and quantity 
supplied, QD – QS, measures the gasoline shortage.

willing to sell QS, and consumers were willing to buy QD. Thus, the shift in supply 
caused a severe shortage at the regulated price.
Eventually, the laws regulating the price of gasoline were repealed. Lawmakers 
came to understand that they were partly responsible for the many hours Ameri-
cans lost waiting in line to buy gasoline. Today, when the price of crude oil changes, 
the price of gasoline can adjust to bring supply and demand into equilibrium.  ■
Rent Control in the Short Run 
and the Long Run
One common example of a price ceiling is rent control. In many cities, the local 
government places a ceiling on rents that landlords may charge their tenants. The 
goal of this policy is to help the poor by making housing more affordable. Econo-
mists often criticize rent control, arguing that it is a highly inefficient way to help 
the poor raise their standard of living. One economist called rent control “the best 
way to destroy a city, other than bombing.”
The adverse effects of rent control are less apparent to the general population 
because these effects occur over many years. In the short run, landlords have a 
fixed number of apartments to rent, and they cannot adjust this number quickly as 
market conditions change. Moreover, the number of people searching for housing 
in a city may not be highly responsive to rents in the short run because people take 
time to adjust their housing arrangements. Therefore, the short-run supply and 
demand for housing are relatively inelastic. 
Panel (a) of Figure 3 shows the short-run effects of rent control on the ­housing 
market. As with any binding price ceiling, rent control causes a shortage. Yet because

Panel (a) shows the short-run effects of rent control: Because the supply and demand

effects of rent control: Because the supply and demand curves for apartments are 
more elastic, rent control causes a large shortage.

HOW MARKETS WORK
supply and demand are inelastic in the short run, the initial shortage caused by rent 
control is small. The primary effect in the short run is to reduce rents.
The long-run story is very different because the buyers and sellers of rental 
housing respond more to market conditions as time passes. On the supply side, 
landlords respond to low rents by not building new apartments and by failing to 
maintain existing ones. On the demand side, low rents encourage people to find 
their own apartments (rather than living with their parents or sharing apartments 
with roommates) and induce more people to move into a city. Therefore, both 
supply and demand are more elastic in the long run. 
Panel (b) of Figure 3 illustrates the housing market in the long run. When rent 
control depresses rents below the equilibrium level, the quantity of apartments 
supplied falls substantially, and the quantity of apartments demanded rises sub-
stantially. The result is a large shortage of housing.
In cities with rent control, landlords use various mechanisms to ration hous-
ing. Some landlords keep long waiting lists. Others give a preference to tenants 
without children. Still others discriminate on the basis of race. Sometimes apart-
ments are allocated to those willing to offer under-the-table payments to building 
superintendents. In essence, these bribes bring the total price of an apartment 
(including the bribe) closer to the equilibrium price.
To understand fully the effects of rent control, we have to remember one of the 
Ten Principles of Economics from Chapter 1: People respond to incentives. In free 
markets, landlords try to keep their buildings clean and safe because desirable 
apartments command higher prices. By contrast, when rent control creates short-
ages and waiting lists, landlords lose their incentive to respond to tenants’ con-
cerns. Why should a landlord spend money to maintain and improve the property 
when people are waiting to get in as it is? In the end, tenants get lower rents, but 
they also get lower-quality housing.
Policymakers often react to the effects of rent control by imposing additional 
regulations. For example, various laws make racial discrimination in housing ille-
gal and require landlords to provide minimally adequate living conditions. These 
laws, however, are difficult and costly to enforce. By contrast, when rent control 
is eliminated and a market for housing is regulated by the forces of competition, 
such laws are less necessary. In a free market, the price of housing adjusts to elimi-
nate the shortages that give rise to undesirable landlord behavior.  ■
How Price Floors Affect Market Outcomes
To examine the effects of another kind of government price control, let’s return 
to the market for ice cream. Imagine now that the government is persuaded by 
the pleas of the National Organization of Ice-Cream Makers whose members feel 
the $3 equilibrium price is too low. In this case, the government might institute a 
price floor. Price floors, like price ceilings, are an attempt by the government to 
maintain prices at other than equilibrium levels. Whereas a price ceiling places a 
legal maximum on prices, a price floor places a legal minimum.
When the government imposes a price floor on the ice-cream market, two out-
comes are possible. If the government imposes a price floor of $2 per cone when 
the equilibrium price is $3, we obtain the outcome in panel (a) of Figure 4. In this 
case, because the equilibrium price is above the floor, the price floor is not bind-
ing. Market forces naturally move the economy to the equilibrium, and the price 
floor has no effect.
Panel (b) of Figure 4 shows what happens when the government imposes a 
price floor of $4 per cone. In this case, because the equilibrium price of $3 is below

A Market with a Price 
Floor
Figure 4
In panel (a), the government imposes a price floor of $2. Because this is below the 
equilibrium price of $3, the price floor has no effect. The market price adjusts to 
balance supply and demand. At the equilibrium, quantity supplied and quantity 
demanded both equal 100 cones. In panel (b), the government imposes a price floor 
of $4, which is above the equilibrium price of $3. Therefore, the market price equals 
$4. Because 120 cones are supplied at this price and only 80 are demanded, there is a 
surplus of 40 cones.

the floor, the price floor is a binding constraint on the market. The forces of sup-
ply and demand tend to move the price toward the equilibrium price, but when 
the market price hits the floor, it can fall no further. The market price equals the 
price floor. At this floor, the quantity of ice cream supplied (120 cones) exceeds 
the quantity demanded (80 cones). Some people who want to sell ice cream at the 
going price are unable to. Thus, a binding price floor causes a surplus. 
Just as the shortages resulting from price ceilings can lead to undesirable 
rationing mechanisms, so can the surpluses resulting from price floors. In the 
case of a price floor, some sellers are unable to sell all they want at the market 
price. The sellers who appeal to the personal biases of the buyers, perhaps due to 
racial or familial ties, are better able to sell their goods than those who do not. By 
contrast, in a free market, the price serves as the rationing mechanism, and sellers 
can sell all they want at the equilibrium price.  
The Minimum Wage
An important example of a price floor is the minimum wage. Minimum-wage 
laws dictate the lowest price for labor that any employer may pay. The U.S. 
­Congress first instituted a minimum wage with the Fair Labor Standards Act 
of 1938 to ensure workers a minimally adequate standard of living. In 2009, 
the minimum wage according to federal law was $7.25 per hour. (Some states

mandate minimum wages above the federal level.) Most European nations have 
­minimum-wage laws as well; some, such as France and the United Kingdom, 
have significantly higher minimums than the United States.
To examine the effects of a minimum wage, we must consider the market for 
labor. Panel (a) of Figure 5 shows the labor market, which, like all markets, is sub-
ject to the forces of supply and demand. Workers determine the supply of labor, 
and firms determine the demand.  If the government doesn’t intervene, the wage 
normally adjusts to balance labor supply and labor demand.
Panel (b) of Figure 5 shows the labor market with a minimum wage. If the 
minimum wage is above the equilibrium level, as it is here, the quantity of labor 
supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. The result is unemployment. Thus, the 
minimum wage raises the incomes of those workers who have jobs, but it lowers 
the incomes of workers who cannot find jobs. 
To fully understand the minimum wage, keep in mind that the economy 
contains not a single labor market but many labor markets for different types of 
workers. The impact of the minimum wage depends on the skill and experience of 
the worker. Highly skilled and experienced workers are not affected because their 
equilibrium wages are well above the minimum. For these workers, the minimum 
wage is not binding.
The minimum wage has its greatest impact on the market for teenage labor. 
The equilibrium wages of teenagers are low because teenagers are among the least 
skilled and least experienced members of the labor force. In addition, teenagers 
are often willing to accept a lower wage in exchange for on‑the‑job training. (Some 
teenagers are willing to work as “interns” for no pay at all. Because internships 
pay nothing, however, the minimum wage does not apply to them. If it did, these 
Panel (a) shows a labor market in which the wage adjusts to balance labor supply 
and labor demand. Panel (b) shows the impact of a binding minimum wage. Because 
the minimum wage is a price floor, it causes a surplus: The quantity of labor supplied 
exceeds the quantity demanded. The result is unemployment.

CHAPTER 6   Supply, Demand, and Government Policies
jobs might not exist.) As a result, the minimum wage is more often binding for 
teenagers than for other members of the labor force.
Many economists have studied how minimum-wage laws affect the teenage 
labor market. These researchers compare the changes in the minimum wage over 
time with the changes in teenage employment. Although there is some debate 
about how much the minimum wage affects employment, the typical study finds 
that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage depresses teenage employment 
between 1 and 3 percent. In interpreting this estimate, note that a 10 percent 
increase in the minimum wage does not raise the average wage of teenagers 
by 10 percent. A change in the law does not directly affect those teenagers who 
are already paid well above the minimum, and enforcement of minimum-wage 
laws is not perfect. Thus, the estimated drop in employment of 1 to 3 percent is 
­significant. 
In addition to altering the quantity of labor demanded, the minimum wage 
alters the quantity supplied. Because the minimum wage raises the wage that 
teenagers can earn, it increases the number of teenagers who choose to look for 
jobs. Studies have found that a higher minimum wage influences which ­teenagers 
are employed. When the minimum wage rises, some teenagers who are still 
attending high school choose to drop out and take jobs. These new dropouts 
displace other teenagers who had already dropped out of school and who now 
become unemployed. 
The minimum wage is a frequent topic of debate. Economists are about evenly 
divided on the issue. In a 2006 survey of Ph.D. economists, 47 percent favored 
eliminating the minimum wage, while 14 percent would maintain it at its current 
level and 38 percent would increase it. 
Advocates of the minimum wage view the policy as one way to raise the 
income of the working poor. They correctly point out that workers who earn the 
minimum wage can afford only a meager standard of living.  In 2009, for instance, 
when the minimum wage was $7.25 per hour, two adults working 40 hours a 
week for every week of the year at minimum-wage jobs had a total annual income 
of only $30,160, which was less than two-thirds of the median family income in 
the United States. Many advocates of the minimum wage admit that it has some 
adverse effects, including unemployment, but they believe that these effects are 
small and that, all things considered, a higher minimum wage makes the poor 
better off.
Opponents of the minimum wage contend that it is not the best way to combat 
poverty. They note that a high minimum wage causes unemployment, encour-
ages teenagers to drop out of school, and prevents some unskilled workers from 
getting the on-the-job training they need. Moreover, opponents of the minimum 
wage point out that it is a poorly targeted policy. Not all minimum-wage workers 
are heads of households trying to help their families escape poverty. In fact, fewer 
than a third of minimum-wage earners are in families with incomes below the 
poverty line. Many are teenagers from middle‑class homes working at part-time 
jobs for extra spending money.  ■
Evaluating Price Controls
One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that markets are 
usually a good way to organize economic activity. This principle explains why 
economists usually oppose price ceilings and price floors. To economists, prices 
are not the outcome of some haphazard process. Prices, they contend, are the

 Should Unpaid Internships Be Allowed?

ith job openings scarce for young 
people, the number of unpaid intern-
ships has climbed in recent years, leading 
federal and state regulators to worry that 
more employers are illegally using such 
internships for free labor. 
	
Convinced that many unpaid intern-
ships violate minimum wage laws, officials 
in Oregon, California and other states have 
begun investigations and fined employers. 
Last year, M. Patricia Smith, then New York’s 
labor commissioner, ordered investigations 
into several firms’ internships. Now, as the fed-
eral Labor Department’s top law enforcement 
official, she and the wage and hour division 
are stepping up enforcement nationwide…. 
	
The Labor Department says it is crack-
ing down on firms that fail to pay interns 
properly and expanding efforts to educate 
companies, colleges and students on the 
law regarding internships. 
	
“If you’re a for-profit employer or 
you want to pursue an internship with a 
for-profit employer, there aren’t going to be 
many circumstances where you can have 
an internship and not be paid and still be 
in compliance with the law,” said Nancy J. 
Leppink, the acting director of the depart-
ment’s wage and hour division. 
Note from the author: The rules dis-
cussed in this article are being applied to 
for-profit firms but not to government.

those at congressional offices, are unpaid.

result of the millions of business and consumer decisions that lie behind the 
supply and demand curves. Prices have the crucial job of balancing supply and 
demand and, thereby, coordinating economic activity. When policymakers set 
prices by legal decree, they obscure the signals that normally guide the allocation 
of society’s resources.
Another one of the Ten Principles of Economics is that governments can some-
times improve market outcomes. Indeed, policymakers are led to control prices 
because they view the market’s outcome as unfair. Price controls are often aimed 
at helping the poor. For instance, rent-control laws try to make housing affordable 
for everyone, and minimum-wage laws try to help people escape poverty.
Yet price controls often hurt those they are trying to help. Rent control may 
keep rents low, but it also discourages landlords from maintaining their buildings 
and makes housing hard to find. Minimum-wage laws may raise the incomes of 
some workers, but they also cause other workers to be unemployed. 
Helping those in need can be accomplished in ways other than controlling 
prices. For instance, the government can make housing more affordable by 
paying a fraction of the rent for poor families. Unlike rent control, such rent 
subsidies do not reduce the quantity of housing supplied and, therefore, do not 
lead to ­housing shortages. Similarly, wage subsidies raise the living standards 
of the working poor without discouraging firms from hiring them. An example

of a wage ­subsidy is the earned income tax credit, a government program that 
­supplements the incomes of low-wage workers.
Although these alternative policies are often better than price controls, they are 
not perfect. Rent and wage subsidies cost the government money and, therefore, 
require higher taxes. As we see in the next section, taxation has costs of its own.

Taxes
All governments—from the federal government in Washington, D.C., to the local 
governments in small towns—use taxes to raise revenue for public projects, such 
as roads, schools, and national defense. Because taxes are such an important 
policy instrument, and because they affect our lives in many ways, we return to 
the study of taxes several times throughout this book. In this section, we begin our 
study of how taxes affect the economy.
To set the stage for our analysis, imagine that a local government decides to 
hold an annual ice-cream celebration—with a parade, fireworks, and speeches by 
town officials. To raise revenue to pay for the event, the town decides to place a 
$0.50 tax on the sale of ice-cream cones. When the plan is announced, our two lob-
bying groups swing into action.  The American Association of Ice-Cream Eaters 
claims that consumers of ice cream are having trouble making ends meet, and it 
argues that sellers of ice cream should pay the tax. The National Organization of 
Ice-Cream Makers claims that its members are struggling to survive in a competi-
tive market, and it argues that buyers of ice cream should pay the tax. The town 
mayor, hoping to reach a compromise, suggests that half the tax be paid by the 
buyers and half be paid by the sellers.
To analyze these proposals, we need to address a simple but subtle question: 
When the government levies a tax on a good, who actually bears the burden of the 
tax? The people buying the good? The people selling the good? Or if buyers and 
sellers share the tax burden, what determines how the burden is divided? Can the 
government simply legislate the division of the burden, as the mayor is suggest-
ing, or is the division determined by more fundamental market forces? The term 
tax incidence refers to how the burden of a tax is distributed among the various 
people who make up the economy. As we will see, some surprising lessons about 
tax incidence can be learned by applying the tools of supply and demand. 
How Taxes on Sellers Affect Market Outcomes
We begin by considering a tax levied on sellers of a good. Suppose the local gov-
ernment passes a law requiring sellers of ice-cream cones to send $0.50 to the gov-
ernment for each cone they sell. How does this law affect the buyers and sellers of 
ice cream? To answer this question, we can follow the three steps in Chapter 4 for 
analyzing supply and demand: (1) We decide whether the law affects the supply 
curve or demand curve. (2) We decide which way the curve shifts. (3) We examine 
how the shift affects the equilibrium price and quantity.
Step One  The immediate impact of the tax is on the sellers of ice cream. 
Because the tax is not levied on buyers, the quantity of ice cream demanded at 
any given price is the same; thus, the demand curve does not change. By contrast,

HOW MARKETS WORK
the tax on sellers makes the ice-cream business less profitable at any given price, 
so it shifts the supply curve.
Step Two  Because the tax on sellers raises the cost of producing and selling ice 
cream, it reduces the quantity supplied at every price. The supply curve shifts to 
the left (or, equivalently, upward).
In addition to determining the direction in which the supply curve moves, we 
can also be precise about the size of the shift. For any market price of ice cream, 
the effective price to sellers—the amount they get to keep after paying the tax—is 
$0.50 lower. For example, if the market price of a cone happened to be $2.00, the 
effective price received by sellers would be $1.50. Whatever the market price, sell-
ers will supply a quantity of ice cream as if the price were $0.50 lower than it is. 
Put differently, to induce sellers to supply any given quantity, the market price 
must now be $0.50 higher to compensate for the effect of the tax. Thus, as shown 
in Figure 6, the supply curve shifts upward from S1 to S2 by the exact size of the 
tax ($0.50).
Step Three   Having determined how the supply curve shifts, we can now com-
pare the initial and the new equilibriums. The figure shows that the equilibrium 
price of ice cream rises from $3.00 to $3.30, and the equilibrium quantity falls from 
100 to 90 cones. Because sellers sell less and buyers buy less in the new equilib-
rium, the tax reduces the size of the ice-cream market. 
Implications  We can now return to the question of tax incidence: Who pays 
the tax? Although sellers send the entire tax to the government, buyers and sell-
ers share the burden. Because the market price rises from $3.00 to $3.30 when the 
tax is introduced, buyers pay $0.30 more for each ice-cream cone than they did 
without the tax. Thus, the tax makes buyers worse off. Sellers get a higher price 
($3.30) from buyers than they did previously, but the effective price after paying 
the tax falls from $3.00 before the tax to $2.80 with the tax ($3.30 – $0.50 = $2.80). 
Thus, the tax also makes sellers worse off.

When a tax of $0.50 is levied on 
sellers, the supply curve shifts up by 
$0.50 from S1 to S2. The equilibrium 
quantity falls from 100 to 90 cones. 
The price that buyers pay rises from 
$3.00 to $3.30. The price that sellers 
receive (after paying the tax) falls 
from $3.00 to $2.80. Even though the 
tax is levied on sellers, buyers and 
sellers share the burden of the tax.

CHAPTER 6   Supply, Demand, and Government Policies
To sum up, this analysis yields two lessons:
• 	 Taxes discourage market activity. When a good is taxed, the quantity of the 
good sold is smaller in the new equilibrium.
• 	 Buyers and sellers share the burden of taxes. In the new equilibrium, buyers 
pay more for the good, and sellers receive less.
How Taxes on Buyers Affect Market Outcomes
Now consider a tax levied on buyers of a good. Suppose that our local govern-
ment passes a law requiring buyers of ice-cream cones to send $0.50 to the govern-
ment for each ice-cream cone they buy. What are the effects of this law? Again, 
we apply our three steps.
Step One  The initial impact of the tax is on the demand for ice cream. The sup-
ply curve is not affected because, for any given price of ice cream, sellers have the 
same incentive to provide ice cream to the market. By contrast, buyers now have 
to pay a tax to the government (as well as the price to the sellers) whenever they 
buy ice cream. Thus, the tax shifts the demand curve for ice cream. 
Step Two  We next determine the direction of the shift. Because the tax on 
buyers makes buying ice cream less attractive, buyers demand a smaller quantity 
of ice cream at every price. As a result, the demand curve shifts to the left (or, 
equivalently, downward), as shown in Figure 7.
Once again, we can be precise about the size of the shift.  Because of the $0.50 
tax levied on buyers, the effective price to buyers is now $0.50 higher than the 
market price (whatever the market price happens to be). For example, if the 
market price of a cone happened to be $2.00, the effective price to buyers would 
be $2.50. Because buyers look at their total cost including the tax, they demand a 
quantity of ice cream as if the market price were $0.50 higher than it actually is. 
In other words, to induce buyers to demand any given quantity, the market price

When a tax of $0.50 is levied 
on buyers, the demand curve 
shifts down by $0.50 from

quantity falls from 100 to

sellers receive falls from 
$3.00 to $2.80. The price that 
buyers pay (including the 
tax) rises from $3.00 to $3.30. 
Even though the tax is levied 
on buyers, buyers and sellers

HOW MARKETS WORK
must now be $0.50 lower to make up for the effect of the tax. Thus, the tax shifts 
the demand curve downward from D1 to D2 by the exact size of the tax ($0.50). 
Step Three  Having determined how the demand curve shifts, we can now 
see the effect of the tax by comparing the initial equilibrium and the new equi-
librium. You can see in the figure that the equilibrium price of ice cream falls 
from $3.00 to $2.80, and the equilibrium quantity falls from 100 to 90 cones. Once 
again, the tax on ice cream reduces the size of the ice-cream market.  And once 
again, buyers and sellers share the burden of the tax. Sellers get a lower price 
for their product; buyers pay a lower market price to sellers than they did previ-
ously, but the effective price (including the tax buyers have to pay) rises from 
$3.00 to $3.30.
Implications  If you compare Figures 6 and 7, you will notice a surprising 
conclusion: Taxes levied on sellers and taxes levied on buyers are equivalent. In both 
cases, the tax places a wedge between the price that buyers pay and the price that 
sellers receive. The wedge between the buyers’ price and the sellers’ price is the 
same, regardless of whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers. In either case, 
the wedge shifts the relative position of the supply and demand curves. In the 
new equilibrium, buyers and sellers share the burden of the tax. The only differ-
ence between taxes on sellers and taxes on buyers is who sends the money to the 
government.
The equivalence of these two taxes is easy to understand if we imagine that the 
government collects the $0.50 ice-cream tax in a bowl on the counter of each ice-
cream store.  When the government levies the tax on sellers, the seller is required 
to place $0.50 in the bowl after the sale of each cone. When the government levies 
the tax on buyers, the buyer is required to place $0.50 in the bowl every time a 
cone is bought. Whether the $0.50 goes directly from the buyer’s pocket into the 
bowl, or indirectly from the buyer’s pocket into the seller’s hand and then into the 
bowl, does not matter. Once the market reaches its new equilibrium, buyers and 
sellers share the burden, regardless of how the tax is levied.
Can Congress Distribute the Burden of a 
Payroll Tax?
If you have ever received a paycheck, you probably noticed that taxes were 
deducted from the amount you earned. One of these taxes is called FICA, an 
acronym for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. The federal government 
uses the revenue from the FICA tax to pay for Social Security and Medicare, the 
income support and healthcare programs for the elderly. FICA is an example of a 
payroll tax, which is a tax on the wages that firms pay their workers. In 2010, the 
total FICA tax for the typical worker was 15.3 percent of earnings. 
Who do you think bears the burden of this payroll tax—firms or workers? 
When Congress passed this legislation, it tried to mandate a division of the tax 
burden. According to the law, half of the tax is paid by firms, and half is paid by 
workers. That is, half of the tax is paid out of firms’ revenues, and half is deducted 
from workers’ paychecks. The amount that shows up as a deduction on your pay 
stub is the worker contribution.
Our analysis of tax incidence, however, shows that lawmakers cannot so 
easily dictate the distribution of a tax burden. To illustrate, we can analyze a 
payroll tax as merely a tax on a good, where the good is labor and the price is

CHAPTER 6   Supply, Demand, and Government Policies
the wage. The key feature of the payroll tax is that it places a wedge between 
the wage that firms pay and the wage that workers receive. Figure 8 shows the 
outcome. When a payroll tax is enacted, the wage received by workers falls, and 
the wage paid by firms rises. In the end, workers and firms share the burden 
of the tax, much as the legislation requires. Yet this division of the tax burden 
between workers and firms has nothing to do with the legislated division: The 
division of the burden in Figure 8 is not necessarily fifty-fifty, and the same 
outcome would prevail if the law levied the entire tax on workers or if it levied 
the entire tax on firms.
This example shows that the most basic lesson of tax incidence is often over-
looked in public debate. Lawmakers can decide whether a tax comes from the 
buyer’s pocket or from the seller’s, but they cannot legislate the true burden of a 
tax. Rather, tax incidence depends on the forces of supply and demand.  ■
Elasticity and Tax Incidence
When a good is taxed, buyers and sellers of the good share the burden of the tax. 
But how exactly is the tax burden divided? Only rarely will it be shared equally. 
To see how the burden is divided, consider the impact of taxation in the two 
markets in Figure 9. In both cases, the figure shows the initial demand curve, the 
initial supply curve, and a tax that drives a wedge between the amount paid by 
buyers and the amount received by sellers. (Not drawn in either panel of the fig-
ure is the new supply or demand curve. Which curve shifts depends on whether 
the tax is levied on buyers or sellers. As we have seen, this is irrelevant for the 
incidence of the tax.) The difference in the two panels is the relative elasticity of 
supply and demand. 
Panel (a) of Figure 9 shows a tax in a market with very elastic supply and rela-
tively inelastic demand. That is, sellers are very responsive to changes in the price 
of the good (so the supply curve is relatively flat), whereas buyers are not very 
responsive (so the demand curve is relatively steep). When a tax is imposed on a 
Figure 8
A Payroll Tax
A payroll tax places a wedge between 
the wage that workers receive and the 
wage that firms pay. Comparing wages 
with and without the tax, you can see 
that workers and firms share the tax 
burden. This division of the tax burden 
between workers and firms does not 
depend on whether the government 
levies the tax on workers, levies the 
tax on firms, or divides the tax equally 
between the two groups.

In panel (a), the supply curve is elastic,

this case, the price received by sellers 
falls only slightly, while the price paid

buyers bear most of the burden of 
the tax. In panel (b), the supply curve

elastic. In this case, the price received 
by sellers falls substantially, while the 
price paid by buyers rises only slightly.

CHAPTER 6   Supply, Demand, and Government Policies
The two panels of Figure 9 show a general lesson about how the burden of 
a tax is divided: A tax burden falls more heavily on the side of the market that is 
less elastic. Why is this true? In essence, the elasticity measures the willingness 
of buyers or sellers to leave the market when conditions become unfavorable. 
A small elasticity of demand means that buyers do not have good alternatives 
to consuming this particular good. A small elasticity of supply means that 
sellers do not have good alternatives to producing this particular good. When 
the good is taxed, the side of the market with fewer good alternatives is less 
willing to leave the market and must, therefore, bear more of the burden of 
the tax.
We can apply this logic to the payroll tax discussed in the previous case study. 
Most labor economists believe that the supply of labor is much less elastic than 
the demand. This means that workers, rather than firms, bear most of the burden 
of the payroll tax. In other words, the distribution of the tax burden is not at all 
close to the fifty-fifty split that lawmakers intended.
Who Pays the Luxury Tax?
In 1990, Congress adopted a new luxury tax on items such as yachts, private 
airplanes, furs, jewelry, and expensive cars. The goal of the tax was to raise 
revenue from those who could most easily afford to pay. Because only the rich 
could afford to buy such extravagances, taxing luxuries seemed a logical way 
of taxing the rich.
Yet, when the forces of supply and demand took over, the outcome was quite 
different from the one Congress intended. Consider, for example, the market for 
yachts. The demand for yachts is quite elastic. A millionaire can easily not buy a 
yacht; she can use the money to buy a bigger house, take a European vacation, or 
leave a larger bequest to her heirs. By contrast, the supply of yachts is relatively 
inelastic, at least in the short run. Yacht factories are not easily converted to 
alternative uses, and workers who build yachts are not eager to change careers in 
response to changing market conditions. 
Our analysis makes a clear prediction in this case. With elastic demand and 
inelastic supply, the burden of a tax falls largely on the suppliers. That is, a tax on 
yachts places a burden largely on the firms and workers who build yachts because 
they end up getting a significantly lower price for their product. The workers, 
however, are not wealthy. Thus, the burden of a luxury tax falls more on the 
middle class than on the rich.
The mistaken assumptions about the incidence of the luxury tax quickly 
became apparent after the tax went into effect. Suppliers of luxuries made their 
congressional representatives well aware of the economic hardship they experi-
enced, and Congress repealed most of the luxury tax in 1993.  ■

Conclusion
The economy is governed by two kinds of laws: the laws of supply and demand 
and the laws enacted by governments. In this chapter, we have begun to see how 
these laws interact. Price controls and taxes are common in various markets in 
the economy, and their effects are frequently debated in the press and among 
policymakers. Even a little bit of economic knowledge can go a long way toward 
understanding and evaluating these policies.
In subsequent chapters, we analyze many government policies in greater 
detail. We examine the effects of taxation more fully and consider a broader range 
of policies than we considered here. Yet the basic lessons of this chapter will not 
change: When analyzing government policies, supply and demand are the first 
and most useful tools of analysis.

price floor, p. 112
tax incidence, p. 121
• A price ceiling is a legal maximum on the price 
of a good or service. An example is rent control. 
If the price ceiling is below the equilibrium price, 
then the price ceiling is binding, and the quantity 
demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. Because 
of the resulting shortage, sellers must in some way 
ration the good or service among buyers.
• A price floor is a legal minimum on the price of 
a good or service. An example is the ­minimum 
wage. If the price floor is above the ­equilibrium 
price, then the price floor is binding, and the quan-
tity supplied exceeds the quantity ­demanded. 
Because of the resulting surplus, buyers’ demands 
for the good or service must in some way be 
rationed among sellers.
• When the government levies a tax on a good, 
the equilibrium quantity of the good falls. That 
is, a tax on a market shrinks the size of the 
market.
• A tax on a good places a wedge between the 
price paid by buyers and the price received 
by sellers. When the market moves to the new 
equilibrium, buyers pay more for the good and 
sellers receive less for it. In this sense, buyers 
and sellers share the tax burden. The incidence 
of a tax (that is, the division of the tax burden) 
does not depend on whether the tax is levied on 
buyers or sellers.
• The incidence of a tax depends on the price 
elasticities of supply and demand. Most of the 
burden falls on the side of the market that is 
less elastic because that side of the market can 
respond less easily to the tax by changing the 
quantity bought or sold.

market for beer without the tax. Show the 
price paid by consumers, the price received 
by producers, and the quantity of beer sold. 
What is the difference between the price 
paid by consumers and the price received by 
producers?
b.	Now draw a supply-and-demand diagram 
for the beer market with the tax. Show the 
price paid by consumers, the price received 
by producers, and the quantity of beer sold. 
What is the difference between the price 
paid by consumers and the price received 
by producers? Has the quantity of beer sold 
increased or decreased?
	 5.	 A senator wants to raise tax revenue and make 
workers better off. A staff member proposes 
raising the payroll tax paid by firms and using 
part of the extra revenue to reduce the payroll 
Problems and Applications
	 5.	 Suppose the government removes a tax on 
­buyers of a good and levies a tax of the same 
size on sellers of the good. How does this 
change in tax policy affect the price that  
buyers pay sellers for this good, the amount 
buyers are out of pocket including the tax, the 
amount sellers receive net of the tax, and the 
quantity of the good sold?
	 6.	 How does a tax on a good affect the price paid 
by buyers, the price received by sellers, and the 
quantity sold?
	 7.	 What determines how the burden of a tax is 
divided between buyers and sellers? Why?

tax paid by workers. Would this accomplish 
the senator’s goal? Explain.
	 6.	 If the government places a $500 tax on luxury 
cars, will the price paid by consumers rise by 
more than $500, less than $500, or exactly $500? 
Explain.
	 7.	 Congress and the president decide that the 
United States should reduce air pollution by 
reducing its use of gasoline. They impose a 
$0.50 tax for each gallon of gasoline sold.
a.	 Should they impose this tax on producers 
or consumers? Explain carefully using a 
supply-and-demand diagram.
b.	If the demand for gasoline were more elas-
tic, would this tax be more effective or less 
effective in reducing the quantity of gasoline 
consumed? Explain with both words and a 
diagram.
c.	 Are consumers of gasoline helped or hurt by 
this tax? Why?
d.	Are workers in the oil industry helped or 
hurt by this tax? Why?
	 8.	 A case study in this chapter discusses the fed-
eral minimum-wage law. 
a.	 Suppose the minimum wage is above 
the equilibrium wage in the market 
for unskilled labor. Using a supply-
and-demand diagram of the market for 
unskilled labor, show the market wage, 
the number of workers who are employed, 
and the number of workers who are unem-
ployed. Also show the total wage pay-
ments to unskilled workers.
b.	Now suppose the secretary of labor proposes 
an increase in the minimum wage. What 
effect would this increase have on employ-
ment? Does the change in employment 
depend on the elasticity of demand, the elas-
ticity of supply, both elasticities, or neither?
c.	 What effect would this increase in the mini-
mum wage have on unemployment? Does 
the change in unemployment depend on the 
elasticity of demand, the elasticity of supply, 
both elasticities, or neither?
d.	If the demand for unskilled labor were 
inelastic, would the proposed increase in the 
minimum wage raise or lower total wage 
payments to unskilled workers? Would your 
answer change if the demand for unskilled 
labor were elastic?
	 9.	 The U.S. government administers two pro-
grams that affect the market for cigarettes. 
Media campaigns and labeling requirements 
are aimed at making the public aware of the 
dangers of cigarette smoking. At the same 
time, the Department of Agriculture maintains 
a price-support program for tobacco farmers, 
which raises the price of tobacco above the 
equili­brium price.
a.	 How do these two programs affect cigarette 
consumption? Use a graph of the cigarette 
market in your answer.
b.	What is the combined effect of these two 
programs on the price of cigarettes?
c.	 Cigarettes are also heavily taxed. What effect 
does this tax have on cigarette consumption?
	10.	 At Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox, 
seating is limited to 39,000. Hence, the number 
of tickets issued is fixed at that figure. Seeing a 
golden opportunity to raise revenue, the City of 
Boston levies a per ticket tax of $5 to be paid by 
the ticket buyer. Boston sports fans, a famously 
civic-minded lot, dutifully send in the $5 per 
ticket. Draw a well-labeled graph showing the 
impact of the tax. On whom does the tax burden 
fall—the team’s owners, the fans, or both? Why?
	11.	 A subsidy is the opposite of a tax. With a $0.50 
tax on the buyers of ice-cream cones, the gov-
ernment collects $0.50 for each cone purchased; 
with a $0.50 subsidy for the buyers of ice-cream 
cones, the government pays buyers $0.50 for 
each cone purchased.
a.	 Show the effect of a $0.50 per cone subsidy 
on the demand curve for ice-cream cones, 
the effective price paid by consumers, the 
effective price received by sellers, and the 
quantity of cones sold.
b.	Do consumers gain or lose from this policy? 
Do producers gain or lose? Does the govern-
ment gain or lose?
	12.	 In the spring of 2008, Senators John McCain 
and Hillary Clinton (who were then running 
for president) proposed a temporary elimina-
tion of the federal gasoline tax, effective only 
during the summer of 2008, in order to help 
consumers deal with high gasoline prices.

CHAPTER 6   Supply, Demand, and Government Policies
a.	 During the summer, when gasoline demand 
is high because of vacation driving, gasoline 
refiners are operating near full capacity.  
What does this fact suggest about the price 
elasticity of supply?
b.	In light of your answer to (a), who do you 
predict would benefit from the temporary 
gas tax holiday?
