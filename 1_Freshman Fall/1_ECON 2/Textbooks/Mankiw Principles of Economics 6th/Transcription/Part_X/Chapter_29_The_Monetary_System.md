hen you walk into a restaurant to buy a meal, you get something of 
value—a full stomach. To pay for this service, you might hand the 
restaurateur several worn-out pieces of greenish paper decorated 
with strange symbols, government buildings, and the portraits of 
famous dead Americans. Or you might hand him a single piece of paper with the 
name of a bank and your signature. Whether you pay by cash or check, the restau-
rateur is happy to work hard to satisfy your gastronomical desires in exchange for 
these pieces of paper which, in and of themselves, are worthless.
To anyone who has lived in a modern economy, this social custom is not at all 
odd. Even though paper money has no intrinsic value, the restaurateur is confi-
dent that, in the future, some third person will accept it in exchange for something 
that the restaurateur does value. And that third person is confident that some 
fourth person will accept the money, with the knowledge that yet a fifth person

will accept the money . . . and so on. To the restaurateur and to other people in our 
society, your cash or check represents a claim to goods and services in the future.
The social custom of using money for transactions is extraordinarily useful in 
a large, complex society. Imagine, for a moment, that there was no item in the 
economy widely accepted in exchange for goods and services. People would have 
to rely on barter—the exchange of one good or service for another—to obtain the 
things they need. To get your restaurant meal, for instance, you would have to 
offer the restaurateur something of immediate value. You could offer to wash 
some dishes, clean his car, or give him your family’s secret recipe for meat loaf. 
An economy that relies on barter will have trouble allocating its scarce resources 
efficiently. In such an economy, trade is said to require the double coincidence of 
wants—the unlikely occurrence that two people each have a good or service that 
the other wants.
The existence of money makes trade easier. The restaurateur does not care 
whether you can produce a valuable good or service for him. He is happy to 
accept your money, knowing that other people will do the same for him. Such a 
convention allows trade to be roundabout. The restaurateur accepts your money 
and uses it to pay his chef; the chef uses her paycheck to send her child to day 
care; the day care center uses this tuition to pay a teacher; and the teacher hires 
you to mow his lawn. As money flows from person to person in the economy, 
it facilitates production and trade, thereby allowing each person to specialize in 
what he or she does best and raising everyone’s standard of living.
In this chapter, we begin to examine the role of money in the economy. We 
discuss what money is, the various forms that money takes, how the banking sys-
tem helps create money, and how the government controls the quantity of money 
in circulation. Because money is so important in the economy, we devote much 
effort in the rest of this book to learning how changes in the quantity of money 
affect various economic variables, including inflation, interest rates, production, 
and employment. Consistent with our long-run focus in the previous four chap-
ters, in the next chapter we examine the long-run effects of changes in the quantity 
of money. The short-run effects of monetary changes are a more complex topic, 
which we take up later in the book. This chapter provides the background for all 
of this further analysis.
The Meaning of Money
What is money? This might seem like an odd question. When you read that bil-
lionaire Bill Gates has a lot of money, you know what that means: He is so rich 
that he can buy almost anything he wants. In this sense, the term money is used 
to mean wealth.
Economists, however, use the word in a more specific sense: Money is the set 
of assets in the economy that people regularly use to buy goods and services from 
each other. The cash in your wallet is money because you can use it to buy a meal 
at a restaurant or a shirt at a clothing store. By contrast, if you happened to own 
a large share of Microsoft Corporation, as Bill Gates does, you would be wealthy, 
but this asset is not considered a form of money. You could not buy a meal or a 
shirt with this wealth without first obtaining some cash. According to the econo-
mist’s definition, money includes only those few types of wealth that are regularly 
accepted by sellers in exchange for goods and services.

The Functions of Money
Money has three functions in the economy: It is a medium of exchange, a unit of 
account, and a store of value. These three functions together distinguish money 
from other assets in the economy, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, art, and even 
baseball cards. Let’s examine each of these functions of money in turn.
A medium of exchange is an item that buyers give to sellers when they pur-
chase goods and services. When you buy a shirt at a clothing store, the store gives 
you the shirt, and you give the store your money. This transfer of money from 
buyer to seller allows the transaction to take place. When you walk into a store, 
you are confident that the store will accept your money for the items it is selling 
because money is the commonly accepted medium of exchange. 
A unit of account is the yardstick people use to post prices and record debts. 
When you go shopping, you might observe that a shirt costs $30 and a hamburger 
costs $3. Even though it would be accurate to say that the price of a shirt is 10 
hamburgers and the price of a hamburger is 1⁄10 of a shirt, prices are never quoted 
in this way. Similarly, if you take out a loan from a bank, the size of your future 
loan repayments will be measured in dollars, not in a quantity of goods and ser­
vices. When we want to measure and record economic value, we use money as 
the unit of account. 
A store of value is an item that people can use to transfer purchasing power 
from the present to the future. When a seller accepts money today in exchange for a 
good or service, that seller can hold the money and become a buyer of another good 
or service at another time. Money is not the only store of value in the economy: A 
person can also transfer purchasing power from the present to the future by hold-
ing nonmonetary assets such as stocks and bonds. The term wealth is used to refer 
to the total of all stores of value, including both money and nonmonetary assets.
Economists use the term liquidity to describe the ease with which an asset 
can be converted into the economy’s medium of exchange. Because money is the 
economy’s medium of exchange, it is the most liquid asset available. Other assets 
vary widely in their liquidity. Most stocks and bonds can be sold easily with small 
cost, so they are relatively liquid assets. By contrast, selling a house, a Rembrandt 
painting, or a 1948 Joe DiMaggio baseball card requires more time and effort, so 
these assets are less liquid.
When people decide in what form to hold their wealth, they have to balance the 
liquidity of each possible asset against the asset’s usefulness as a store of value. 
Money is the most liquid asset, but it is far from perfect as a store of value. When 
prices rise, the value of money falls. In other words, when goods and services 
become more expensive, each dollar in your wallet can buy less. This link between 
the price level and the value of money is key to understanding how money affects 
the economy, a topic we start to explore in the next chapter.
The Kinds of Money
When money takes the form of a commodity with intrinsic value, it is called 
commodity money. The term intrinsic value means that the item would have value 
even if it were not used as money. One example of commodity money is gold. 
Gold has intrinsic value because it is used in industry and in the making of jew-
elry. Although today we no longer use gold as money, historically gold has been a 
common form of money because it is relatively easy to carry, measure, and verify 
for impurities. When an economy uses gold as money (or uses paper money that is 
convertible into gold on demand), it is said to be operating under a gold standard.

Another example of commodity money is cigarettes. In prisoner-of-war camps 
during World War II, prisoners traded goods and services with one another 
using cigarettes as the store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange. 
Similarly, as the Soviet Union was breaking up in the late 1980s, cigarettes started 
replacing the ruble as the preferred currency in Moscow. In both cases, even non-
smokers were happy to accept cigarettes in an exchange, knowing that they could 
use the cigarettes to buy other goods and services.
Money without intrinsic value is called fiat money. A fiat is an order or decree, 
and fiat money is established as money by government decree. For example, 
compare the paper dollars in your wallet (printed by the U.S. government) and 
the paper dollars from a game of Monopoly (printed by the Parker Brothers game 
company). Why can you use the first to pay your bill at a restaurant but not the 
second? The answer is that the U.S. government has decreed its dollars to be valid 
money. Each paper dollar in your wallet reads: “This note is legal tender for all 
debts, public and private.”
Although the government is central to establishing and regulating a system 
of fiat money (by prosecuting counterfeiters, for example), other factors are also 
required for the success of such a monetary system. To a large extent, the accept-
ance of fiat money depends as much on expectations and social convention as 
on government decree. The Soviet government in the 1980s never abandoned 
the ruble as the official currency. Yet the people of Moscow preferred to accept 
­cigarettes (or even American dollars) in exchange for goods and services because 
they were more confident that these alternative monies would be accepted by 
others in the future.

Packs of Fish Catch

W
hen Larry Levine helped prepare 
divorce papers for a client a few years 
ago, he got paid in mackerel. Once the case 
ended, he says, “I had a stack of macks.”
	
Mr. Levine and his client were prisoners 
in California’s Lompoc Federal Correctional 
Complex. Like other federal inmates around 
the country, they found a can of ­mackerel—
the “mack” in prison lingo—was the ­standard 
currency.
	
“It’s the coin of the realm,” says Mark 
Bailey, who paid Mr. Levine in fish. Mr. Bailey 
was serving a two-year tax-fraud sentence 
in connection with a chain of strip clubs he 
owned. Mr. Levine was serving a nine-year 
term for drug dealing. Mr. Levine says he 
used his macks to get his beard trimmed, his 
clothes pressed and his shoes shined by other 
prisoners. “A haircut is two macks,” he says, 
as an expected tip for inmates who work in 
the prison barber shop.
	
There’s been a mackerel economy in 
federal prisons since about 2004, former 
inmates and some prison consultants say. 
That’s when federal prisons prohibited 
smoking and, by default, the cigarette pack, 
which was the earlier gold standard.
	
Prisoners need a proxy for the dollar 
because they’re not allowed to possess 
cash. Money they get from prison jobs

according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons) 
or family members goes into commissary 
accounts that let them buy things such as 
food and toiletries. After the smokes disap-
peared, inmates turned to other items on 
the commissary menu to use as currency.
	
Books of stamps were one easy alterna-
tive. “It was like half a book for a piece of 
fruit,” says Tony Serra, a well-known San 
Francisco criminal-defense attorney who last 
year finished nine months in Lompoc on 
tax charges. Elsewhere in the West, prison-
ers use PowerBars or cans of tuna, says 
Ed Bales, a consultant who advises people 
who are headed to prison. But in much of 
the federal prison system, he says, mackerel 
has become the currency of choice.
	
Mackerel supplier Global Source Mar­
keting Inc. says demand from prisons has 
grown since 2004. In recent years, demand 
has switched from cans—which wardens 
don’t like because inmates can turn them into 
makeshift knives—to plastic-and-foil pouches 
of mackerel fillets, says Jon Linder, a vice 
president at supplier Power Commissary Inc., 
in Bohemia, N.Y.
	
Mackerel is hot in prisons in the U.S., 
but not so much anywhere else, says Mark 
Muntz, president of Global Source, which 
imports fillets of the oily, dark-fleshed fish 
from Asian canneries. Mr. Muntz says he’s 
tried marketing mackerel to discount retail-
ers. “We’ve even tried 99-cent stores,” he 
says. “It never has done very well at all, 
regardless of the retailer, but it’s very popu-
lar in the prisons.”
	
Mr. Muntz says he sold more than 
$1  million of mackerel for federal prison 
commissaries last year. It accounted for 
about half his commissary sales, he says, 
outstripping the canned tuna, crab, chicken 
and oysters he offers.
	
Unlike those more expensive delicacies, 
former prisoners say, the mack is a good 
stand-in for the greenback because each 
can (or pouch) costs about $1 and few—
other than weight-lifters craving protein—
want to eat it.
	
So inmates stash macks in lockers provided 
by the prison and use them to buy goods, 
including illicit ones such as stolen food and 
home-brewed “prison hooch,” as well as ser-
vices, such as shoeshines and cell cleaning. 
“When I grow up, I am going to
be a medium of exchange, unit of
account, and store of value.”

Money in the U.S. Economy
As we will see, the quantity of money circulating in the economy, called the money 
stock, has a powerful influence on many economic variables. But before we con-
sider why that is true, we need to ask a preliminary question: What is the quantity 
of money? In particular, suppose you were given the task of measuring how much 
money there is in the U.S. economy. What would you include in your measure?
The most obvious asset to include is currency—the paper bills and coins in 
the hands of the public. Currency is clearly the most widely accepted medium 
of exchange in our economy. There is no doubt that it is part of the money stock.
Yet currency is not the only asset that you can use to buy goods and services. 
Many stores also accept personal checks. Wealth held in your checking account is 
almost as convenient for buying things as wealth held in your wallet. To ­measure 
the money stock, therefore, you might want to include demand deposits—­
balances in bank accounts that depositors can access on demand simply by writ-
ing a check or swiping a debit card at a store.
Once you start to consider balances in checking accounts as part of the money 
stock, you are led to consider the large variety of other accounts that people hold 
at banks and other financial institutions. Bank depositors usually cannot write 
checks against the balances in their savings accounts, but they can easily transfer 
funds from savings into checking accounts. In addition, depositors in money mar-
ket mutual funds can often write checks against their balances. Thus, these other 
accounts should plausibly be part of the U.S. money stock.

In a complex economy such as ours, it is not easy to draw a line between assets 
that can be called “money” and assets that cannot. The coins in your pocket 
clearly are part of the money stock, and the Empire State Building clearly is not, 
but there are many assets in between these extremes for which the choice is less 
clear. Because different analysts can reasonably disagree about where to draw the 
dividing line between monetary and nonmonetary assets, various measures of 
the money stock are available for the U.S. economy. Figure 1 shows the two most 
commonly used, designated M1 and M2. M2 includes more assets in its measure 
of money than does M1.
For our purposes in this book, we need not dwell on the differences between 
the various measures of money. None of our discussion will hinge on the distinc-
tion between M1 and M2. The important point is that the money stock for the U.S. 
economy includes not just currency but also deposits in banks and other financial 
institutions that can be readily accessed and used to buy goods and services.
Where Is All the Currency?
One puzzle about the money stock of the U.S. economy concerns the amount of 
currency. At the end of 2009, there was $862 billion of currency outstanding. To 
put this number in perspective, we can divide it by 236 million, the number of 
FYI
 Why Credit Cards Aren’t Money
I
t might seem natural to include credit cards as part of the econ-
omy’s stock of money. After all, people use credit cards to make 
many of their purchases. Aren’t credit cards, therefore, a medium 
of exchange?
	
At first this argument may seem persuasive, but credit cards are 
excluded from all measures of the quantity of money. The reason is 
that credit cards are not really a method of payment but a method 
of deferring payment. When you buy a meal with a credit card, the 
bank that issued the card pays the restaurant what it is due. At a 
later date, you will have to repay the bank (perhaps with interest). 
When the time comes to pay your credit card bill, you will probably 
do so by writing a check against your checking account. The balance 
in this checking account is part of the economy’s stock of money.
	
Notice that credit cards are very different from debit cards, 
which automatically withdraw funds from a bank account to pay 
for items bought. Rather than allowing the user to postpone pay-
ment for a purchase, a debit card allows the user immediate access 
to deposits in a bank account. In this sense, a debit card is more 
similar to a check than to a credit card. The account balances that 
lie behind debit cards are included in measures of the quantity of 
money.
	
Even though credit cards are not considered a form of money, 
they are nonetheless important for analyzing the monetary sys-
tem. People who have credit cards can pay many of their bills 
together at the end of the month, rather than sporadically as they 
make purchases. As a result, people who have credit cards prob-
ably hold less money on average than people who do not have 
credit cards. Thus, the introduction and increased popularity of 
credit cards may reduce the amount of money that people choose 
to hold.

adults (age 16 and older) in the United States. This calculation implies that the 
average adult holds about $3,653 of currency. Most people are surprised to learn 
that our economy has so much currency because they carry far less than this in 
their wallets. 
	
Who is holding all this currency? No one knows for sure, but there are two 
plausible explanations. 
	
The first explanation is that much of the currency is held abroad. In foreign 
countries without a stable monetary system, people often prefer U.S. dollars to 
domestic assets. It is, in fact, not unusual to see U.S. dollars used overseas as the 
medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value.
	
The second explanation is that much of the currency is held by drug dealers, tax 
evaders, and other criminals. For most people in the U.S. economy, currency is not 
a particularly good way to hold wealth. Not only can currency be lost or stolen, 
but it also does not earn interest, whereas a bank deposit does. Thus, most people 
hold only small amounts of currency. By contrast, criminals may avoid putting their 
wealth in banks because a bank deposit gives police a paper trail they can use to trace 
illegal activities. For criminals, currency may be the best store of value available.  ■
Quick Quiz  List and describe the three functions of money.
The Federal Reserve System
Whenever an economy uses a system of fiat money, as the U.S. economy does, 
some agency must be responsible for regulating the system. In the United States, 
that agency is the Federal Reserve, often simply called the Fed. If you look at the 
top of a dollar bill, you will see that it is called a “Federal Reserve Note.” The Fed 
is an example of a central bank—an institution designed to oversee the banking 
system and regulate the quantity of money in the economy. Other major central 
banks around the world include the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the 
European Central Bank.

The Fed’s Organization
The Federal Reserve was created in 1913 after a series of bank failures in 1907 
convinced Congress that the United States needed a central bank to ensure the 
health of the nation’s banking system. Today, the Fed is run by its board of gover-
nors, which has seven members appointed by the president and confirmed by the 
Senate. The governors have fourteen-year terms. Just as federal judges are given 
lifetime appointments to insulate them from politics, Fed governors are given long 
terms to give them independence from short-term political pressures when they 
formulate monetary policy.
Among the seven members of the board of governors, the most important is 
the chairman. The chairman directs the Fed staff, presides over board meetings, 
and testifies regularly about Fed policy in front of congressional committees. The 
president appoints the chairman to a four-year term. As this book was going to 
press, the chairman of the Fed was Ben Bernanke, a former economics professor 
who was appointed to the Fed job by President George W. Bush in 2005 and reap-
pointed by President Barack Obama in 2009.
The Federal Reserve System is made up of the Federal Reserve Board in 
Washington, D.C., and twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks located in major 
cities around the country. The presidents of the regional banks are chosen by each 
bank’s board of directors, whose members are typically drawn from the region’s 
banking and business community. 
The Fed has two related jobs. The first is to regulate banks and ensure the 
health of the banking system. This task is largely the responsibility of the regional 
Federal Reserve Banks. In particular, the Fed monitors each bank’s financial con-
dition and facilitates bank transactions by clearing checks. It also acts as a bank’s 
bank. That is, the Fed makes loans to banks when banks themselves want to bor-
row. When financially troubled banks find themselves short of cash, the Fed acts 
as a lender of last resort—a lender to those who cannot borrow anywhere else—to 
maintain stability in the overall banking system. 
The Fed’s second and more important job is to control the quantity of money 
that is made available in the economy, called the money supply. Decisions by 
policymakers concerning the money supply constitute monetary policy. At the 
Federal Reserve, monetary policy is made by the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC). The FOMC meets about every six weeks in Washington, D.C., to discuss 
the condition of the economy and consider changes in monetary policy.
The Federal Open Market Committee
The Federal Open Market Committee is made up of the seven members of 
the board of governors and five of the twelve regional bank presidents. All 
twelve regional presidents attend each FOMC meeting, but only five get to 
vote. The five with voting rights rotate among the twelve regional presidents 
over time. The president of the New York Fed always gets a vote, however, 
because New York is the traditional financial center of the U.S. economy and 
because all Fed purchases and sales of government bonds are conducted at the 
New York Fed’s trading desk.
Through the decisions of the FOMC, the Fed has the power to increase or 
decrease the number of dollars in the economy. In simple metaphorical terms, 
you can imagine the Fed printing dollar bills and dropping them around the 
country by helicopter. Similarly, you can imagine the Fed using a giant vacuum 
cleaner to suck dollar bills out of people’s wallets. Although in practice the Fed’s

methods for changing the money supply are more complex and subtle than this, 
the helicopter-vacuum metaphor is a good first step to understanding the mean-
ing of monetary policy.
Later in this chapter, we discuss how the Fed actually changes the money 
supply, but it is worth noting here that the Fed’s primary tool is the open-market 
operation—the purchase and sale of U.S. government bonds. (Recall that a U.S. 
government bond is a certificate of indebtedness of the federal government.) If 
the FOMC decides to increase the money supply, the Fed creates dollars and uses 
them to buy government bonds from the public in the nation’s bond markets. 
After the purchase, these dollars are in the hands of the public. Thus, an open-
market purchase of bonds by the Fed increases the money supply. Conversely, if 
the FOMC decides to decrease the money supply, the Fed sells government bonds 
from its portfolio to the public in the nation’s bond markets. After the sale, the 
dollars it receives for the bonds are out of the hands of the public. Thus, an open-
market sale of bonds by the Fed decreases the money supply.
Central banks are important institutions because changes in the money sup-
ply can profoundly affect the economy. One of the Ten Principles of Economics 
in Chapter 1 is that prices rise when the government prints too much money. 
Another of the Ten Principles of Economics is that society faces a short-run trade-off 
between inflation and unemployment. The power of the Fed rests on these prin-
ciples. For reasons we discuss more fully in the coming chapters, the Fed’s policy 
decisions have an important influence on the economy’s rate of inflation in the 
long run and the economy’s employment and production in the short run. Indeed, 
the chairman of the Federal Reserve has been called the second most powerful 
person in the United States. 
Quick Quiz  What are the primary responsibilities of the Federal Reserve? If the Fed 
wants to increase the supply of money, how does it usually do so?
Banks and the Money Supply
So far, we have introduced the concept of “money” and discussed how the 
Federal Reserve controls the supply of money by buying and selling government 
bonds in open‑market operations. Although this explanation of the money supply 
is correct, it is not complete. In particular, it omits the central role that banks play 
in the monetary system. 
Recall that the amount of money you hold includes both currency (the bills in 
your wallet and coins in your pocket) and demand deposits (the balance in your 
checking account). Because demand deposits are held in banks, the behavior of 
banks can influence the quantity of demand deposits in the economy and, therefore, 
the money supply. This section examines how banks affect the money supply and, 
in doing so, how they complicate the Fed’s job of controlling the money supply.
The Simple Case of 100‑Percent‑Reserve Banking
To see how banks influence the money supply, let’s first imagine a world without 
any banks at all. In this simple world, currency is the only form of money. To be 
concrete, let’s suppose that the total quantity of currency is $100. The supply of 
money is, therefore, $100.

Now suppose that someone opens a bank, appropriately called First National 
Bank. First National Bank is only a depository institution—that is, it accepts 
deposits but does not make loans. The purpose of the bank is to give depositors 
a safe place to keep their money. Whenever a person deposits some money, the 
bank keeps the money in its vault until the depositor withdraws it, writes a 
check, or uses a debit card to access his or her balance. Deposits that banks have 
received but have not loaned out are called reserves. In this imaginary econ-
omy, all deposits are held as reserves, so this system is called 100‑percent‑reserve 
banking. 
We can express the financial position of First National Bank with a T-account, 
which is a simplified accounting statement that shows changes in a bank’s assets 
and liabilities. Here is the T-account for First National Bank if the economy’s 
entire $100 of money is deposited in the bank: 
First National Bank
Assets
Liabilities
Reserves
$100.00
Deposits
$100.00
On the left side of the T-account are the bank’s assets of $100 (the reserves it holds 
in its vaults). On the right side are the bank’s liabilities of $100 (the amount it owes 
to its depositors). Because the assets and liabilities of First National Bank exactly 
balance, this accounting statement is sometimes called a balance sheet. 
Now consider the money supply in this imaginary economy. Before First 
National Bank opens, the money supply is the $100 of currency that people are 
holding. After the bank opens and people deposit their currency, the money sup-
ply is the $100 of demand deposits. (There is no longer any currency outstand-
ing, for it is all in the bank vault.) Each deposit in the bank reduces currency and 
raises demand deposits by exactly the same amount, leaving the money supply 
unchanged. Thus, if banks hold all deposits in reserve, banks do not influence the supply 
of money.
Money Creation with Fractional‑Reserve Banking
Eventually, the bankers at First National Bank may start to reconsider their policy 
of 100-percent-reserve banking. Leaving all that money idle in their vaults seems 
unnecessary. Why not lend some of it out and earn a profit by charging interest 
on the loans? Families buying houses, firms building new factories, and students 
paying for college would all be happy to pay interest to borrow some of that 
money for a while. First National Bank has to keep some reserves so that cur-
rency is available if depositors want to make withdrawals. But if the flow of new 
deposits is roughly the same as the flow of withdrawals, First National needs to 
keep only a fraction of its deposits in reserve. Thus, First National adopts a system 
called fractional‑reserve banking.
The fraction of total deposits that a bank holds as reserves is called the reserve 
ratio. This ratio is determined by a combination of government regulation and 
bank policy. As we discuss more fully later in the chapter, the Fed sets a minimum 
amount of reserves that banks must hold, called a reserve requirement. In addition, 
banks may hold reserves above the legal minimum, called excess reserves, so they 
can be more confident that they will not run short of cash. For our purpose here, 
we take the reserve ratio as given to examine how fractional-reserve banking 
influences the money supply.

Let’s suppose that First National has a reserve ratio of 1/10, or 10 percent. This 
means that it keeps 10 percent of its deposits in reserve and loans out the rest. 
Now let’s look again at the bank’s T-account:
First National Bank
Assets
Liabilities
Reserves
$10.00
Deposits
$100.00
Loans
  90.00
First National still has $100 in liabilities because making the loans did not alter the 
bank’s obligation to its depositors. But now the bank has two kinds of assets: It has 
$10 of reserves in its vault, and it has loans of $90. (These loans are liabilities of 
the people taking out the loans, but they are assets of the bank making the loans 
because the borrowers will later repay the bank.) In total, First National’s assets 
still equal its liabilities.
Once again consider the supply of money in the economy. Before First 
National makes any loans, the money supply is the $100 of deposits in the bank. 
Yet when First National makes these loans, the money supply increases. The 
depositors still have demand deposits totaling $100, but now the borrowers 
hold $90 in currency. The money supply (which equals currency plus demand 
deposits) equals $190. Thus, when banks hold only a fraction of deposits in reserve, 
banks create money.
At first, this creation of money by fractional-reserve banking may seem too good 
to be true: It appears that the bank has created money out of thin air. To make this 
creation of money seem less miraculous, note that when First National Bank loans 
out some of its reserves and creates money, it does not create any wealth. Loans from 
First National give the borrowers some currency and thus the ability to buy goods 
and services. Yet the borrowers are also taking on debts, so the loans do not make 
them any richer. In other words, as a bank creates the asset of money, it also creates 
a corresponding liability for those who borrowed the created money. At the end of 
this process of money creation, the economy is more liquid in the sense that there 
is more of the medium of exchange, but the economy is no wealthier than before.
The Money Multiplier 
The creation of money does not stop with First National Bank. Suppose the bor-
rower from First National uses the $90 to buy something from someone who then 
deposits the currency in Second National Bank. Here is the T-account for Second 
National Bank:
Second National Bank
Assets
Liabilities
Reserves
$  9.00
Deposits
$90.00
Loans
81.00
After the deposit, this bank has liabilities of $90. If Second National also has a 
reserve ratio of 10 percent, it keeps assets of $9 in reserve and makes $81 in loans. 
In this way, Second National Bank creates an additional $81 of money. If this $81

T-account for Third National Bank:

The process goes on and on. Each time that money is deposited and a bank loan 
is made, more money is created.
How much money is eventually created in this economy? Let’s add it up:

Total money supply

It turns out that even though this process of money creation can continue forever, 
it does not create an infinite amount of money. If you laboriously add the infinite 
sequence of numbers in the preceding example, you find the $100 of reserves 
generates $1,000 of money. The amount of money the banking system generates 
with each dollar of reserves is called the money multiplier. In this imaginary 
economy, where the $100 of reserves generates $1,000 of money, the money 
multiplier is 10.
What determines the size of the money multiplier? It turns out that the 
answer is simple: The money multiplier is the reciprocal of the reserve ratio. If R 
is the reserve ratio for all banks in the economy, then each dollar of reserves 
generates 1/R dollars of money. In our example, R = 1/10, so the money mul-
tiplier is 10.
This reciprocal formula for the money multiplier makes sense. If a bank holds 
$1,000 in deposits, then a reserve ratio of 1/10 (10 percent) means that the bank 
must hold $100 in reserves. The money multiplier just turns this idea around: If 
the banking system as a whole holds a total of $100 in reserves, it can have only 
$1,000 in deposits. In other words, if R is the ratio of reserves to deposits at each 
bank (that is, the reserve ratio), then the ratio of deposits to reserves in the bank-
ing system (that is, the money multiplier) must be 1/R.
This formula shows how the amount of money banks create depends on the 
reserve ratio. If the reserve ratio were only 1/20 (5 percent), then the banking sys-
tem would have 20 times as much in deposits as in reserves, implying a money 
multiplier of 20. Each dollar of reserves would generate $20 of money. Similarly, 
if the reserve ratio were 1/4 (25 percent), deposits would be 4 times reserves, the 
money multiplier would be 4, and each dollar of reserves would generate $4 of 
money. Thus, the higher the reserve ratio, the less of each deposit banks loan out, and 
the smaller the money multiplier. In the special case of 100-percent-reserve banking,

banking system generates

create money.
Bank Capital, Leverage, and the Financial  
Crisis of 2008–2009
In the previous sections, we have seen a very simplified explanation of how banks 
work. The reality of modern banking, however, is a bit more complicated, and this 
complex reality played a leading role in the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. Before 
looking at that crisis, we need to learn a bit more about how banks actually function.
In the bank balance sheets you have seen so far, a bank accepts deposits and 
uses those deposits either to make loans or to hold reserves. More realistically, a 
bank gets financial resources not only from accepting deposits but also, like other 
companies, from issuing equity and debt. The resources that a bank obtains from 
issuing equity to its owners are called bank capital. A bank uses these financial 
resources in various ways to generate profit for its owners. It not only makes loans 
and holds reserves but also buys financial securities, such as stocks and bonds. 
Here is a more realistic example of a bank’s balance sheet:
More Realistic National Bank
Assets
Liabilities and Owners’ Equity
Reserves
$200
Deposits
$800
Loans
700
Debt
150
Securities
100
Capital (owners’ equity)
  50
On the right side of this balance sheet are the bank’s liabilities and capital (also 
known as owners’ equity). This bank obtained $50 of resources from its owners. It 
also took in $800 of deposits and issued $150 of debt. The total of $1,000 was put 
to use in three ways; these are listed on the left side of the balance sheet, which 
shows the bank’s assets. This bank held $200 in reserves, made $700 in bank loans, 
and used $100 to buy financial securities, such as government or corporate bonds. 
The bank decides how to allocate its resources among asset classes based on their 
risk and return, as well as on any regulations (such as reserve requirements) that 
restrict the bank’s choices. 
By the rules of accounting, the reserves, loans, and securities on the left side 
of the balance sheet must always equal, in total, the deposits, debt, and capital 
on the right side of the balance sheet. There is no magic in this equality. It occurs 
because the value of the owners’ equity is, by definition, the value of the bank’s 
assets (reserves, loans, and securities) minus the value of its liabilities (deposits 
and debt). Therefore, the left and right hand sides of the balance sheet always sum 
to the same total.
Many businesses in the economy rely on leverage, the use of borrowed money 
to supplement existing funds for investment purposes. Indeed, whenever anyone 
uses debt to finance an investment project, he is applying leverage. Leverage is 
particularly important for banks, however, because borrowing and lending are at 
the heart of what they do. To fully understand banking, therefore, it is crucial to 
understand how leverage works. 
The leverage ratio is the ratio of the bank’s total assets to bank capital. In this 
example, the leverage ratio is $1,000/$50, or 20. A leverage ratio of 20 means that

for every dollar of capital that the bank owners have contributed, the bank has $20 
of assets. Of the $20 of assets, $19 are financed with borrowed money—either by 
taking in deposits or issuing debt.
You may have learned in a science class that a lever can amplify a force: A boul-
der that you cannot move with your arms alone will move more easily if you use 
a lever. A similar result occurs with bank leverage. To see how this works, let’s 
continue with this numerical example. Suppose that the bank’s assets were to rise 
in value by 5 percent because, say, some of the securities the bank was holding 
rose in price. Then the $1,000 of assets would now be worth $1,050. Because the 
depositors and debt holders are still owed $950, the bank capital rises from $50 to 
$100. Thus, when the leverage rate is 20, a 5-percent increase in the value of assets 
increases the owners’ equity by 100 percent.
The same principle works on the downside, but with troubling consequences. 
Suppose that some people who borrowed from the bank default on their loans, 
reducing the value of the bank’s assets by 5 percent, to $950. Because the deposi-
tors and debt holders have the legal right to be paid before the bank owners, the 
value of the owners’ equity falls to zero. Thus, when the leverage ratio is 20, a 
5-percent fall in the value of the bank assets leads to a 100-percent fall in bank 
capital. If the value of assets were to fall by more than 5 percent, the bank’s assets 
would fall below its liabilities. In this case, the bank would be insolvent, and it 
would be unable to pay off its debt holders and depositors in full.
Bank regulators require banks to hold a certain amount of capital. The goal of 
such a capital requirement is to ensure that banks will be able to pay off their 
depositors (without having to resort to government-provided deposit insurance 
funds). The amount of capital required depends on the kind of assets a bank 
holds. If the bank holds safe assets such as government bonds, regulators require 
less capital than if the bank holds risky assets such as loans to borrowers whose 
credit is of dubious quality.
In 2008 and 2009, many banks found themselves with too little capital after 
they had incurred losses on some of their assets—specifically, mortgage loans 
and securities backed by mortgage loans. The shortage of capital induced the 
banks to reduce their lending, a phenomenon sometimes called a credit crunch, 
which in turn contributed to a severe downturn in economic activity. (This event 
is discussed more fully in Chapter     .) To address this problem, the U.S. Treasury, 
working together with the Federal Reserve, put many billions of dollars of public 
funds into the banking system to increase the amount of bank capital. As a result, 
it temporarily made the U.S. taxpayer a part owner of many banks. The goal of 
this unusual policy was to recapitalize the banking system so that bank lending 
could return to a more normal level, which in fact occurred by late 2009.
The Fed’s Tools of Monetary Control
As we have already discussed, the Federal Reserve is responsible for controlling 
the supply of money in the economy. Now that we understand how banking 
works, we are in a better position to understand how the Fed carries out this job. 
Because banks create money in a system of fractional-reserve banking, the Fed’s 
control of the money supply is indirect. When the Fed decides to change the 
money supply, it must consider how its actions will work through the banking 
system.

The Fed has a variety of tools in its monetary toolbox. We can group those tools 
into two groups: those that influence the quantity of reserves and those that influ-
ence the reserve ratio and thereby the money multiplier.
How the Fed Influences the Quantity of Reserves
The first way the Fed can change the money supply is by changing the quantity of 
reserves. The Fed alters the quantity of reserves in the economy either by buying 
or selling bonds in open-market operations or by making loans to banks (or by 
some combination of the two). Let’s consider each of these in turn.
Open-Market Operations  As we noted earlier, the Fed conducts open‑market 
operations when it buys or sells government bonds. To increase the money sup-
ply, the Fed instructs its bond traders at the New York Fed to buy bonds from 
the public in the nation’s bond markets. The dollars the Fed pays for the bonds 
increase the number of dollars in the economy. Some of these new dollars are held 
as currency, and some are deposited in banks. Each new dollar held as currency 
increases the money supply by exactly $1. Each new dollar deposited in a bank 
increases the money supply by more than a dollar because it increases reserves 
and, thereby, the amount of money that the banking system can create.
To reduce the money supply, the Fed does just the opposite: It sells government 
bonds to the public in the nation’s bond markets. The public pays for these bonds 
with its holdings of currency and bank deposits, directly reducing the amount 
of money in circulation. In addition, as people make withdrawals from banks to 
buy these bonds from the Fed, banks find themselves with a smaller quantity of 
reserves. In response, banks reduce the amount of lending, and the process of 
money creation reverses itself.
Open-market operations are easy to conduct. In fact, the Fed’s purchases and 
sales of government bonds in the nation’s bond markets are similar to the trans-
actions that any individual might undertake for his own portfolio. (Of course, 
when an individual buys or sells a bond, money changes hands, but the amount 
of money in circulation remains the same.) In addition, the Fed can use open-
market operations to change the money supply by a small or large amount on 
any day without major changes in laws or bank regulations. Therefore, open-
market operations are the tool of monetary policy that the Fed uses most often. 
Fed Lending to Banks  The Fed can also increase the quantity of reserves 
in the economy by lending reserves to banks. Banks borrow from the Fed when 
they feel they do not have enough reserves on hand, either to satisfy bank 
regulators, meet depositor withdrawals, make new loans, or for some other 
business reason. 
There are various ways banks can borrow from the Fed. Traditionally, banks 
borrow from the Fed’s discount window and pay an interest rate on that loan called 
the discount rate. When the Fed makes such a loan to a bank, the banking system 
has more reserves than it otherwise would, and these additional reserves allow 
the banking system to create more money.
The Fed can alter the money supply by changing the discount rate. A higher 
discount rate discourages banks from borrowing reserves from the Fed. Thus, an 
increase in the discount rate reduces the quantity of reserves in the banking sys-
tem, which in turn reduces the money supply. Conversely, a lower discount rate 
encourages banks to borrow from the Fed, increasing the quantity of reserves and 
the money supply.

## Page 634

In recent years, the Federal Reserve has set up new mechanisms for banks 
to borrow from the Fed. For example, under the Term Auction Facility, the Fed 
sets a quantity of funds it wants to lend to banks, and eligible banks then bid to 
borrow those funds. The loans go to the highest eligible bidders—that is, to the 
banks that have acceptable collateral and are offering to pay the highest interest 
rate. Unlike at the discount window, where the Fed sets the price of a loan and 
the banks determine the quantity of borrowing, at the Term Auction Facility 
the Fed sets the quantity of borrowing and competitive bidding among banks 
determines the price. The more funds the Fed makes available through this and 
similar facilities, the greater the quantity of reserves and the larger the money 
supply.
The Fed uses such lending not only to control the money supply but also to 
help financial institutions when they are in trouble. For example, when the stock 
market crashed by 22 percent on October 19, 1987, many Wall Street brokerage 
firms found themselves temporarily in need of funds to finance the high vol-
ume of stock trading. The next morning, before the stock market opened, Fed 
Chairman Alan Greenspan announced the Fed’s “readiness to serve as a source of 
liquidity to support the economic and financial system.” Many economists believe 
that Greenspan’s reaction to the stock crash was an important reason it had few 
repercussions.
Similarly, in 2008 and 2009, a fall in housing prices throughout the United 
States led to a sharp rise in the number of homeowners defaulting on their mort-
gage loans, and many financial institutions holding those mortgages ran into 
trouble. In an attempt to prevent these events from having broader economic 
ramifications, the Fed provided many billions of dollars of loans to financial insti-
tutions in distress.
How the Fed Influences the Reserve Ratio
In addition to influencing the quantity of reserves, the Fed changes the money 
supply by influencing the reserve ratio and thereby the money multiplier. 
The Fed can influence the reserve ratio either through regulating the quantity 
of reserves banks must hold or through the interest rate that the Fed pays 
banks on their reserves. Again, we consider each of these monetary policy tools 
in turn.
Reserve Requirements  One way the Fed can influence the reserve ratio is by 
altering reserve requirements, the regulations that set the minimum amount of 
reserves that banks must hold against their deposits. Reserve requirements influ-
ence how much money the banking system can create with each dollar of reserves. 
An increase in reserve requirements means that banks must hold more reserves 
and, therefore, can loan out less of each dollar that is deposited. As a result, 
an increase in reserve requirements raises the reserve ratio, lowers the money 
multiplier, and decreases the money supply. Conversely, a decrease in reserve 
requirements lowers the reserve ratio, raises the money multiplier, and increases 
the money supply.
The Fed uses changes in reserve requirements only rarely because these 
changes disrupt the business of banking. When the Fed increases reserve 
requirements, for instance, some banks find themselves short of reserves, 
even though they have seen no change in deposits. As a result, they have to

curtail lending until they build their level of reserves to the new required 
level. Moreover, in recent years, this particular tool has become less effec-
tive because many banks hold excess reserves (that is, more reserves than are 
required).
Paying Interest on Reserves  Traditionally, banks did not earn any interest 
on the reserves they held. In October 2008, however, the Fed began paying inter-
est on reserves. That is, when a bank holds reserves on deposit at the Fed, the Fed 
now pays the bank interest on those deposits. This change gives the Fed another 
tool with which to influence the economy. The higher the interest rate on reserves, 
the more reserves banks will choose to hold. Thus, an increase in the interest rate 
on reserves will tend to increase the reserve ratio, lower the money multiplier, 
and lower the money supply. Because the Fed has paid interest on reserves for a 
relatively short time, it is not yet clear how important this new instrument will be 
in the conduct of monetary policy.
Problems in Controlling the Money Supply
The Fed’s various tools—open-market operations, bank lending, reserve require-
ments, and interest on reserves—have powerful effects on the money supply. Yet 
the Fed’s control of the money supply is not precise. The Fed must wrestle with 
two problems, each of which arises because much of the money supply is created 
by our system of fractional-reserve banking. 
The first problem is that the Fed does not control the amount of money that 
households choose to hold as deposits in banks. The more money households 
deposit, the more reserves banks have, and the more money the banking system 
can create. The less money households deposit, the less reserves banks have, and 
the less money the banking system can create. To see why this is a problem, sup-
pose that one day people begin to lose confidence in the banking system and, 
therefore, decide to withdraw deposits and hold more currency. When this hap-
pens, the banking system loses reserves and creates less money. The money sup-
ply falls, even without any Fed action.
The second problem of monetary control is that the Fed does not control 
the amount that bankers choose to lend. When money is deposited in a bank, 
it creates more money only when the bank loans it out. Because banks can 
choose to hold excess reserves instead, the Fed cannot be sure how much 
money the banking system will create. For instance, suppose that one day 
bankers become more cautious about economic conditions and decide to make 
fewer loans and hold greater reserves. In this case, the banking system cre-
ates less money than it otherwise would. Because of the bankers’ decision, the 
money supply falls.
Hence, in a system of fractional-reserve banking, the amount of money in the 
economy depends in part on the behavior of depositors and bankers. Because the 
Fed cannot control or perfectly predict this behavior, it cannot perfectly control 
the money supply. Yet if the Fed is vigilant, these problems need not be large. 
The Fed collects data on deposits and reserves from banks every week, so it is 
quickly aware of any changes in depositor or banker behavior. It can, therefore, 
respond to these changes and keep the money supply close to whatever level it 
chooses.

Bank Runs and the Money Supply
Most likely you have never witnessed a bank run in real life, but you may have 
seen one depicted in movies such as Mary Poppins or It’s a Wonderful Life. A bank 
run occurs when depositors suspect that a bank may go bankrupt and, therefore, 
“run” to the bank to withdraw their deposits. The United States has not seen 
a major bank run in recent history, but in the United Kingdom, a bank called 
Northern Rock experienced a run in 2007 and, as a result, was eventually taken 
over by the government.
	
Bank runs are a problem for banks under fractional-reserve banking. Because a 
bank holds only a fraction of its deposits in reserve, it cannot satisfy withdrawal 
requests from all depositors. Even if the bank is in fact solvent (meaning that its 
assets exceed its liabilities), it will not have enough cash on hand to allow all 
depositors immediate access to all of their money. When a run occurs, the bank 
is forced to close its doors until some bank loans are repaid or until some lender 
of last resort (such as the Fed) provides it with the currency it needs to satisfy 
depositors.
	
Bank runs complicate the control of the money supply. An important exam-
ple of this problem occurred during the Great Depression in the early 1930s. 
After a wave of bank runs and bank closings, households and bankers became 
more cautious. Households withdrew their deposits from banks, preferring to 
hold their money in the form of currency. This decision reversed the process 
of money creation, as bankers responded to falling reserves by reducing bank 
loans. At the same time, bankers increased their reserve ratios so that they 
would have enough cash on hand to meet their depositors’ demands in any 
future bank runs. The higher reserve ratio reduced the money multiplier, which 
further reduced the money supply. From 1929 to 1933, the money supply fell 
by 28 percent, without the Federal Reserve taking any deliberate contraction-
ary action. Many economists point to this massive fall in the money supply to 
explain the high unemployment and falling prices that prevailed during this 
period. (In future chapters, we examine the mechanisms by which changes in 
the money supply affect unemployment and prices.)
	
Today, bank runs are not a major problem for the U.S. banking system or the 
Fed. The federal government now guarantees the safety of deposits at most banks, 
primarily through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Depositors 
do not run on their banks because they are confident that, even if their bank goes 
bankrupt, the FDIC will make good on the deposits. The policy of government 
deposit insurance has costs: Bankers whose deposits are guaranteed may have too 
little incentive to avoid bad risks when making loans. But one benefit of deposit 
insurance is a more stable banking system. As a result, most people see bank runs 
only in the movies.  ■
The Federal Funds Rate
If you read about U.S. monetary policy in the newspaper, you will find much 
discussion of the federal funds rate. This raises several questions:
Q:  What is the federal funds rate?
A:  The federal funds rate is the short-term interest rate that banks charge one 
another for loans. If one bank finds itself short of reserves while another 
federal funds rate
the interest rate at which 
banks make overnight 
loans to one another

bank has excess reserves, the second bank can lend some reserves to the 
first. The loans are temporary—typically overnight. The price of the loan is 
the federal funds rate.
Q:  How is the federal funds rate different from the discount rate?
A:  The discount rate is the interest rate banks pay to borrow directly from the 
Federal Reserve through the discount window. Borrowing reserves from 
another bank in the federal funds market is an alternative to borrowing 
reserves from the Fed, and a bank short of reserves will typically do which-
ever is cheaper. In practice, the discount rate and the federal funds rate 
move closely together.
Q:  Does the federal funds rate matter only for banks?
A:  Not at all. While only banks borrow directly in the federal funds market, 
the economic impact of this market is much broader. Because different  
parts of the financial system are highly interconnected, interest rates on 
different kinds of loans are strongly correlated with one another. So when 
the federal funds rate rises or falls, other interest rates often move in the 
same direction.
Q:  What does the Federal Reserve have to do with the federal funds rate?
A:  In recent years, the Federal Reserve has set a target goal for the federal 
funds rate. When the Federal Open Market Committee meets approximately 
every six weeks, it decides whether to raise or lower that target. 
Q:  How can the Fed make the federal funds rate hit the target it sets?
A:  Although the actual federal funds rate is set by supply and demand in 
the market for loans among banks, the Fed can use open-market opera-
tions to influence that market. For example, when the Fed buys bonds in 
­open-market operations, it injects reserves into the banking system. With 
more reserves in the system, fewer banks find themselves in need of bor-
rowing reserves to meet reserve requirements. The fall in demand for bor-
rowing reserves decreases the price of such borrowing, which is the federal 
funds rate. Conversely, when the Fed sells bonds and withdraws reserves 
from the banking system, more banks find themselves short of reserves, 
and they bid up the price of borrowing reserves. Thus, open-market pur-
chases lower the federal funds rate, and open-market sales raise the federal 
funds rate.
Q:  But don’t these open-market operations affect the money supply?
A:  Yes, absolutely. When the Fed announces a change in the federal funds 
rate, it is committing itself to the open-market operations necessary to 
make that change happen, and these open-market operations will alter 
the supply of money. Decisions by the FOMC to change the target for the 
federal funds rate are also decisions to change the money supply. They are 
two sides of the same coin. Other things equal, a decrease in the target for 
the federal funds rate means an expansion in the money supply, and an 
increase in the target for the federal funds rate means a contraction in the 
money supply.
Quick Quiz  Describe how banks create money. • If the Fed wanted to use all three 
of its policy tools to decrease the money supply, what would it do?

Summary
Conclusion
Some years ago, a book made the best-seller list with the title Secrets of the 
Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country. Although no doubt an exag-
geration, this title did highlight the important role of the monetary system 
in our daily lives. Whenever we buy or sell anything, we are relying on the 
extraordinarily useful social convention called “money.” Now that we know 
what money is and what determines its supply, we can discuss how changes 
in the quantity of money affect the economy. We begin to address that topic in 
the next chapter.
• The term money refers to assets that people regu-
larly use to buy goods and services.
• Money serves three functions. As a medium 
of exchange, it provides the item used to make 
transactions. As a unit of account, it provides the 
way in which prices and other economic values 
are recorded. As a store of value, it provides a 
way of transferring purchasing power from the 
present to the future.
• Commodity money, such as gold, is money that 
has intrinsic value: It would be valued even if 
it were not used as money. Fiat money, such as 
paper dollars, is money without intrinsic value: It 
would be worthless if it were not used as money.
• In the U.S. economy, money takes the form of 
currency and various types of bank deposits, 
such as checking accounts. 
• The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the 
United States, is responsible for regulating the 
U.S. monetary system. The Fed chairman is 
appointed by the president and confirmed by 
Congress every four years. The chairman is 
the lead member of the Federal Open Market 
Committee, which meets about every six weeks 
to consider changes in monetary policy.
• Bank depositors provide resources to banks 
by depositing their funds into bank accounts. 
These deposits are part of a bank’s liabilities. 
Bank owners also provide resources (called 
bank capital) for the bank. Because of leverage 
(the use of borrowed funds for investment), a 
small change in the value of a bank’s assets can 
lead to a large change in the value of the bank’s 
capital. To protect depositors, bank regula-
tors require banks to hold a certain minimum 
amount of capital. 
• The Fed controls the money supply primarily 
through open-market operations: The purchase 
of government bonds increases the money sup-
ply, and the sale of government bonds decreases 
the money supply. The Fed also uses other tools 
to control the money supply. It can expand the 
money supply by decreasing the discount rate, 
increasing its lending to banks, lowering reserve 
requirements, or decreasing the interest rate on 
reserves. It can contract the money supply by 
increasing the discount rate, decreasing its lend-
ing to banks, raising reserve requirements, or 
increasing the interest rate on reserves.
• When individuals deposit money in banks and 
banks loan out some of these deposits, the quan-
tity of money in the economy increases. Because 
the banking system influences the money supply 
in this way, the Fed’s control of the money sup-
ply is imperfect.
• The Federal Reserve has in recent years set 
monetary policy by choosing a target for the 
federal funds rate, a short-term interest rate 
at which banks make loans to one another. As 
the Fed achieves its target, it adjusts the money 
supply.

of deposits, by how much does the total amount 
of deposits in the banking system increase? By 
how much does the money supply increase? 
	 5.	 Happy Bank starts with $200 in bank capital.  
It then takes in $800 in deposits. It keeps  
12.5 percent (1/8th) of deposits in reserve. It 
uses the rest of its assets to make bank loans.
a.	 Show the balance sheet of Happy Bank.
b.	What is Happy Bank’s leverage ratio?
c.	 Suppose that 10 percent of the borrowers 
from Happy Bank default and these bank 
loans become worthless. Show the bank’s 
new balance sheet.
d.	By what percentage do the bank’s total assets 
decline? By what percentage does the bank’s 
capital decline? Which change is larger? 
Why?
	 6.	 The Federal Reserve conducts a $10 million 
open-market purchase of government bonds. 
If the required reserve ratio is 10 percent, what 
is the largest possible increase in the money 
supply that could result? Explain. What is the 
smallest possible increase? Explain.
	 7.	 Assume that the reserve requirement is  
5 percent. All other things equal, will the money 
supply expand more if the Federal Reserve buys 
$2,000 worth of bonds or if someone deposits 
in a bank $2,000 that he had been hiding in his 
cookie jar? If one creates more, how much more 
does it create? Support your thinking.
	 8.	 Suppose that the T-account for First National 
Bank is as follows:
Assets
Liabilities
Reserves
$100,000
Deposits 
$500,000
Loans
  400,000
a.	 If the Fed requires banks to hold 5 percent 
of deposits as reserves, how much in excess 
reserves does First National now hold?
b.	Assume that all other banks hold only the 
required amount of reserves. If First National 
decides to reduce its reserves to only the 
required amount, by how much would the 
economy’s money supply increase?
	 9.	 Suppose that the reserve requirement for 
checking deposits is 10 percent and that banks 
do not hold any excess reserves.
a.	 If the Fed sells $1 million of government 
bonds, what is the effect on the economy’s 
reserves and money supply?
b.	Now suppose the Fed lowers the reserve 
requirement to 5 percent, but banks choose to 
hold another 5 percent of deposits as excess 
reserves. Why might banks do so? What is 
the overall change in the money multiplier 
and the money supply as a result of these 
actions?
	10.	 Assume that the banking system has total 
reserves of $100 billion. Assume also that 
required reserves are 10 percent of checking 
deposits and that banks hold no excess reserves 
and households hold no currency.
a.	 What is the money multiplier? What is the 
money supply?
b.	If the Fed now raises required reserves to  
20 percent of deposits, what are the changes 
in reserves and in the money supply?
	11.	 Assume that the reserve requirement is  
20 percent. Also assume that banks do not  
hold excess reserves and there is no cash held 
by the public. The Federal Reserve decides  
that it wants to expand the money supply by 
$40 million dollars. 
a.	 If the Fed is using open-market operations, 
will it buy or sell bonds?
b.	What quantity of bonds does the Fed need to 
buy or sell to accomplish the goal? Explain 
your reasoning.
	12.	 The economy of Elmendyn contains 2,000  
$1 bills.
a.	 If people hold all money as currency, what is 
the quantity of money?
b.	If people hold all money as demand deposits 
and banks maintain 100 percent reserves, 
what is the quantity of money?
c.	 If people hold equal amounts of currency 
and demand deposits and banks maintain 
100 percent reserves, what is the quantity of 
money?
d.	If people hold all money as demand deposits 
and banks maintain a reserve ratio of 10 
percent, what is the quantity of money?
e.	 If people hold equal amounts of currency 
and demand deposits and banks maintain 
a reserve ratio of 10 percent, what is the 
quantity of money?
