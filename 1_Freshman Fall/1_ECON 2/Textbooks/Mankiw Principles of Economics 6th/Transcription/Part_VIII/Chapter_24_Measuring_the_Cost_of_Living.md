Measuring the 
    Cost of Living
I
n 1931, as the U.S. economy was suffering through the Great Depression, the 
New York Yankees paid famed baseball player Babe Ruth a salary of $80,000. 
At the time, this pay was extraordinary, even among the stars of baseball. 
According to one story, a reporter asked Ruth whether he thought it was 
right that he made more than President Herbert Hoover, who had a salary of only 
$75,000. Ruth replied, “I had a better year.”
In 2010, the median salary earned by a player on the New York Yankees was 
$5.5 million, and shortstop Alex Rodriguez was paid $33 million. At first, this fact 
might lead you to think that baseball has become vastly more lucrative over the 
past eight decades. But as everyone knows, the prices of goods and services have 
also risen. In 1931, a nickel would buy an ice-cream cone, and a quarter would 
buy a ticket at the local movie theater. Because prices were so much lower in Babe 
Ruth’s day than they are today, it is not clear whether Ruth enjoyed a higher or 
lower standard of living than today’s players.

In the preceding chapter, we looked at how economists use gross domestic 
product (GDP) to measure the quantity of goods and services that the economy 
is producing. This chapter examines how economists measure the overall cost of 
living. To compare Babe Ruth’s salary of $80,000 to salaries from today, we need 
to find some way of turning dollar figures into meaningful measures of purchas-
ing power. That is exactly the job of a statistic called the consumer price index. After 
seeing how the consumer price index is constructed, we discuss how we can use 
such a price index to compare dollar figures from different points in time.
The consumer price index is used to monitor changes in the cost of living over 
time. When the consumer price index rises, the typical family has to spend more 
money to maintain the same standard of living. Economists use the term inflation to 
describe a situation in which the economy’s overall price level is rising. The inflation 
rate is the percentage change in the price level from the previous period. The pre-
ceding chapter showed how economists can measure inflation using the GDP defla-
tor. The inflation rate you are likely to hear on the nightly news, however, is not 
calculated from this statistic. Because the consumer price index better reflects the 
goods and services bought by consumers, it is the more common gauge of inflation.
As we will see in the coming chapters, inflation is a closely watched aspect 
of macroeconomic performance and is a key variable guiding macroeconomic 
policy. This chapter provides the background for that analysis by showing how 
economists measure the inflation rate using the consumer price index and how 
this statistic can be used to compare dollar figures from different times.
The Consumer Price Index
The consumer price index (CPI) is a measure of the overall cost of the goods and 
services bought by a typical consumer. Each month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS), which is part of the Department of Labor, computes and reports the con-
sumer price index. In this section, we discuss how the consumer price index is 
calculated and what problems arise in its measurement. We also consider how 
this index compares to the GDP deflator, another measure of the overall level of 
prices, which we examined in the preceding chapter.
How the Consumer Price Index Is Calculated
When the BLS calculates the consumer price index and the inflation rate, it uses 
data on the prices of thousands of goods and services. To see exactly how these 
statistics are constructed, let’s consider a simple economy in which consumers 
buy only two goods: hot dogs and hamburgers. Table 1 shows the five steps that 
the BLS follows.
	 1. 	Fix the basket. Determine which prices are most important to the typical con-
sumer. If the typical consumer buys more hot dogs than hamburgers, then 
the price of hot dogs is more important than the price of hamburgers and, 
therefore, should be given greater weight in measuring the cost of living. 
The BLS sets these weights by surveying consumers to find the basket of 
goods and services bought by the typical consumer. In the example in the 
table, the typical consumer buys a basket of 4 hot dogs and 2 hamburgers.
	 2. 	Find the prices. Find the prices of each of the goods and services in the basket 
at each point in time. The table shows the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers 
for three different years.

	 3.	 Compute the basket’s cost. Use the data on prices to calculate the cost of the 
basket of goods and services at different times. The table shows this calcula-
tion for each of the three years. Notice that only the prices in this calculation 
change. By keeping the basket of goods the same (4 hot dogs and 2 ham-
burgers), we are isolating the effects of price changes from the effect of any 
quantity changes that might be occurring at the same time.
	 4.	 Choose a base year and compute the index. Designate one year as the base year, 
the benchmark against which other years are compared. (The choice of base 
year is arbitrary, as the index is used to measure changes in the cost of 
living.) Once the base year is chosen, the index is calculated as follows:
	
Price of basket of goods and services in current year
Consumer price index = 	
 × 100.
	
Price of basket in base year
	 	 That is, the price of the basket of goods and services in each year is divided 
by the price of the basket in the base year, and this ratio is then multiplied 
by 100. The resulting number is the consumer price index.
In the example in the table, 2010 is the base year. In this year, the basket 
of hot dogs and hamburgers costs $8. Therefore, the price of the basket in all 
years is divided by $8 and multiplied by 100. The consumer price index is

Step 3: Compute the Cost of the Basket of Goods in Each Year
2010	
($1 per hot dog × 4 hot dogs) + ($2 per hamburger × 2 hamburgers) = $8 per basket
2011	
($2 per hot dog × 4 hot dogs) + ($3 per hamburger × 2 hamburgers) = $14 per basket
2012	
($3 per hot dog × 4 hot dogs) + ($4 per hamburger × 2 hamburgers) = $20 per basket
Step 4: Choose One Year as a Base Year (2010) and Compute the Consumer Price Index  
in Each Year
2010	
  ($8 / $8) × 100 = 100
2011	
($14 / $8) × 100 = 175
2012	
($20 / $8) × 100 = 250
Step 5: Use the Consumer Price Index to Compute the Inflation Rate from Previous Year
2011	
(175 – 100) / 100 × 100 = 75%

100 in 2010. (The index is always 100 in the base year.) The consumer price 
index is 175 in 2011. This means that the price of the basket in 2011 is 175 
percent of its price in the base year. Put differently, a basket of goods that 
costs $100 in the base year costs $175 in 2011. Similarly, the consumer price 
index is 250 in 2012, indicating that the price level in 2012 is 250 percent of 
the price level in the base year.
	 5.	 Compute the inflation rate. Use the consumer price index to calculate the 
inflation rate, which is the percentage change in the price index from the 
preceding period. That is, the inflation rate between two consecutive years  
is computed as follows:
	
CPI in year 2 – CPI in year 1
Inflation rate in year 2 = 	
 × 100.
	
CPI in year 1
	 	 As shown at the bottom of Table 1, the inflation rate in our example is 75 
percent in 2011 and 43 percent in 2012.

hen constructing the consumer price index, the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics tries to include all the goods and services that 
the typical consumer buys. Moreover, it tries to weight these goods 
and services according to how much consumers buy of each item. 
	
Figure 1 shows the breakdown of consumer spending into the 
major categories of goods and services. By far the largest category 
is housing, which makes up 42 percent of the typical consumer’s 
budget. This category includes the cost of shelter (32 percent), 
fuel and other utilities (5 percent), and household furnishings and 
operation (5 percent). The next largest category, at 17 percent, is 
transportation, which includes spending on cars, gasoline, buses, 
subways, and so on. The next category, at 15 percent, is food and 
beverages; this includes food at home (8 percent), food away from 
home (6 percent), and alcoholic beverages (1 percent). Next are 
medical care, recreation, and education and communication, each 
at about 6 percent. This last category includes, for example, college 
tuition and personal computers. Apparel, which includes clothing, 
footwear, and jewelry, makes up 4 percent of the typical consumer’s 
budget.
	
Also included in the figure, at 3 percent of spending, is a cate­
gory for other goods and services. This is a catchall for consumer 
purchases (such as cigarettes, haircuts, and funeral expenses) that 
do not naturally fit into the other categories.

spending among various categories of goods and 
services. The Bureau of Labor Statistics calls each

Although this example simplifies the real world by including only two 
goods, it shows how the BLS computes the consumer price index and the infla-
tion rate. The BLS collects and processes data on the prices of thousands of 
goods and services every month and, by following the five foregoing steps, 
determines how quickly the cost of living for the typical consumer is rising. 
When the BLS makes its monthly announcement of the consumer price index, 
you can usually hear the number on the evening television news or see it in the 
next day’s newspaper.
In addition to the consumer price index for the overall economy, the BLS 
calculates several other price indexes. It reports the index for specific metropoli-
tan areas within the country (such as Boston, New York, and Los Angeles) and 
for some narrow categories of goods and services (such as food, clothing, and 
energy). It also calculates the producer price index (PPI), which measures the cost 
of a basket of goods and services bought by firms rather than consumers. Because 
firms eventually pass on their costs to consumers in the form of higher consumer 
prices, changes in the producer price index are often thought to be useful in pre-
dicting changes in the consumer price index.
Problems in Measuring the Cost of Living
The goal of the consumer price index is to measure changes in the cost of living. 
In other words, the consumer price index tries to gauge how much incomes must 
rise to maintain a constant standard of living. The consumer price index, however, 
is not a perfect measure of the cost of living. Three problems with the index are 
widely acknowledged but difficult to solve.
The first problem is called substitution bias. When prices change from one year 
to the next, they do not all change proportionately: Some prices rise more than 
others. Consumers respond to these differing price changes by buying less of the 
goods whose prices have risen by relatively large amounts and by buying more 
of the goods whose prices have risen less or perhaps even have fallen. That is, 
consumers substitute toward goods that have become relatively less expensive. 
If a price index is computed assuming a fixed basket of goods, it ignores the pos-
sibility of consumer substitution and, therefore, overstates the increase in the cost 
of living from one year to the next.
Let’s consider a simple example. Imagine that in the base year, apples are 
cheaper than pears, so consumers buy more apples than pears. When the BLS 
constructs the basket of goods, it will include more apples than pears. Suppose 
that next year pears are cheaper than apples. Consumers will naturally respond to 
the price changes by buying more pears and fewer apples. Yet when computing 
the consumer price index, the BLS uses a fixed basket, which in essence assumes 
that consumers continue buying the now expensive apples in the same quantities 
as before. For this reason, the index will measure a much larger increase in the cost 
of living than consumers actually experience.
The second problem with the consumer price index is the introduction of new 
goods. When a new good is introduced, consumers have more variety from which 
to choose, and this in turn reduces the cost of maintaining the same level of eco-
nomic well-being. To see why, consider a hypothetical situation: Suppose you 
could choose between a $100 gift certificate at a large store that offered a wide 
array of goods and a $100 gift certificate at a small store with the same prices but 
a more limited selection. Which would you prefer? Most people would pick the

store with greater variety. In essence, the increased set of possible choices makes 
each dollar more valuable. The same is true with the evolution of the economy 
over time: As new goods are introduced, consumers have more choices, and each 
dollar is worth more. Yet because the consumer price index is based on a fixed 
basket of goods and services, it does not reflect the increase in the value of the 
dollar that arises from the introduction of new goods.
Again, let’s consider an example. When video cassette recorders (VCRs) were 
introduced in the late 1970s, consumers were able to watch their favorite movies 
at home. Although not a perfect substitute for a first-run movie on a large screen, 
an old movie in the comfort of your family room was a new option that increased 
consumers’ set of opportunities. For any given number of dollars, the introduc-
tion of the VCR made people better off; conversely, achieving the same level of 
economic well-being required a smaller number of dollars. A perfect cost-of-living

Price Indexers

ilmington, Del.—Her thick blue 
binder in hand, Diane Balaguer strides 
purposefully through the department store 
in the Concord Mall north of town. She 
checks the price of a women’s pullover 
(short sleeve, solid color, no design), eyes 
a Hastings & Smith polo shirt, notes the 
seasonal absence of men’s turtlenecks and 
then confronts the day’s first challenge to 
statistical perfection. 
	
Ms. Balaguer shakes her head slightly 
as she regards a rack of Towne raincoats, 
a style in the London Fog line (tagged at 
the same $99.90 as the month before). She 
considers Towne to be of slightly, almost 
imperceptibly, lesser quality than the Severn 
line (costing about twice as much) that they 
replaced this year. It’s a matter of things like 
stitching and buttons. 
	
Earlier this spring she had informed spe­
cialists in Washington of this not uncommon 
situation but they overruled her suggestion 
that she substitute another product. Thus do 
tiny imprecisions creep unavoidably into the 
Consumer Price Index, the most widely used 
inflation measure, one directly affecting the 
incomes of more than 70 million Americans, 
Federal income-tax brackets and the cost of 
school lunches. 
	
“It’s not a black-and-white sort of deter­
mination,” Ms. Balaguer said. “Even though 
we ask very specific questions to try to get 
very specific answers, it takes a great deal of 
judgment.” 
	
When the price index is announced 
monthly by the Labor Department, the 
figure has the Olympian air common to 
Government statistics. But a day spent with 
Ms. Balaguer gives a vivid illustration of the 
messiness inherent in the immense task of 
monitoring changes in a $7 trillion econ­
omy. In any given month, she and several 
hundred counterparts around the country 
check the cost of 90,000 items—ranging 
from catfish fillets to time spent in a hospital 
recovery room. . . . 
	
A trained economist who both super­
vises data collection and often goes on the 
road herself, Ms. Balaguer expresses no 
opinion about the debate over the price 
index. 
	
The system takes account of the pos­
sibility of human error or subversion— 
cross-checks of other data collectors’ work is 
standard procedure. “We’re taking our best 
shot,” said Patrick C. Jackman, the index’s 
chief day-to-day overseer in Washington. 
“I don’t think we’re picking up many bad 
quotes.”

kinds of outlets, headquarters tells the field 
staff what items to price. The findings are 
shipped by courier to Washington, where 
they are run through the mill to be sure they 
make sense. Because the bureau promises 
its respondents confidentiality, it insists that 
none of the 10 outlets Ms. Balaguer visits 
be identified by name. But she did disclose 
not only how prices in May compared with 
April’s, but also explained in detail how 
to handle such vexations as discontinued 
products, clearance sales and what to do in 
those rare cases when she suspects some­
body of giving wrong prices. 
	
One of the day’s most complicated 
readings came at a garden shop just across 
the state line in Pennsylvania where, after 
finding 3 1/2-inch barrel cactus and 16-inch 
Boston ferns unchanged in price (at $4 
and $25, respectively) Ms. Balaguer found 
that the requisite flower seeds, black-eyed 
susans, were no longer being stocked. 
	
After being told this was not just a 
temporary situation, Ms. Balaguer’s solution 
was to find a substitute seed in the same 
product line to enter into the system on the 
spot. With the aid of a table in her binder 
that produces random numbers and with 
some rapid-fire pointing at rows of seed 
packets, the answer emerged in less than a 
minute. From now on, she declared, “we’ll 
use pampas grass” in the index. 
	
Not every hurdle was so quickly over­
come. She spent a sizable chunk of her 
20-minute session with a hospital admin­
istrator to figure out how to adjust for a 
confusing reconfiguration of recovery-room 
charges that effectively halved the price. 
	
“You have to be able to ask ques­
tions, to be a sort of Sherlock Holmes,” 
Ms. Balaguer said. 
	
Ms. Balaguer’s stop at a beer distributor 
to check one-liter bottles of Canada Dry selt­
zer caused some embarrassment when she 
questioned the assertion of Richard Gropper, 
a proprietor, that the price was 84 cents. After 
she observed that this would mean a 9-cent 
rise from April he realized his mistake, adding 
that he was glad to help with the index since 
he periodically used it to adjust the rent of 
tenants in the doughnut shop next door. 
	
The hardest items to price, Ms. Balaguer 
said, are electricity and natural gas, infor­
mation the bureau gets directly from utilities 
in statistically awkward form. Children’s 
meals and meals in Chinese restaurants also 
pose problems, even with menus to work 
from, because they tend to include bever­
ages for which separate prices are required, 
Ms. Balaguer said. 
	
Housing, which accounts for 41 percent 
of the urban consumer index, is surveyed by 
periodically questioning homeowners and 
renters. For both groups, the question is 
the same: What is the monthly rental value 
of the property? When necessary, such as 
when a house is vacant, she and her staff 
ask real estate brokers and neighbors to get 
housing data, Ms. Balaguer said. 
	
Some surveyers might be bothered by 
one potentially onerous job restriction. But 
not Ms. Balaguer. 
	
“We never carry purses because we’re 
not allowed to shop while we work,” she 
said. “Actually,” she added, noting that she 
had originally worked in retailing, “I hate to 
shop.”

index would have reflected the introduction of the VCR with a decrease in the cost 
of living. The consumer price index, however, did not decrease in response to the 
introduction of the VCR. Eventually, the BLS did revise the basket of goods to 
include VCRs, and subsequently, the index reflected changes in VCR prices. But 
the reduction in the cost of living associated with the initial introduction of the 
VCR never showed up in the index. 
The third problem with the consumer price index is unmeasured quality change. 
If the quality of a good deteriorates from one year to the next while its price 
remains the same, the value of a dollar falls, because you are getting a lesser good 
for the same amount of money. Similarly, if the quality rises from one year to 
the next, the value of a dollar rises. The BLS does its best to account for quality 
change. When the quality of a good in the basket changes—for example, when a 
car model has more horsepower or gets better gas mileage from one year to the

next—the Bureau adjusts the price of the good to account for the quality change. 
It is, in essence, trying to compute the price of a basket of goods of constant qual-
ity. Despite these efforts, changes in quality remain a problem because quality is 
so hard to measure.
There is still much debate among economists about how severe these measure-
ment problems are and what should be done about them. Several studies written 
during the 1990s concluded that the consumer price index overstated inflation by 
about 1 percentage point per year. In response to this criticism, the BLS adopted 
several technical changes to improve the CPI, and many economists believe the 
bias is now only about half as large as it once was. The issue is important because 
many government programs use the consumer price index to adjust for changes 
in the overall level of prices. Recipients of Social Security, for instance, get annual 
increases in benefits that are tied to the consumer price index. Some economists 
have suggested modifying these programs to correct for the measurement prob-
lems by, for instance, reducing the magnitude of the automatic benefit increases.
The GDP Deflator versus the Consumer Price Index
In the preceding chapter, we examined another measure of the overall level of 
prices in the economy—the GDP deflator. The GDP deflator is the ratio of nomi-
nal GDP to real GDP. Because nominal GDP is current output valued at current 
prices and real GDP is current output valued at base-year prices, the GDP deflator 
reflects the current level of prices relative to the level of prices in the base year.
Economists and policymakers monitor both the GDP deflator and the con-
sumer price index to gauge how quickly prices are rising. Usually, these two sta-
tistics tell a similar story. Yet two important differences can cause them to diverge.
The first difference is that the GDP deflator reflects the prices of all goods and 
services produced domestically, whereas the consumer price index reflects the prices 
of all goods and services bought by consumers. For example, suppose that the price 
of an airplane produced by Boeing and sold to the Air Force rises. Even though 
the plane is part of GDP, it is not part of the basket of goods and services bought 
by a typical consumer. Thus, the price increase shows up in the GDP deflator but 
not in the consumer price index. 
As another example, suppose that Volvo raises the price of its cars. Because 
Volvos are made in Sweden, the car is not part of U.S. GDP. But U.S. consumers 
buy Volvos, so the car is part of the typical consumer’s basket of goods. Hence, 
a price increase in an imported consumption good, such as a Volvo, shows up in 
the consumer price index but not in the GDP deflator.
This first difference between the consumer price index and the GDP deflator is 
particularly important when the price of oil changes. Although the United States 
does produce some oil, much of the oil we use is imported. As a result, oil and 
oil products such as gasoline and heating oil are a much larger share of consumer 
spending than of GDP. When the price of oil rises, the consumer price index rises 
by much more than does the GDP deflator.
The second and subtler difference between the GDP deflator and the consumer 
price index concerns how various prices are weighted to yield a single number 
for the overall level of prices. The consumer price index compares the price of a 
fixed basket of goods and services to the price of the basket in the base year. Only 
occasionally does the Bureau of Labor Statistics change the basket of goods. By 
contrast, the GDP deflator compares the price of currently produced goods and 
services to the price of the same goods and services in the base year. Thus, the 
“The price may seem a little 
high, but you have to remember 
that’s in today’s dollars.”

group of goods and services used to compute the GDP deflator changes auto-
matically over time. This difference is not important when all prices are changing 
proportionately. But if the prices of different goods and services are changing by 
varying amounts, the way we weight the various prices matters for the overall 
inflation rate. 
Figure 2 shows the inflation rate as measured by both the GDP deflator and 
the consumer price index for each year since 1965. You can see that sometimes 
the two measures diverge. When they do diverge, it is possible to go behind these 
numbers and explain the divergence with the two differences we have discussed. 
For example, in 1979 and 1980, CPI inflation spiked up more than the GDP defla-
tor largely because oil prices more than doubled during these two years. Yet 
divergence between these two measures is the exception rather than the rule. In 
the 1970s, both the GDP deflator and the consumer price index show high rates of 
inflation. In the late 1980s, 1990s, and the first decade of the 2000s, both measures 
show low rates of inflation.

Correcting Economic Variables for the Effects of Inflation
The purpose of measuring the overall level of prices in the economy is to allow 
us to compare dollar figures from different times. Now that we know how price 
indexes are calculated, let’s see how we might use such an index to compare a 
dollar figure from the past to a dollar figure in the present.
Two Measures of 
Inflation
This figure shows the 
inflation rate—the 
percentage change in 
the level of prices—
as measured by the 
GDP deflator and the 
consumer price index 
using annual data since 
1965. Notice that the two 
measures of inflation 
generally move together.

Dollar Figures from Different Times
We first return to the issue of Babe Ruth’s salary. Was his salary of $80,000 in 1931 
high or low compared to the salaries of today’s players?
To answer this question, we need to know the level of prices in 1931 and the 
level of prices today. Part of the increase in baseball salaries compensates players 
for higher prices today. To compare Ruth’s salary to those of today’s players, we 
need to inflate Ruth’s salary to turn 1931 dollars into today’s dollars.
The formula for turning dollar figures from year T into today’s dollars is the 
following:
	
Price level today
Amount in today’s dollars = Amount in year T dollars × 	
.
	
Price level in year T
A price index such as the consumer price index measures the price level and thus 
determines the size of the inflation correction.
Let’s apply this formula to Ruth’s salary. Government statistics show a con-
sumer price index of 15.2 for 1931 and 214.5 for 2009. Thus, the overall level of 
prices has risen by a factor of 14.1 (which equals 214.5/15.2). We can use these 
numbers to measure Ruth’s salary in 2009 dollars, as follows:
	
Price level in 2009
Salary in 2009 dollars = Salary in 1931 dollars × 
	
Price level in 1931
	
214.5
	
= $80,000 × 
	
15.2
	
= $1,128,947
We find that Babe Ruth’s 1931 salary is equivalent to a salary today of over $1 
million. That is a good income, but it is less than a quarter of the median Yankee 
salary today and only 3 percent of what the Yankees pay A-Rod. Various forces, 
including overall economic growth and the increasing income shares earned by 
superstars, have substantially raised the living standards of the best athletes.
Let’s also examine President Hoover’s 1931 salary of $75,000. To translate that 
figure into 2009 dollars, we again multiply the ratio of the price levels in the two 
years. We find that Hoover’s salary is equivalent to $75,000 × (214.5/15.2), or 
$1,058,388, in 2009 dollars. This is well above President Barack Obama’s salary 
of $400,000. It seems that President Hoover did have a pretty good year after all.
Indexation
As we have just seen, price indexes are used to correct for the effects of inflation 
when comparing dollar figures from different times. This type of correction shows 
up in many places in the economy. When some dollar amount is automatically 
corrected for changes in the price level by law or contract, the amount is said to 
be indexed for inflation.
For example, many long-term contracts between firms and unions include par-
tial or complete indexation of the wage to the consumer price index. Such a provi-
sion is called a cost-of-living allowance, or COLA. A COLA automatically raises the 
wage when the consumer price index rises.
Indexation is also a feature of many laws. Social Security benefits, for example, are 
adjusted every year to compensate the elderly for increases in prices. The brackets

of the federal income tax—the income levels at which the tax rates change—are also 
indexed for inflation. There are, however, many ways in which the tax system is not 
indexed for inflation, even when perhaps it should be. We discuss these issues more 
fully when we discuss the costs of inflation later in this book.
Real and Nominal Interest Rates
Correcting economic variables for the effects of inflation is particularly important, 
and somewhat tricky, when we look at data on interest rates. The very concept 
of an interest rate necessarily involves comparing amounts of money at different 
points in time. When you deposit your savings in a bank account, you give the 
bank some money now, and the bank returns your deposit with interest in the 
future. Similarly, when you borrow from a bank, you get some money now, but 
you will have to repay the loan with interest in the future. In both cases, to fully 
understand the deal between you and the bank, it is crucial to acknowledge that 
future dollars could have a different value than today’s dollars. That is, you have 
to correct for the effects of inflation.
Let’s consider an example. Suppose Sally Saver deposits $1,000 in a bank 
account that pays an annual interest rate of 10 percent. A year later, after Sally has 
accumulated $100 in interest, she withdraws her $1,100. Is Sally $100 richer than 
she was when she made the deposit a year earlier?
The answer depends on what we mean by “richer.” Sally does have $100 more 
than she had before. In other words, the number of dollars in her possession has 
FYI
W
hat is the most popular movie of all 
time? The answer might surprise you.
	
Movie popularity is usually gauged by 
box office receipts. By that measure, Avatar 
is the number 1 movie of all time with 
domestic receipts of $749 million, followed 
by Titanic ($601 million) and The Dark 
Knight ($533 million). But this ranking 
ignores an obvious but important fact: 
Prices, including those of movie tickets, 
have been rising over time. Inflation gives 
an advantage to newer films.
	
When we correct box office receipts 
for the effects of inflation, the story is very 
different. The number 1 movie is now Gone 
with the Wind ($1,606 million), followed by 
Star Wars ($1,416 million) and The Sound 
of Music ($1,132 million). Avatar falls to 
number 14. 
    Gone with the Wind was released in 
1939, before everyone had televisions in 
their homes. In the 1930s, about 90 million 
Americans went to the cinema each week, 
compared to about 25 million today. But the 
movies from that era don’t show up in con­
ventional popularity rankings because ticket 
prices were only a quarter. And indeed, in the 
ranking based on nominal box office receipts, 
Gone with the Wind does not make the top 
50 films. Scarlett and Rhett fare a lot better 
once we correct for the effects of inflation.

risen by 10 percent. But Sally does not care about the amount of money itself: 
She cares about what she can buy with it. If prices have risen while her money 
was in the bank, each dollar now buys less than it did a year ago. In this case, her 
purchasing power—the amount of goods and services she can buy—has not risen 
by 10 percent. 
To keep things simple, let’s suppose that Sally is a movie fan and buys 
only DVDs. When Sally made her deposit, a DVD at her local movie store 
cost $10. Her deposit of $1,000 was equivalent to 100 DVDs. A year later, after 
getting her 10 percent interest, she has $1,100. How many DVDs can she buy 
now? It depends on what has happened to the price of a DVD. Here are some 
examples:
• 	 Zero inflation: If the price of a DVD remains at $10, the amount she can buy 
has risen from 100 to 110 DVDs. The 10 percent increase in the number of 
dollars means a 10 percent increase in her purchasing power.
• 	 Six percent inflation: If the price of a DVD rises from $10 to $10.60, then the 
number of DVDs she can buy has risen from 100 to approximately 104. Her 
purchasing power has increased by about 4 percent. 
• 	 Ten percent inflation: If the price of a DVD rises from $10 to $11, she can 
still buy only 100 DVDs. Even though Sally’s dollar wealth has risen, her 
purchasing power is the same as it was a year earlier. 
• 	 Twelve percent inflation: If the price of a DVD increases from $10 to $11.20, 
the number of DVDs she can buy has fallen from 100 to approximately 
98. Even with her greater number of dollars, her purchasing power has 
decreased by about 2 percent.
And if Sally were living in an economy with deflation—falling prices—another 
possibility could arise:
• 	 Two percent deflation: If the price of a DVD falls from $10 to $9.80, then the 
number of DVDs she can buy rises from 100 to approximately 112. Her pur-
chasing power increases by about 12 percent.
These examples show that the higher the rate of inflation, the smaller the increase 
in Sally’s purchasing power. If the rate of inflation exceeds the rate of interest, her 
purchasing power actually falls. And if there is deflation (that is, a negative rate 
of inflation), her purchasing power rises by more than the rate of interest.
To understand how much a person earns in a savings account, we need to 
consider both the interest rate and the change in the prices. The interest rate that 
measures the change in dollar amounts is called the nominal interest rate, and 
the interest rate corrected for inflation is called the real interest rate. The nomi-
nal interest rate, the real interest rate, and inflation are related approximately as 
follows:
Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate – Inflation rate.
The real interest rate is the difference between the nominal interest rate and the 
rate of inflation. The nominal interest rate tells you how fast the number of dollars 
in your bank account rises over time, while the real interest rate tells you how fast 
the purchasing power of your bank account rises over time.

Interest Rates in the U.S. Economy
Figure 3 shows real and nominal interest rates in the U.S. economy since 1965. The 
nominal interest rate in this figure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills (although 
data on other interest rates would be similar). The real interest rate is computed 
by subtracting the rate of inflation from this nominal interest rate. Here the infla-
tion rate is measured as the percentage change in the consumer price index.
	
One feature of this figure is that the nominal interest rate almost always exceeds 
the real interest rate. This reflects the fact that the U.S. economy has experienced 
rising consumer prices in almost every year during this period. By contrast, if you 
look at data for the U.S. economy during the late 19th century or for the Japanese 
economy in some recent years, you will find periods of deflation. During defla-
tion, the real interest rate exceeds the nominal interest rate. 
	
The figure also shows that because inflation is variable, real and nominal inter-
est rates do not always move together. For example, in the late 1970s, nominal 
interest rates were high. But because inflation was very high, real interest rates 
were low. Indeed, during much of the 1970s, real interest rates were negative, for 
inflation eroded people’s savings more quickly than nominal interest payments 
increased them. By contrast, in the late 1990s, nominal interest rates were lower 
than they had been two decades earlier. But because inflation was much lower, 
real interest rates were higher. In the coming chapters, we will examine the eco-
nomic forces that determine both real and nominal interest rates.  ■

Conclusion
“A nickel ain’t worth a dime anymore,” baseball player Yogi Berra once observed. 
Indeed, throughout recent history, the real values behind the nickel, the dime, and 
the dollar have not been stable. Persistent increases in the overall level of prices 
have been the norm. Such inflation reduces the purchasing power of each unit of 
money over time. When comparing dollar figures from different times, it is impor-
tant to keep in mind that a dollar today is not the same as a dollar twenty years 
ago or, most likely, twenty years from now.
This chapter has discussed how economists measure the overall level of prices 
in the economy and how they use price indexes to correct economic variables 
for the effects of inflation. Price indexes allow us to compare dollar figures from 
different points in time and, therefore, get a better sense of how the economy is 
changing. 
The discussion of price indexes in this chapter, together with the preceding 
chapter’s discussion of GDP, is only a first step in the study of macroeconomics. 
We have not yet examined what determines a nation’s GDP or the causes and 
effects of inflation. To do that, we need to go beyond issues of measurement. 
Indeed, that is our next task. Having explained how economists measure mac-
roeconomic quantities and prices in the past two chapters, we are now ready to 
develop the models that explain movements in these variables.
Here is our strategy in the upcoming chapters. First, we look at the long-run 
determinants of real GDP and related variables, such as saving, investment, real 
interest rates, and unemployment. Second, we look at the long-run determinants 
of the price level and related variables, such as the money supply, inflation, and 
nominal interest rates. Last of all, having seen how these variables are determined 
in the long run, we examine the more complex question of what causes short-run 
fluctuations in real GDP and the price level. In all of these chapters, the measure-
ment issues we have just discussed will provide the foundation for the analysis.
Summary
• The consumer price index shows the cost of a 
basket of goods and services relative to the cost 
of the same basket in the base year. The index 
is used to measure the overall level of prices 
in the economy. The percentage change in the 
consumer price index measures the inflation rate.
• The consumer price index is an imperfect 
measure of the cost of living for three reasons. 
First, it does not take into account consumers’ 
ability to substitute toward goods that become 
relatively cheaper over time. Second, it does not 
take into account increases in the purchasing 
power of the dollar due to the introduction of 
new goods. Third, it is distorted by unmeasured 
changes in the quality of goods and services. 
Because of these measurement problems, the CPI 
overstates true inflation.
• Like the consumer price index, the GDP deflator 
measures the overall level of prices in the 
economy. The two price indexes usually move 
together, but there are important differences. 
The GDP deflator differs from the CPI because 
it includes goods and services produced rather 
than goods and services consumed. As a result, 
imported goods affect the consumer price index 
but not the GDP deflator. In addition, while 
the consumer price index uses a fixed basket of 
goods, the GDP deflator automatically changes 
the group of goods and services over time as the 
composition of GDP changes.

• Dollar figures from different times do not 
represent a valid comparison of purchasing 
power. To compare a dollar figure from the past 
to a dollar figure today, the older figure should 
be inflated using a price index. 
• Various laws and private contracts use price 
indexes to correct for the effects of inflation. The 
tax laws, however, are only partially indexed for 
inflation.
• A correction for inflation is especially important 
when looking at data on interest rates. The 
nominal interest rate is the interest rate usually 
reported; it is the rate at which the number 
of dollars in a savings account increases over 
time. By contrast, the real interest rate takes into 
account changes in the value of the dollar over 
time. The real interest rate equals the nominal 
interest rate minus the rate of inflation.
