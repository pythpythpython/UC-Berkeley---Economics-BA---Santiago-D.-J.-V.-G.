W
hen you finish school and start looking for a full-time job, your 
experience will, to a large extent, be shaped by prevailing eco-
nomic conditions. In some years, firms throughout the economy 
are expanding their production of goods and services, employment 
is rising, and jobs are easy to find. In other years, firms are cutting back produc-
tion, employment is declining, and finding a good job takes a long time. Not 
surprisingly, any college graduate would rather enter the labor force in a year of 
economic expansion than in a year of economic contraction.
Because the health of the overall economy profoundly affects all of us, changes 
in economic conditions are widely reported by the media. Indeed, it is hard to 
pick up a newspaper, check an online news service, or turn on the TV without 
seeing some newly reported statistic about the economy. The statistic might 
measure the total income of everyone in the economy (gross domestic product, or 
GDP), the rate at which average prices are rising or falling (inflation/deflation), the

percentage of the labor force that is out of work (unemployment), total spending 
at stores (retail sales), or the imbalance of trade between the United States and the 
rest of the world (the trade deficit). All these statistics are macroeconomic. Rather 
than telling us about a particular household, firm, or market, they tell us some-
thing about the entire economy. 
As you may recall from Chapter 2, economics is divided into two branches: 
microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics is the study of how 
individual households and firms make decisions and how they interact with one 
another in markets. Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole. 
The goal of macroeconomics is to explain the economic changes that affect many 
households, firms, and markets simultaneously. Macroeconomists address 
diverse questions: Why is average income high in some countries while it is low 
in others? Why do prices sometimes rise rapidly while at other times they are 
more stable? Why do production and employment expand in some years and 
contract in others? What, if anything, can the government do to promote rapid 
growth in incomes, low inflation, and stable employment? These questions are 
all macroeconomic in nature because they concern the workings of the entire 
economy.
Because the economy as a whole is a collection of many households and many 
firms interacting in many markets, microeconomics and macroeconomics are 
closely linked. The basic tools of supply and demand, for instance, are as central 
to macroeconomic analysis as they are to microeconomic analysis. Yet studying 
the economy in its entirety raises some new and intriguing challenges.
In this and the next chapter, we discuss some of the data that economists and 
policymakers use to monitor the performance of the overall economy. These data 
reflect the economic changes that macroeconomists try to explain. This chapter 
considers gross domestic product, which measures the total income of a nation. GDP 
is the most closely watched economic statistic because it is thought to be the best 
single measure of a society’s economic well-being.
The Economy’s Income and Expenditure
If you were to judge how a person is doing economically, you might first look at 
his or her income. A person with a high income can more easily afford life’s neces-
sities and luxuries. It is no surprise that people with higher incomes enjoy higher 
standards of living—better housing, better healthcare, fancier cars, more opulent 
vacations, and so on. 
The same logic applies to a nation’s overall economy. When judging whether 
the economy is doing well or poorly, it is natural to look at the total income that 
everyone in the economy is earning. That is the task of gross domestic product.
GDP measures two things at once: the total income of everyone in the economy 
and the total expenditure on the economy’s output of goods and services. GDP 
can perform the trick of measuring both total income and total expenditure 
because these two things are really the same. For an economy as a whole, income 
must equal expenditure.
Why is this true? An economy’s income is the same as its expenditure because 
every transaction has two parties: a buyer and a seller. Every dollar of spending by 
some buyer is a dollar of income for some seller. Suppose, for instance, that Karen 
pays Doug $100 to mow her lawn. In this case, Doug is a seller of a service, and 
Karen is a buyer. Doug earns $100, and Karen spends $100. Thus, the transaction

contributes equally to the economy’s income and to its expenditure. GDP, whether 
measured as total income or total expenditure, rises by $100.
Another way to see the equality of income and expenditure is with the 
circular-flow diagram in Figure 1. As you may recall from Chapter 2, this dia-
gram describes all the transactions between households and firms in a simple 
economy. It simplifies matters by assuming that all goods and services are 
bought by households and that households spend all of their income. In this 
economy, when households buy goods and services from firms, these expendi-
tures flow through the markets for goods and services. When the firms in turn 
use the money they receive from sales to pay workers’ wages, landowners’ rent, 
and firm owners’ profit, this income flows through the markets for the factors of 
production. Money continuously flows from households to firms and then back 
to households.
GDP measures this flow of money. We can compute it for this economy in one 
of two ways: by adding up the total expenditure by households or by adding up 
the total income (wages, rent, and profit) paid by firms. Because all expenditure 
in the economy ends up as someone’s income, GDP is the same regardless of how 
we compute it.
The actual economy is, of course, more complicated than the one illustrated in 
Figure 1. Households do not spend all of their income; they pay some of it to the 
government in taxes, and they save some for use in the future. In addition, house-
holds do not buy all goods and services produced in the economy; some goods 
and services are bought by governments, and some are bought by firms that

plan to use them in the future to produce their own output. Yet the basic lesson 
remains the same: Regardless of whether a household, government, or firm buys 
a good or service, the transaction has a buyer and seller. Thus, for the economy as 
a whole, expenditure and income are always the same. 
Quick Quiz  What two things does gross domestic product measure? How can it 
measure two things at once?
The Measurement of Gross Domestic Product
Having discussed the meaning of gross domestic product in general terms, let’s 
be more precise about how this statistic is measured. Here is a definition of GDP 
that focuses on GDP as a measure of total expenditure: 
• 	 Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and 
services produced within a country in a given period of time.
This definition might seem simple enough. But in fact, many subtle issues arise 
when computing an economy’s GDP. Let’s therefore consider each phrase in this 
definition with some care.
“GDP Is the Market Value . . .”
You have probably heard the adage, “You can’t compare apples and oranges.” Yet 
GDP does exactly that. GDP adds together many different kinds of products into a 
single measure of the value of economic activity. To do this, it uses market prices. 
Because market prices measure the amount people are willing to pay for different 
goods, they reflect the value of those goods. If the price of an apple is twice the 
price of an orange, then an apple contributes twice as much to GDP as does an 
orange. 
“. . . of All . . .”
GDP tries to be comprehensive. It includes all items produced in the economy and 
sold legally in markets. GDP measures the market value of not just apples and 
oranges but also pears and grapefruit, books and movies, haircuts and healthcare, 
and on and on. 
GDP also includes the market value of the housing services provided by the 
economy’s stock of housing. For rental housing, this value is easy to calculate—
the rent equals both the tenant’s expenditure and the landlord’s income. Yet many 
people own the place where they live and, therefore, do not pay rent. The govern-
ment includes this owner-occupied housing in GDP by estimating its rental value. 
In effect, GDP is based on the assumption that the owner is renting the house to 
himself. The imputed rent is included both in the homeowner’s expenditure and 
in his income, so it adds to GDP.
There are some products, however, that GDP excludes because measuring 
them is so difficult. GDP excludes most items produced and sold illicitly, such 
as illegal drugs. It also excludes most items that are produced and consumed at 
home and, therefore, never enter the marketplace. Vegetables you buy at the gro-
cery store are part of GDP; vegetables you grow in your garden are not.
These exclusions from GDP can at times lead to paradoxical results. For exam-
ple, when Karen pays Doug to mow her lawn, that transaction is part of GDP. If

the market value of all 
final goods and services

in a given period of time

Karen were to marry Doug, the situation would change. Even though Doug may 
continue to mow Karen’s lawn, the value of the mowing is now left out of GDP 
because Doug’s service is no longer sold in a market. Thus, when Karen and Doug 
marry, GDP falls.
“. . . Final . . .”
When International Paper makes paper, which Hallmark then uses to make a 
greeting card, the paper is called an intermediate good, and the card is called a final 
good. GDP includes only the value of final goods. This is done because the value 
of intermediate goods is already included in the prices of the final goods. Adding 
the market value of the paper to the market value of the card would be double 
counting. That is, it would (incorrectly) count the paper twice. 
An important exception to this principle arises when an intermediate good is 
produced and, rather than being used, is added to a firm’s inventory of goods for 
use or sale at a later date. In this case, the intermediate good is taken to be “final” 
for the moment, and its value as inventory investment is included as part of GDP. 
Thus, additions to inventory add to GDP, and when the goods in inventory are 
later used or sold, the reductions in inventory subtract from GDP. 
“. . . Goods and Services . . .”
GDP includes both tangible goods (food, clothing, cars) and intangible services 
(haircuts, housecleaning, doctor visits). When you buy a CD by your favorite 
band, you are buying a good, and the purchase price is part of GDP. When you 
pay to hear a concert by the same band, you are buying a service, and the ticket 
price is also part of GDP.
“. . . Produced . . .”
GDP includes goods and services currently produced. It does not include transac-
tions involving items produced in the past. When Ford produces and sells a new 
car, the value of the car is included in GDP. When one person sells a used car to 
another person, the value of the used car is not included in GDP.
“. . . Within a Country . . .”
GDP measures the value of production within the geographic confines of a coun-
try. When a Canadian citizen works temporarily in the United States, her produc-
tion is part of U.S. GDP. When an American citizen owns a factory in Haiti, the 
production at his factory is not part of U.S. GDP. (It is part of Haiti’s GDP.) Thus, 
items are included in a nation’s GDP if they are produced domestically, regardless 
of the nationality of the producer.
“. . . In a Given Period of Time.”
GDP measures the value of production that takes place within a specific interval 
of time. Usually, that interval is a year or a quarter (three months). GDP measures 
the economy’s flow of income and expenditure during that interval.
When the government reports the GDP for a quarter, it usually presents GDP 
“at an annual rate.” This means that the figure reported for quarterly GDP is the 
amount of income and expenditure during the quarter multiplied by 4. The gov-
ernment uses this convention so that quarterly and annual figures on GDP can be 
compared more easily.

In addition, when the government reports quarterly GDP, it presents the data 
after they have been modified by a statistical procedure called seasonal adjust-
ment. The unadjusted data show clearly that the economy produces more goods 
and services during some times of year than during others. (As you might guess, 
December’s holiday shopping season is a high point.) When monitoring the con-
dition of the economy, economists and policymakers often want to look beyond 
these regular seasonal changes. Therefore, government statisticians adjust the 
quarterly data to take out the seasonal cycle. The GDP data reported in the news 
are always seasonally adjusted. 
Now let’s repeat the definition of GDP:
• 	 Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and  
services produced within a country in a given period of time.
This definition focuses on GDP as total expenditure in the economy. But don’t 
forget that every dollar spent by a buyer of a good or service becomes a dollar 
of income to the seller of that good or service. Therefore, in addition to applying 
this definition, the government adds up total income in the economy. The two 
ways of calculating GDP give almost exactly the same answer. (Why “almost”? 
Although the two measures should be precisely the same, data sources are not 
perfect. The difference between the two calculations of GDP is called the statistical 
discrepancy.) 
It should be apparent that GDP is a sophisticated measure of the value of 
economic activity. In advanced courses in macroeconomics, you will learn more 
about the subtleties that arise in its calculation. But even now you can see that 
each phrase in this definition is packed with meaning. 
Quick Quiz  Which contributes more to GDP—the production of a pound of 
hamburger or the production of a pound of caviar? Why?
The Components of GDP
Spending in the economy takes many forms. At any moment, the Smith family 
may be having lunch at Burger King; Ford may be building a car factory; the Navy 
may be procuring a submarine; and British Airways may be buying an airplane 
from Boeing. GDP includes all of these various forms of spending on domestically 
produced goods and services.
To understand how the economy is using its scarce resources, economists 
study the composition of GDP among various types of spending. To do this, GDP 
(which we denote as Y) is divided into four components: consumption (C), invest-
ment (I), government purchases (G), and net exports (NX):
Y = C + I + G + NX.
This equation is an identity—an equation that must be true because of how the 
variables in the equation are defined. In this case, because each dollar of expendi-
ture included in GDP is placed into one of the four components of GDP, the total 
of the four components must be equal to GDP. Let’s look at each of these four 
components more closely.

FYI
 Other Measures of Income
W
hen the U.S. Department of Commerce computes the nation’s 
GDP every three months, it also computes various other 
measures of income to get a more complete picture of what’s hap-
pening in the economy. These other measures differ from GDP by 
excluding or including certain categories of income. What follows is 
a brief description of five of these income measures, ordered from 
largest to smallest.
• 
Gross national product (GNP) is the total income earned by a 
nation’s permanent residents (called nationals). It differs from 
GDP by including income that our citizens earn abroad and 
excluding income that foreigners earn here. For example, when 
a Canadian citizen works temporarily in the United States, her 
production is part of U.S. GDP, but it is not part of U.S. GNP. (It is 
part of Canada’s GNP.) For most countries, including the United 
States, domestic residents are responsible for most domestic 
production, so GDP and GNP are quite close.
• 
Net national product (NNP) is the total income of a nation’s resi-
dents (GNP) minus losses from depreciation. Depreciation is the 
wear and tear on the economy’s stock of equipment and struc-
tures, such as trucks rusting and computers becoming obsolete. 
In the national income accounts prepared by the Department 
of Commerce, depreciation is called the “consumption of fixed 
capital.”
• 
National income is the total income earned by a nation’s residents 
in the production of goods and services. It is almost ­identical 
to net national product. These two measures differ because 
of the statistical discrepancy that arises from problems in data 
collection.
• 
Personal income is the income that households and noncorporate 
businesses receive. Unlike national income, it excludes retained 
earnings, which is income that corporations have earned but 
have not paid out to their owners. It also subtracts indirect busi-
ness taxes (such as sales taxes), corporate income taxes, and 
contributions for social insurance (mostly Social Security taxes). 
In addition, personal income includes the interest income that 
households receive from their holdings of government debt and 
the income that households receive from government transfer 
programs, such as welfare and Social Security.
• 
Disposable personal income is the income that households 
and noncorporate businesses have left after satisfying all their 
obligations to the government. It equals personal income minus 
personal taxes and certain nontax payments (such as traffic 
tickets).
Although the various measures of income differ in detail, they 
almost always tell the same story about economic conditions. 
When GDP is growing rapidly, these other measures of income 
are usually growing rapidly. And when GDP is falling, these other 
measures are usually falling as well. For monitoring fluctuations in 
the overall economy, it does not matter much which measure of 
income we use.
Consumption
Consumption is spending by households on goods and services, with the excep-
tion of purchases of new housing. Goods include household spending on durable 
goods, such as automobiles and appliances, and nondurable goods, such as food 
and clothing. Services include such intangible items as haircuts and medical care. 
Household spending on education is also included in consumption of services 
(although one might argue that it would fit better in the next component). 
Investment
Investment is the purchase of goods that will be used in the future to produce more 
goods and services. It is the sum of purchases of capital equipment, inventories, 
consumption
spending by households 
on goods and services, 
with the exception of 
purchases of new housing

equipment, inventories,

and structures. Investment in structures includes expenditure on new housing. By 
convention, the purchase of a new house is the one form of household spending 
categorized as investment rather than consumption.
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the treatment of inventory accumula-
tion is noteworthy. When Dell produces a computer and adds it to its inventory 
instead of selling it, Dell is assumed to have “purchased” the computer for itself. 
That is, the national income accountants treat the computer as part of Dell’s 
investment spending. (If Dell later sells the computer out of inventory, Dell’s 
inventory investment will then be negative, offsetting the positive expenditure of 
the buyer.) Inventories are treated this way because one aim of GDP is to measure 
the value of the economy’s production, and goods added to inventory are part of 
that period’s production.
Notice that GDP accounting uses the word investment differently from how 
you might hear the term in everyday conversation. When you hear the word 
investment, you might think of financial investments, such as stocks, bonds, and 
mutual funds—topics that we study later in this book. By contrast, because GDP 
measures expenditure on goods and services, here the word investment means 
purchases of goods (such as capital equipment, structures, and inventories) used 
to produce other goods. 
Government Purchases
Government purchases include spending on goods and services by local, state, 
and federal governments. It includes the salaries of government workers as well 
as expenditures on public works. Recently, the U.S. national income accounts 
have switched to the longer label government consumption expenditure and gross 
investment, but in this book, we will use the traditional and shorter term govern-
ment purchases.
The meaning of government purchases requires a bit of clarification. When the 
government pays the salary of an Army general or a schoolteacher, that salary is 
part of government purchases. But when the government pays a Social Security 
benefit to a person who is elderly or an unemployment insurance benefit to a 
worker who was recently laid off, the story is very different: These are called 
transfer payments because they are not made in exchange for a currently produced 
good or service. Transfer payments alter household income, but they do not 
reflect the economy’s production. (From a macroeconomic standpoint, transfer 
payments are like negative taxes.) Because GDP is intended to measure income 
from, and expenditure on, the production of goods and services, transfer pay-
ments are not counted as part of government purchases.
Net Exports
Net exports equal the foreign purchases of domestically produced goods 
(exports) minus the domestic purchases of foreign goods (imports). A domestic 
firm’s sale to a buyer in another country, such as Boeing’s sale of an airplane to 
British Airways, increases net exports.
The net in net exports refers to the fact that imports are subtracted from exports. 
This subtraction is made because other components of GDP include imports of 
goods and services. For example, suppose that a household buys a $30,000 car 
from Volvo, the Swedish carmaker. That transaction increases consumption by 
$30,000 because car purchases are part of consumer spending. It also reduces 
net exports by $30,000 because the car is an import. In other words, net exports

and federal governments

include goods and services produced abroad (with a minus sign) because these 
goods and services are included in consumption, investment, and government 
purchases (with a plus sign). Thus, when a domestic household, firm, or govern-
ment buys a good or service from abroad, the purchase reduces net exports, but 
because it also raises consumption, investment, or government purchases, it does 
not affect GDP.
The Components of U.S. GDP
Table 1 shows the composition of U.S. GDP in 2009. In this year, the GDP of the 
United States was over $14 trillion. Dividing this number by the 2009 U.S. popula-
tion of 307 million yields GDP per person (sometimes called GDP per capita). In 
2009 the income and expenditure of the average American was $46,372.
	
Consumption made up 71 percent of GDP, or $32,823 per person. Investment 
was $5,278 per person. Government purchases were $9,540 per person. Net 
exports were –$1,269 per person. This number is negative because Americans 
spent more on foreign goods than foreigners spent on American goods.
	
These data come from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the part of the U.S. 
Department of Commerce that produces the national income accounts. You can 
find more recent data on GDP at its website, http://www.bea.gov.  ■
Quick Quiz  List the four components of expenditure. Which is the largest?
Real versus Nominal GDP
As we have seen, GDP measures the total spending on goods and services in all 
markets in the economy. If total spending rises from one year to the next, at least 
one of two things must be true: (1) the economy is producing a larger output 
of goods and services, or (2) goods and services are being sold at higher prices. 
When studying changes in the economy over time, economists want to separate 
these two effects. In particular, they want a measure of the total quantity of goods 
and services the economy is producing that is not affected by changes in the prices 
of those goods and services.

To do this, economists use a measure called real GDP. Real GDP answers a 
hypothetical question: What would be the value of the goods and services pro-
duced this year if we valued these goods and services at the prices that prevailed 
in some specific year in the past? By evaluating current production using prices 
that are fixed at past levels, real GDP shows how the economy’s overall produc-
tion of goods and services changes over time.
To see more precisely how real GDP is constructed, let’s consider an example.
A Numerical Example
Table 2 shows some data for an economy that produces only two goods: hot dogs 
and hamburgers. The table shows the prices and quantities produced of the two 
goods in the years 2010, 2011, and 2012.
To compute total spending in this economy, we would multiply the quantities 
of hot dogs and hamburgers by their prices. In the year 2010, 100 hot dogs are sold 
at a price of $1 per hot dog, so expenditure on hot dogs equals $100. In the same 
year, 50 hamburgers are sold for $2 per hamburger, so expenditure on hamburg-
ers also equals $100. Total expenditure in the economy—the sum of expenditure 
on hot dogs and expenditure on hamburgers—is $200. This amount, the produc-
tion of goods and services valued at current prices, is called nominal GDP.
The table shows the calculation of nominal GDP for these three years. Total 
spending rises from $200 in 2010 to $600 in 2011 and then to $1,200 in 2012. 
Part of this rise is attributable to the increase in the quantities of hot dogs and 
hamburgers, and part is attributable to the increase in the prices of hot dogs and

To obtain a measure of the amount produced that is not affected by changes in 
prices, we use real GDP, which is the production of goods and services valued at 
constant prices. We calculate real GDP by first designating one year as a base year. 
We then use the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers in the base year to compute 
the value of goods and services in all the years. In other words, the prices in the 
base year provide the basis for comparing quantities in different years.
Suppose that we choose 2010 to be the base year in our example. We can then 
use the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers in 2010 to compute the value of goods 
and services produced in 2010, 2011, and 2012. Table 2 shows these calculations. 
To compute real GDP for 2010, we use the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers 
in 2010 (the base year) and the quantities of hot dogs and hamburgers produced 
in 2010. (Thus, for the base year, real GDP always equals nominal GDP.) To 
compute real GDP for 2011, we use the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers in 
2010 (the base year) and the quantities of hot dogs and hamburgers produced in 
2011. Similarly, to compute real GDP for 2012, we use the prices in 2010 and the 
quantities in 2012. When we find that real GDP has risen from $200 in 2010 to 
$350 in 2011 and then to $500 in 2012, we know that the increase is attributable 
to an increase in the quantities produced because the prices are being held fixed 
at base-year levels.
To sum up: Nominal GDP uses current prices to place a value on the economy’s pro-
duction of goods and services. Real GDP uses constant base-year prices to place a value 
on the economy’s production of goods and services. Because real GDP is not affected by 
changes in prices, changes in real GDP reflect only changes in the amounts being 
produced. Thus, real GDP is a measure of the economy’s production of goods and 
services. 
Our goal in computing GDP is to gauge how well the overall economy is per-
forming. Because real GDP measures the economy’s production of goods and 
services, it reflects the economy’s ability to satisfy people’s needs and desires. 
Thus, real GDP is a better gauge of economic well-being than is nominal GDP. 
When economists talk about the economy’s GDP, they usually mean real GDP 
rather than nominal GDP. And when they talk about growth in the economy, 
they measure that growth as the percentage change in real GDP from one period 
to another.
The GDP Deflator
As we have just seen, nominal GDP reflects both the quantities of goods and 
services the economy is producing and the prices of those goods and services. By 
contrast, by holding prices constant at base-year levels, real GDP reflects only the 
quantities produced. From these two statistics, we can compute a third, called the 
GDP deflator, which reflects only the prices of goods and services.
The GDP deflator is calculated as follows:
GDP deflator = Nominal GDP × 100.
Real GDP
Because nominal GDP and real GDP must be the same in the base year, the GDP 
deflator for the base year always equals 100. The GDP deflator for subsequent 
years measures the change in nominal GDP from the base year that cannot be 
attributable to a change in real GDP.
The GDP deflator measures the current level of prices relative to the level 
of prices in the base year. To see why this is true, consider a couple of simple

and services valued at

examples. First, imagine that the quantities produced in the economy rise over 
time but prices remain the same. In this case, both nominal and real GDP rise 
together, so the GDP deflator is constant. Now suppose, instead, that prices rise 
over time but the quantities produced stay the same. In this second case, nomi-
nal GDP rises but real GDP remains the same, so the GDP deflator rises as well. 
Notice that, in both cases, the GDP deflator reflects what’s happening to prices, 
not quantities. 
Let’s now return to our numerical example in Table 2. The GDP deflator is 
computed at the bottom of the table. For year 2010, nominal GDP is $200, and real 
GDP is $200, so the GDP deflator is 100. (The deflator is always 100 in the base 
year.) For the year 2011, nominal GDP is $600, and real GDP is $350, so the GDP 
deflator is 171. 
Economists use the term inflation to describe a situation in which the economy’s 
overall price level is rising. The inflation rate is the percentage change in some 
measure of the price level from one period to the next. Using the GDP deflator, the 
inflation rate between two consecutive years is computed as follows:
Inflation rate in year 2 = GDP deflator in year 2 – GDP deflator in year 1 × 100.
GDP deflator in year 1
Because the GDP deflator rose in year 2011 from 100 to 171, the inflation rate 
is 100 × (171 – 100)/100, or 71 percent. In 2012, the GDP deflator rose to 240 
from 171 the previous year, so the inflation rate is 100 × (240 – 171)/171, or 
40 percent. 
The GDP deflator is one measure that economists use to monitor the average 
level of prices in the economy and thus the rate of inflation. The GDP deflator 
gets its name because it can be used to take inflation out of nominal GDP—that 
is, to “deflate” nominal GDP for the rise that is due to increases in prices. We 
examine another measure of the economy’s price level, called the consumer price 
index, in the next chapter, where we also describe the differences between the 
two measures.
Real GDP over Recent History
Now that we know how real GDP is defined and measured, let’s look at what 
this macroeconomic variable tells us about the recent history of the United States. 
Figure 2 shows quarterly data on real GDP for the U.S. economy since 1965. 
	
The most obvious feature of these data is that real GDP grows over time. The 
real GDP of the U.S. economy in 2009 was almost four times its 1965 level. Put 
differently, the output of goods and services produced in the United States has 
grown on average about 3 percent per year. This continued growth in real GDP 
enables the typical American to enjoy greater economic prosperity than his or her 
parents and grandparents did.
	
A second feature of the GDP data is that growth is not steady. The upward 
climb of real GDP is occasionally interrupted by periods during which GDP 
declines, called recessions. Figure 2 marks recessions with shaded vertical bars. 
(There is no ironclad rule for when the official business cycle dating committee 
will declare that a recession has occurred, but an old rule of thumb is two consecu-
tive quarters of falling real GDP.) Recessions are associated not only with lower

incomes but also with other forms of economic distress: rising unemployment, 
falling profits, increased bankruptcies, and so on.
	
Much of macroeconomics is aimed at explaining the long-run growth and 
short-run fluctuations in real GDP. As we will see in the coming chapters, we 
need different models for these two purposes. Because the short-run fluctuations 
represent deviations from the long-run trend, we first examine the behavior of 
key macroeconomic variables, including real GDP, in the long run. Then in later 
chapters, we build on this analysis to explain short-run fluctuations.  ■
Quick Quiz  Define real GDP and nominal GDP. Which is a better measure of 
economic well-being? Why?
Is GDP a Good Measure of Economic Well-Being?
Earlier in this chapter, GDP was called the best single measure of the economic 
well-being of a society. Now that we know what GDP is, we can evaluate this claim.
As we have seen, GDP measures both the economy’s total income and the econ-
omy’s total expenditure on goods and services. Thus, GDP per person tells us the 
income and expenditure of the average person in the economy. Because most people 
would prefer to receive higher income and enjoy higher expenditure, GDP per per-
son seems a natural measure of the economic well-being of the average individual. 
Yet some people dispute the validity of GDP as a measure of well-being. When 
Senator Robert Kennedy was running for president in 1968, he gave a moving 
critique of such economic measures:
[Gross domestic product] does not allow for the health of our children, the 
quality of their education, or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty

of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public 
debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our courage, 
nor our wisdom, nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything, in 
short, except that which makes life worthwhile, and it can tell us everything 
about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.
Much of what Robert Kennedy said is correct. Why, then, do we care about GDP?
The answer is that a large GDP does in fact help us to lead a good life. GDP 
does not measure the health of our children, but nations with larger GDP can 
afford better healthcare for their children. GDP does not measure the quality 
of their education, but nations with larger GDP can afford better educational 
systems. GDP does not measure the beauty of our poetry, but nations with 
larger GDP can afford to teach more of their citizens to read and enjoy poetry. 
GDP does not take account of our intelligence, integrity, courage, wisdom, 
Searching for the 
Hidden Economy
By Doug Campbell
H
ere is the brief, unremarkable story of 
how I recently came to participate in the 
underground economy:
	
Midafternoon on the iciest day this past 
winter, a man knocked at my front door. 
“Shovel your walk?” he asked. “Only $5.”
	
Outside, it was a bone-chilling 15 
degrees. “Sold,” I said. A half-hour later I 
handed over a five-dollar bill and thanked 
him for saving me the trouble.
	
Officially, this was an unofficial trans-
action—off the books, with no taxes 
paid or safety regulations followed. (At 
least, I assume this hired hand didn’t 
bother to report that income or register 
with the proper authorities.) As such, it 
was technically illegal. And, of course, 
it’s the sort of thing that happens all the 
time.
	
The size of the official U.S. economy, 
as measured by Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP), was almost $12 trillion in 2004. 
Measurements of the unofficial economy— 
not including illegal activities like drug 
dealing and prostitution—differ substan-
tially. But it’s generally agreed to be signifi-
cant, somewhere between 6 percent and 20 
percent of GDP. At the midpoint, this would 
be about $1.5 trillion a year.
	
Broadly defined, the underground, gray, 
informal, or shadow economy involves oth-
erwise legal transactions that go unreported 
or unrecorded. That’s a wide net, capturing 
everything from babysitting fees, to barter-
ing home repairs with a neighbor, to fail-
ing to report pay from moonlighting gigs. 
The “underground” label tends to make it 
sound much more sinister than it really is.

or devotion to country, but all of these laudable attributes are easier to foster 
when people are less concerned about being able to afford the material neces-
sities of life. In short, GDP does not directly measure those things that make 
life worthwhile, but it does measure our ability to obtain many of the inputs 
into a worthwhile life. 
GDP is not, however, a perfect measure of well-being. Some things that con-
tribute to a good life are left out of GDP. One is leisure. Suppose, for instance, 
that everyone in the economy suddenly started working every day of the week, 
rather than enjoying leisure on weekends. More goods and services would be 
produced, and GDP would rise. Yet despite the increase in GDP, we should not 
conclude that everyone would be better off. The loss from reduced leisure would 
offset the gain from producing and consuming a greater quantity of goods and 
services.
	
Criminal activities make up a large 
portion of what could be termed the total 
underground economy. Many studies have 
been done on the economics of drug 
dealing, prostitution, and gambling. But 
because money from crime is almost never 
recovered, many policymakers are more 
interested in portions of the underground 
economy that otherwise would be legal 
if not hidden from authorities. Things like 
shoveling walks.
	
Despite its intrigue, the informal econo-
my’s importance and consequences remain 
in debate. The reason: “You’re trying to 
measure a phenomenon whose entire pur-
pose is to hide itself from observation,” says 
Ed Feige, an economist at the University of 
Wisconsin.
	
This uncertainty poses problems for 
policymakers. Without knowing the precise 
size, scope, and causes of the underground 
economy, how can they decide what—if 
anything—to do about it? 
	
Was the man who shoveled my walk 
engaging in a socially positive or negative 
activity? Was I? Suffice it to say, some 
economists have dedicated their entire 
careers to answering questions about the 
underground economy—and still there is 
nothing close to a consensus about its size 
or description. . . .
	
Economists generally agree that the 
shadow economy is worse in developing 
nations, whose webs of bureaucratic red 
tape and corruption are notorious. For 
instance, [economist Friedrich] Schneider 
in 2003 published “shadow economy” esti-
mates (defined broadly as all market-based, 
legal production of goods and services 
deliberately concealed from the authorities) 
for countries including: Zimbabwe, esti-
mated at a whopping 63.2 percent of GDP, 
Thailand’s at 54.1 percent, and Bolivia’s at 
68.3 percent. Among former Soviet bloc 
nations, Georgia led the way with a 68 per-
cent of GDP shadow economy, and together 
those nations had an average 40.1 percent 
of GDP underground. This contrasts with an 
average of 16.7 percent among Western 
nations. . . .
	
In his 2003 book, Reefer Madness: Sex, 
Drugs and Cheap Labor in the American 
Black Market, investigative writer Eric 
Schlosser invokes Adam Smith’s “invis-
ible hand” theory that men pursuing their 
own self-interest will generate benefits 
for society as a whole. This invisible hand 
has produced a fairly sizable underground 
economy, and we cannot understand our 
entire economic system without under-
standing how the hidden underbelly func-
tions, too. “The underground is a good 
measure of the progress and the health of 
nations,” Schlosser writes. “When much 
is wrong, much needs to be hidden.” 
Schlosser’s implication was that much is 
wrong in the United States. If he had taken 
a more global view, he might have decided 
relatively little is hidden here.

Because GDP uses market prices to value goods and services, it excludes the 
value of almost all activity that takes place outside markets. In particular, GDP 
omits the value of goods and services produced at home. When a chef prepares a 
delicious meal and sells it at his restaurant, the value of that meal is part of GDP. 
But if the chef prepares the same meal for his family, the value he has added to 
the raw ingredients is left out of GDP. Similarly, child care provided in day-care 
centers is part of GDP, whereas child care by parents at home is not. Volunteer 
work also contributes to the well-being of those in society, but GDP does not 
reflect these contributions. 
Another thing that GDP excludes is the quality of the environment. Imagine 
that the government eliminated all environmental regulations. Firms could then 
produce goods and services without considering the pollution they create, and 
GDP might rise. Yet well-being would most likely fall. The deterioration in the 
quality of air and water would more than offset the gains from greater production.
GDP also says nothing about the distribution of income. A society in which 
100 people have annual incomes of $50,000 has GDP of $5 million and, not 
surprisingly, GDP per person of $50,000. So does a society in which 10 people

GDP Seen as 
Inadequate Measure 
of Economic Health 
By David Jolly
P
ARIS—President Nicolas Sarkozy told 
the French national statistics agency 
Monday to take greater account of factors 
like quality of life and the environment when 
measuring the country’s economic health. 
	
Mr. Sarkozy made the request after 
accepting a report from a panel of top 
economists he had charged with reviewing 
the adequacy of the current standard of fis-
cal well-being: gross domestic product. 
	
The panel, chaired by two Nobel econ-
omists, Joseph E. Stiglitz of Columbia 
University and Amartya Sen of Harvard 
University, concluded that GDP was insuf-
ficient and that measures of sustain-
ability and human well-being should be 
included. 
	
An “excessive focus on GDP metrics” 
also contributed to the onset of the current 
financial crisis, according to the report. Policy 
makers cheered rising economic growth 
while other data, like those that showed the 
increasing and unsustainable indebtedness of 
households and businesses, were overlooked, 
the report found. 
	
“The main message is to get away 
from GDP fetishism and to understand the 
limits to it,” Mr. Stiglitz said in an interview. 
“There are many aspects of our society that 
are not covered by GDP.”… 
	
GDP is the measure of the market value 
of all the goods and services produced in the 
economy. Its development in the 1930s, when 
the U.S. government was looking for new tools 
to measure national income and output more 
accurately, has been described as one of the 
most important advances in macroeconomics. 
	
However, there has long been criticism 
that, while it accurately captures the growth 
or contraction of the overall economy, it is 
a crude tool for describing social health. 
	
The United States, for example, with 
the world’s largest economy, naturally tops 
GDP rankings, but it ranks lower by other

earn $500,000 and 90 suffer with nothing at all. Few people would look at those 
two situations and call them equivalent. GDP per person tells us what happens 
to the average person, but behind the average lies a large variety of personal 
experiences.
In the end, we can conclude that GDP is a good measure of economic well-
being for most—but not all—purposes. It is important to keep in mind what GDP 
includes and what it leaves out.
International Differences in GDP and  
the Quality of Life
One way to gauge the usefulness of GDP as a measure of economic well-being is 
to examine international data. Rich and poor countries have vastly different levels 
of GDP per person. If a large GDP leads to a higher standard of living, then we 
should observe GDP to be strongly correlated with various measures of the qual-
ity of life. And, in fact, we do. 
measures. The United Nations Development 
Program’s human development index, which 
incorporates GDP as only one of a number 
of criteria, ranked Iceland, Norway and 
Canada the top three spots in 2008, with 
the United States a distant 15th. The human 
development indexes also seek to incorpo-
rate the value of a long and healthy life, 
access to knowledge and a decent standard 
of living. 
	
As an alternative to the developed 
world’s pursuit of GDP, the Himalayan 
kingdom of Bhutan has chosen to focus on 
“gross national happiness,” complete with 
the 4 pillars, the 9 domains and the 72 
indicators of happiness…. 
	
The Stiglitz commission report, known 
formally as “The Measurement of Economic 
Performance and Social Progress Revisited,” 
said that one of the most glaring problems with 
using economic growth as a proxy for well-
being was the fact that it excluded the damage 
to society and ultimately to the economy of 
environmentally non-sustainable activities. 
	
For instance, “developing countries 
may be encouraged to allow a foreign 
mining company to develop a mine, even 
though the country receives low royalties, 
even though the environment may be 
degraded, and even though miners may 
be exposed to health hazards,” the report 
says, “because by doing so GDP will be 
increased.” 
	
They also identify another problem with 
the reliance on GDP and other “standard” 
measures: the gap between what the 
numbers say and what people are actually 
experiencing. Over the course of recent 
decades, they note, GDP was rising in most 
of the world, even as the median disposable 
income—the income of the “representative 
individual”—was falling in many countries, 
meaning that a large share of the gains 
from economic growth ended up in the 
hands of the wealthy at the expense of 
the rest. 
	
The specific recommendations include 
ensuring that GDP itself is measured the 
same in every country, as statistical agen-
cies calculate it differently from one country 
to the next, leading in some cases, to large 
variations in the way government services 
are valued. That has the potential to lead to 
policy mistakes, they warned. 
	
“What we measure affects what we do; 
and if our measurements are flawed, deci-
sions may be distorted,” they wrote. “Policies 
should be aimed at increasing societal wel-
fare, not GDP.”

Table 3 shows twelve of the world’s most populous countries ranked in order 
of GDP per person. The table also shows life expectancy (the expected life span at 
birth), literacy (the percentage of the adult population who can read), and Internet 
usage (the percentage of the population that regularly uses the Internet). These 
data show a clear pattern. In rich countries, such as the United States, Japan, and 
Germany, people can expect to live to about 80, almost all of the population can 
read, and a half to two-thirds of the population uses the Internet. In poor countries, 
such as Nigeria, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, people typically die 10 to 20 years earlier, 
a substantial share of the population is illiterate, and Internet usage is rare. 
	
Data on other aspects of the quality of life tell a similar story. Countries with 
low GDP per person tend to have more infants with low birth weight, higher 
rates of infant mortality, higher rates of maternal mortality, higher rates of child 
malnutrition, and less common access to safe drinking water. In countries with 
low GDP per person, fewer school-age children are actually in school, and those 
who are in school must learn with fewer teachers per student. These countries also 
tend to have fewer televisions, fewer telephones, fewer paved roads, and fewer 
households with electricity. International data leave no doubt that a nation’s GDP 
per person is closely associated with its citizens’ standard of living.  ■
Quick Quiz  Why should policymakers care about GDP?
Conclusion
This chapter has discussed how economists measure the total income of a nation. 
Measurement is, of course, only a starting point. Much of macroeconomics is 
aimed at revealing the long-run and short-run determinants of a nation’s gross

domestic product. Why, for example, is GDP higher in the United States and 
Japan than in India and Nigeria? What can the governments of the poorest coun-
tries do to promote more rapid GDP growth? Why does GDP in the United States 
rise rapidly in some years and fall in others? What can U.S. policymakers do to 
reduce the severity of these fluctuations in GDP? These are the questions we will 
take up shortly. 
At this point, it is important to acknowledge the significance of just measur-
ing GDP. We all get some sense of how the economy is doing as we go about our 
lives. But the economists who study changes in the economy and the policymak-
ers who formulate economic policies need more than this vague sense—they need 
concrete data on which to base their judgments. Quantifying the behavior of the 
economy with statistics such as GDP is, therefore, the first step to developing a 
science of macroeconomics.
• Because every transaction has a buyer and a 
seller, the total expenditure in the economy must 
equal the total income in the economy. 
• Gross domestic product (GDP) measures an 
economy’s total expenditure on newly produced 
goods and services and the total income earned 
from the production of these goods and services. 
More precisely, GDP is the market value of all 
final goods and services produced within a 
country in a given period of time.
• GDP is divided among four components of expen-
diture: consumption, investment, government 
purchases, and net exports. Consumption includes 
spending on goods and services by households, 
with the exception of purchases of new housing. 
Investment includes spending on new equipment 
and structures, including households’ purchases 
of new housing. Government purchases include 
spending on goods and services by local, state, and 
federal governments. Net exports equal the value 
of goods and services produced domestically and 
sold abroad (exports) minus the value of goods 
and services produced abroad and sold domesti-
cally (imports).
• Nominal GDP uses current prices to value the 
economy’s production of goods and services. 
Real GDP uses constant base-year prices to value 
the economy’s production of goods and services. 
The GDP deflator—calculated from the ratio 
of nominal to real GDP—measures the level of 
prices in the economy.
• GDP is a good measure of economic well-being 
because people prefer higher to lower incomes. 
But it is not a perfect measure of well-being. For 
example, GDP excludes the value of leisure and 
the value of a clean environment.

Problems and Applications 
	 1.	 What components of GDP (if any) would each 
of the following transactions affect? Explain.
a.	 A family buys a new refrigerator.
b.	Aunt Jane buys a new house.
c.	 Ford sells a Mustang from its inventory.
d.	You buy a pizza.
e.	 California repaves Highway 101.
f.	 Your parents buy a bottle of French wine.
g.	Honda expands its factory in Marysville, 
Ohio.
	 2.	 The government purchases component of GDP 
does not include spending on transfer payments 
such as Social Security. Thinking about the 
definition of GDP, explain why transfer 
payments are excluded. 
	 3.	 As the chapter states, GDP does not include  
the value of used goods that are resold.  
Why would including such transactions make 
GDP a less informative measure of economic 
well-being?

a.	 Compute nominal GDP, real GDP, and the 
GDP deflator for each year, using 2010 as the 
base year.
b.	Compute the percentage change in nominal 
GDP, real GDP, and the GDP deflator in 
2011 and 2012 from the preceding year. For 
each year, identify the variable that does not 
change. Explain in words why your answer 
makes sense.
c. 	Did economic well-being rise more in 2011 or 
2012? Explain.
	 5.	 Consider an economy that produces only 
chocolate bars. In year 1, the quantity produced 
is 3 bars and the price is $4. In year 2, the 
quantity produced is 4 bars and the price is $5. 
In year 3, the quantity produced is 5 bars and 
the price is $6. Year 1 is the base year.
a.	 What is nominal GDP for each of these three 
years?
b.	What is real GDP for each of these years?
c.	 What is the GDP deflator for each of these years?
d.	What is the percentage growth rate of real 
GDP from year 2 to year 3?
e.	 What is the inflation rate as measured by the 
GDP deflator from year 2 to year 3?
f.	 In this one-good economy, how might you 
have answered parts (d) and (e) without first 
answering parts (b) and (c)?
Questions for Review
	 1.	 Explain why an economy’s income must equal 
its expenditure.
	 2.	 Which contributes more to GDP—the production 
of an economy car or the production of a luxury 
car? Why?
	 3.	 A farmer sells wheat to a baker for $2. The 
baker uses the wheat to make bread, which is 
sold for $3. What is the total contribution of 
these transactions to GDP?
	 4.	 Many years ago, Peggy paid $500 to put 
together a record collection. Today, she sold her 
albums at a garage sale for $100. How does this 
sale affect current GDP?
	 5.	 List the four components of GDP. Give an 
example of each.
	 6.	 Why do economists use real GDP rather  
than nominal GDP to gauge economic  
well-being?
	 7.	 In the year 2010, the economy produces 100 
loaves of bread that sell for $2 each. In the year 
2011, the economy produces 200 loaves of bread 
that sell for $3 each. Calculate nominal GDP, 
real GDP, and the GDP deflator for each year. 
(Use 2010 as the base year.) By what percentage 
does each of these three statistics rise from one 
year to the next?
	 8.	 Why is it desirable for a country to have a large 
GDP? Give an example of something that would 
raise GDP and yet be undesirable.

a.	 What was the growth rate of nominal GDP 
between 1999 and 2009? (Hint: The growth 
rate of a variable X over a N-year period is 
calculated as 100 × [(Xfinal/Xinitial)1/N – 1].)
b.	What was the growth rate of the GDP 
deflator between 1999 and 2009? 
c.	 What was real GDP in 1999 measured in 2005 
prices?
d.	What was real GDP in 2009 measured in 2005 
prices?
e.	 What was the growth rate of real GDP 
between 1999 and 2009?
f.	 Was the growth rate of nominal GDP higher 
or lower than the growth rate of real GDP? 
Explain.
	 7.	 Revised estimates of U.S. GDP are usually 
released by the government near the end of 
each month. Find a newspaper article that 
reports on the most recent release, or read the 
news release yourself at http://www.bea.gov, 
the website of the U.S. Bureau of Economic 
Analysis. Discuss the recent changes in real and 
nominal GDP and in the components of GDP. 
	 8.	 A farmer grows wheat, which he sells to a 
miller for $100. The miller turns the wheat into 
flour, which he sells to a baker for $150. The 
baker turns the wheat into bread, which he 
sells to consumers for $180. Consumers eat the 
bread. 
a.	 What is GDP in this economy? Explain.
b.	Value added is defined as the value of a 
producer’s output minus the value of the 
intermediate goods that the producer buys 
to make the output. Assuming there are no 
intermediate goods beyond those described 
above, calculate the value added of each of 
the three producers.
c.	 What is total value added of the three producers 
in this economy? How does it compare to the 
economy’s GDP? Does this example suggest 
another way of calculating GDP?
	 9.	 Goods and services that are not sold in markets, 
such as food produced and consumed at home, 
are generally not included in GDP. Can you 
think of how this might cause the numbers in 
the second column of Table 3 to be misleading 
in a comparison of the economic well-being of 
the United States and India? Explain.
10.	 The participation of women in the U.S. labor 
force has risen dramatically since 1970.
a.	 How do you think this rise affected GDP?
b.	Now imagine a measure of well-being that 
includes time spent working in the home and 
taking leisure. How would the change in this 
measure of well-being compare to the change 
in GDP?
c.	 Can you think of other aspects of well-being 
that are associated with the rise in women’s 
labor-force participation? Would it be 
practical to construct a measure of well-being 
that includes these aspects?
11. 	One day, Barry the Barber, Inc., collects $400 
for haircuts. Over this day, his equipment 
depreciates in value by $50. Of the remaining 
$350, Barry sends $30 to the government in sales 
taxes, takes home $220 in wages, and retains 
$100 in his business to add new equipment in 
the future. From the $220 that Barry takes home, 
he pays $70 in income taxes. Based on this 
information, compute Barry’s contribution to 
the following measures of income.
a.	 gross domestic product
b.	net national product
c.	 national income
d.	personal income
e.	 disposable personal income
